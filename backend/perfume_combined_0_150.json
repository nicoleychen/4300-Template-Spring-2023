Versace is launching a new fragrance for men \u2013 Eros inspired by and deeply connected with Greek mythology. The aim of this edition is to reveal and release unrestrained passion and to accentuate desire. The fragrance was named after Greek god of love and son of goddess Aphrodite \u2013 Eros. Inspiration by ancient Greece has lasted since the time when Gianni Versace raised his fashion empire and took goddess Medusa as symbol of the brand to adorn numerous products of the house, among them also the new flacon of men's fragrance Eros. The new perfume Eros is the first in the past five years to be launched and aimed at men. Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. \"Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace\" - explains Donatella. \"We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!\" Eros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way. Flacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus. Donatella wanted a man-gladiator for the new campaign, who is fighting for what he wants, fighting for his goals. \"This is a fragrance for a man who is his own master. He is a hero: a man who defends their ideas and goals.\" - stated Donatella Versace.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Espa\u00f1ol, Fran\u00e7ais, \u010ce\u0161tina, Italiano, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, Polski, Portugu\u00eas, \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac, \u6c49\u8bed, Nederlands, Srpski, Rom\u00e2n\u0103, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b, \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea.", "19": "La Nuit de l'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent is a Woody Spicy fragrance for men.

Very Good Girl was launched in 2021. Very Good Girl was created by Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner and Shyamala Maisondieu. Top notes are Litchi and Red Currant; middle note is Rose; base notes are Vanilla and Vetiver. At the beginning of February 2021, Carolina Herrera presents a new flanker in an attractive bright red stiletto bottle. Red is definitely a trend in 2021 because many houses have decided to offer new creations in red bottles. It is composed by Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner and Shyamala Maisondieu. Very Good Girl is a new olfactory adventure that takes a surprising turn: Where previous fragrances in the family explored the subversive power of jasmine or the tonka bean, this new Eau de Parfum ups the ante, drawing its strength from the potency of the rose, a\u00a0distinctive scent,\u00a0which here treads on entirely new ground. VERY GOOD GIRL arrives after last year's creation, Good Girl Supr\u00eame, and Good Girl L\u00e9g\u00e8re from 2018. They\u00a0stand out\u00a0as different compositions from the other editions of the collection, which were limited edition bottles of the original Good Girl creation from 2016. As the brand explains: \"Rose and vetiver: an idyllic contrast. Very Good Girl is a Floral Fruity fragrance. Its aromatic journey starts with the currant, a playfully mischievous wild berry that\u2019s joined by the exotic lychee in a unity of confidence. It\u2019s at this point that the singular yet mysterious qualities of the rose come into play. As one of the most important raw ingredients in the history of perfumery, it has previously seen countless interpretations. All-encompassing and seductive, its unique scent is an ace up any sleeve, which is exactly what perfumers Quentin Bisch and Louise Turner capitalized on for this new chapter in the Good Girl universe.\" \"Here, it\u2019s the creamy and powdery nuances of the rose that come to the fore, with an indulgent romanticism that\u2019s as warm and silky as the world\u2019s most seductive red lipstick. There\u2019s no need to justify a declaration of love for this most luxurious of ingredients, and even if this were reason enough to create a fragrance, Quentin Bisch and Louise Turner are anything but a conformist. Hence why the final burst in Very Good Girl is a veiled background of vetiver, the raw form of which evokes the smell of wood, and is often used in men\u2019s perfumery. It\u2019s a key ingredient of Bad Boy, for example, but also of Good Girl Supr\u00eame, providing a surprising and contemporary counterpoint that in this new fragrance creates an alliance with the warmth of vanilla. The result is a floral fragrance that enhances the natural beauty of its raw ingredients, but without forgoing creativity.\" As Carolina Herrera famously said, \u201cFashion is evolution, not revolution,\u201d a maxim that fully applies to this new fragrance. Just as when Wes Gordon modernizes timeless materials such as silk or leather when designing fashion for the brand, the rose is used with a completely contemporary aesthetic. This is why Very Good Girl is not only a tour de force for the senses, it\u2019s also a fragrance that\u2019s ready to wear and enjoy in the modern world. The red bottle is not the first in the collection, but it differs in design.\u00a0Good Girl Velvet Fatale was the first red fragrance of the collection made in a bottle of dark red velvet, while the new creation is as shiny and glassy as the original edition. The true fans of the line now have a new object of desire. VERY GOOD GIRL comes on the market in mid-February in 50ml and 80ml Eau de Parfum bottles.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Espa\u00f1ol, Fran\u00e7ais, \u010ce\u0161tina, Italiano, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, Polski, Portugu\u00eas, \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac, \u6c49\u8bed, Nederlands, Srpski, Rom\u00e2n\u0103, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b, \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea.", "82": "Eilish by Billie Eilish is a Amber Vanilla fragrance for women.

I have smelled over 30 fragrances that afternoon and this is the only one that got stuck in my head. It has been over two months since I sniffed it and I cannot get it out of my head. I have never experienced this before. It is a strange experience. It's like I can smell it by just thinking about it. So I could not stop myself from buying a bottle. \nThis fragrance is more than a scent. It is a scented journey. An olfactory wonder. A masterpiece. There is something about this scent, the way it smells, the way it performs. It is the most mysterious fragrance I own. When you spray it on, you smell it, but you kind of not smell it. However, even if you do not smell it, you know it is there. You sort of 'feel' its presence. \nI have not worn it in public yet, because it is quite a daring fragrance and a bit on the feminine side if you ask me. \nI bought a 200ml bottle and decided to decant 100ml of it, to pay off some of the mortgage I had to take to buy a bottle. The tube coming out of the bottle is not really suited to extract the juice with a syringe, so I taped-off a beaker and sprayed the juice until I got the required amount of juice needed for my decants (yes, my finger hurt afterwards). After filling the vials, I put the beaker in a room upstairs.The empty (yes, empty) beaker has been standing in this room for one week and the whole room has been smelling like Baccarat Rouge for one week. This is beyond beastmode. \nScent: 11/10\nProjection: 11/10 (Projects very far for a good 4 hours and does not really come close to the skin for another 4 hours)\nSillage: 10/10\nLongevity: 11/10 (14h+ on skin, days on clothes)\nVersatility 7/10 (Only for the coolest of days)\nUniqueness: 9/10\nPrice-performance: 9/10 (It is expensive, but beautiful and beastly)\nTotal: 9.5", "1": "First of all, Baccarat Rouge 540 is a phenomenon of modern perfumery. And no matter how we all feel about it, Francis Kurkdjian wrote his name in history. There are no more than fifteen ingredients in the composition formula, and most of them are well-read. They are collected in three main chords: woody, gourmand, and amber. The woody accord is based on Evernyl (a synthetic analog of oakmoss) \u2014 pure smell, combined with synthetic saffron material, that reminds of medical bandages. The perfumer added a touch of cedarwood for softening and iso e super for the same purposes, but also to create an even woody-ambery background. The gourmand accord is represented by two bright and well-perceived elements: ethyl maltol with a characteristic smell of strawberries, cotton candy, burnt sugar, and fir balsam absolute. The second has a very unusual and beautiful aroma, which has balsamic, coniferous, and fruity shades with an emphasis on strawberries and a smooth syrupy texture. \nIt is because of the combination of ethyl maltol, fir balm, and evernyl that the aroma reminds many of the smell and taste of cockerels on a stick - the famous caramel in the past. Those who feel mainly bandages are more likely to have an increased sensitivity to Evernyl and its combination with the spicy steroid ambergris that defines the vertical of Baccarat Rouge 540. Due to the small number of components in the formula (most of them are very intense and potent), the aroma is perceived so clearly. \nConsumers are divided into two opposing camps. Of course, the attitude to the composition is formed by the individual characteristics of perception, as well as increased and decreased sensitivities, which manifest themselves the brighter, the fewer components in the composition of the aroma. Baccarat Rouge is one of those compositions, the balance of which is not easy to talk about just because of the short formula. However, in my opinion, the perfumer has built a non-trivial balance. Yes, it is strange, perhaps fragile, and not obvious to someone at all, but I see it and understand that it is rather difficult to work with such powerful components. But Kurkdjian came up with something much more than just a perfume product. He created an object of art, the attitude towards which only confirms its significance.", "2": "This perfume is an olfactory chameleon.\nI can smell strawberry marmalade, blood orange juice, pink cotton candy, iodine tincture, tutti frutti toothpaste & saffron butter cookies. \nThe scent is hot, sweet, metallic, bloody & salty, everything at once.\nAnd I love it. \nI get butterflies in my stomach when I wear this perfume. \nThis scent is just incredibly exciting.\nAs for me, this perfume is an unmistakable solitaire.", "3": "I used to have a really good friend when I was a teenager - he used to go out with my sister when I was younger and after they broke up I remained friends with him. We used to sit around at his house down the road; swap books, listen to music. His Mum ran a beauticians from the house - it was a big house with an annex that she had converted into this beauty spa. She did facials, massages, aromatherapy and all that stuff for the local women. I always loved the scent of their house - like sweet berries mixed with chamomile, soft leather jackets and something antiseptic coming from the beautician's annex. It was comforting and captivating. It was such a strong and distinctive smell that all their family carried around on their clothes and bodies - I have often tried to find a scent that carries that smell. I haven't ever been able to find it. \nHis Mother died of cancer at a relatively young age - not long after the time I used to go round almost every day. When I tried Baccarat Rouge 540 for the first time, it brought back the memory of his mother so strongly for me. It doesn't smell exactly like the scent of their house - it is missing some aspect of the chamomile and leather I remember, though the saffron in Baccarat evokes that feel at a parallel - but it just took me straight back to that time. Something about the sweet scent of expensive oils and lotions mixed with the tang of antiseptic fluid she used to keep the room clean. I love this perfume - I think it's a true work of art to be capable of evoking such emotion in the wearer. I have many perfumes that I like very much and that give me great pleasure; very few of them make me feel something like this does.", "4": "When I die, before you bury me spoil on me a bottle of Baccarat, then I will be ready to go to heaven......", "5": "This Fragrance holds a very special place in my wardrobe.  First, I wore this fragrance for the first time on my Engagement trip with my wife.  The scent memories always take me back to the island. Number 2 I was able to meet Francis and get my bottle signed.  Needless to say this is now and may forever be my number one.  \n\nMy Rating: 10/10", "6": "This was my fragrance on my birthday. Baccarat Rouge 540 is absolutely beautiful. At first blast, you get a woody amber with warm spices. Kinda like a burnt brown sugar. The sweetness and woody notes are blended perfectly. There is a hint of florals but the cedar is more prominent in the dry down. Performance is excellent! There's a good reason this perfumery is being copied (excuse me ... inspired).", "7": "I don't care what the haters say, this perfume deserves the hype it gets. \n\nI absolutely LOVE this perfume. Hands down, one of the most complex and unique scents I own in my collection (thank you, husband for getting this for me!). While I know there are a lot of dupes and replicas of this perfume, they really don't hold a candle to BR540. I've tried Burberry Her Intense and own AG's Cloud. Burberry Her to me, only smells like BR540 from the atomizer but once sprayed it is its own scent. Cloud on the other hand is very similar to BR540, like I would say 85% so if you don't have 300 plus dollars just lying around and want a similar version, Cloud would be your best choice. However, Cloud is much sweeter due to the whipped cream and coconut and less complex. A younger sister of BR540, the one that steals her sister's clothes because she's just that cool. \n\nBR540 is still sweet but is also spicy and warm, which is due to the fir and ambergris. It's also slightly herbal and smoky from the saffron in the opening note. I don't pick up on any jasmine. As many people have said, if a scent was resinous, this would be it. It's such a unique scent that I don't want it to be an everyday scent so I save it for special occasions or on days where I want to feel like a Boss Lady.\n\nPerformance wise, this is just a pure beast. It stays on clothes FOREVER. Like two weeks later I'll open my closet and get a whiff of it from a shirt I wore. I do agree that sometimes you, the wearer can't smell it, but those around you will be able to smell you. \n\nI am glad it is getting the love it deserves and even with so many people loving this scent, I've only encountered maybe two people wearing this perfume? If you can afford this perfume and love it, get this niche superstar and add it to your collection.", "8": "Warm, airy, opulent, rich, luxurious fluffy cotton candy, woody, cozy carmalized slightly burnt sugar, and musky perfection. Perfectly unisex. Every time I smell this fragrance I have a vision of buoyant sanguine cheeked curly haired cherubs floating around me with pristine white feathered wings playing a beautiful melody on mini harps. The Olfactory experience is light and innoffensive, polished and enveloping with a beastly sillage. Longevity is eons, especially on clothes. To sum it up, BR540 is what heaven must smell like!!! Love at first sniff. Smells like money! Worth every penny!!!", "9": "You know that feeling when your hair is silky, your legs are smooth, your skin is glowing, you went to the gym and your muscles are toned, you take a shower, apply Baccarat Rouge 540 and instantly feel in the mood for love? That's what this perfume makes me feel :)", "10": "BR540 EDP and Extrait are both fantastic to me with the Extrait taking the edge.\n\nThe EDP:\n\n70% Dentist Office\n30% Cotton Candy\n\nThe Extrait:\n\n30% Dentist Office\n60% Cotton Candy\n10% Almond\n\nA great scent that is tongue in cheek like selling cotton candy at the dentist but which is so strangely beautiful and alluring.", "11": "Forget about the hype, forget about the cloud comparisons, forget about Tiktok, forget the world for a second and just admit that this perfume truly is unique, this is a masterpiece. My nose likes to smell this, period.", "12": "What can I say...beautiful. Very intimate and does not scream for attention, doesn\u2019t cause headache or burning on skin and nostrils. it is truly remarkable scent.", "13": "OH MY GOD! This is one of the most unique scents I have ever smelled! Nothing out there smells even close to this beauty. The candy-sweet and ambery opening turns into a minty fresh still a candy-sweet scent with subtle hints of sweet and fresh spices coming through. It is so unique yet so familiar, like when you meet someone new and you get the feeling you actually known them your whole life.\n\nI was wondering for a long time what all the hype surrounding this perfume was about. Well, now I know!\n\nThe projection during the day is not very strong, more close to the skin. However it actually lasts for days! Great all-year-round and everyday scent.\n\nGREETINGS FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC! :)", "14": "After owning and wearing on /off this frag for more than a month, here is what I learnt:\n1. Francis Kurkdjian is a freaking magician (or genius if you like)\n2. This perfume varies astronomically on different skins (meaning on me it's something,  on you it could be a different planet)\n3. This perfume is addictive and l can't figure out why\n4. I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nThat said, it took me more than a year before venturing into buying a decant of this famous Baccarat Rouge 540. You know why?  Because i was afraid it were similar to the Ariana Grande Cloud, as almost everyone was comparing them, and to me Cloud is ok-ish but too teenage girl sweet. In the end i thought: \" it can't be true, Francis Kurkdjian cannot do a coconut candy-floss jam\".\nAnd I was right. There is nothing coconutty candyfloss-like in BR540. At least on my skin (pls see point 2. above).\nThis perfume is a revelation. You wear it and it's like new worlds were opening before your eyes.\nIt is airy. Transparent and pure like crystal. It has a freshness impossible to describe (maybe the jasmine/bordering orange blossom accounts for that) but its not a citrus, nor summer like nor aquatic freshness. It could be the saffron as well.\nYou breathe and it makes you feel good.\nThat said, this concoction varies through the day and is different on different days (could be temperature, skin acidity, hormones whatever).\nI get sometimes a waft of the so dreaded  \"dentists office\" vibe, but it lasts seconds. I thing this sort of metallic note stands for the lead powder used to make crystal. It could be rendered by the saffron as well, it has a pungent medicinal vibe.\nI also get sometimes a candy sweet note, totally pleasant.\nI mainly get a delicate flower freshness, but this is a reductive description cause BR540 is the most intriguing and multifaceted fragrance.\nIt's very delicate: the sillage is modest, it will stay in your bubble discretely (no one complimented  me on this frag, meaning it isn't very loud and/or people won't notice) but you will be smelling it for almost 12 hours on your skin, longevity is outstanding. More even on clothes.\nYou'll wear it for your own delight. And you'll keep on sniffing, wanting more (please see point 3.).\nAnd I cannot compare it to any other fragrance  i own or smelled before (hence, point 1.).\nHow could i wait so long before getting it? \nProbably the price; yep it is definitely overpriced.  But... \nWhat an experience!", "15": "Just the most beautiful thing in the world...Super high quality, beast mode status and wonderful well structured perfume for me. To me this smells NOTHING like any of the notes listed. Smells like a sweet pastry store to me. Also like squished strawberries mixed with caramelized sugar...with a touch of saffron... \n\nHowever! When I smelled this I though that everyone will LOVE this and there is no way someone could not like this perfume. Boy was I wrong...Everyone I asked what do they think said it smells like hospital, death, retirement and the most specific was the reaction of my boyfriend: \"a purulent wound repeatably covered with the same, already soaked bandage on a senior female\". I have no words for these comments...I just do not understand where do they come from whatsoever.", "16": "By far, my most complimented fragrance. I received two compliments from strangers in the span of one hour. I really just wear fragrance for me, but it is nice when someone else can appreciate it in a positive way.\n\nI have both EDP & Extrait & they are both in my top 10. I can\u2019t speak on dupes or fragrances that \u201csmell like\u201d but Baccarat Rouge 540 is genius level perfumery IMHO.\n\nThe only \u201cdownside\u201d to Baccarat is I experience anosmia if I wear either one too often or by over spraying. I have to take a break with both. I feel both wear better in colder weather & if you can\u2019t smell it, rest assured others can & will comment: \u201cwhat\u2019s that smell? Omg that smells so good!\u201d.", "17": "I got a whiff of this just last Friday, without even knowing that this was a much-hyped perfume. But, oh my, it was love at first sniff! I agree with Ky1227, this smells really expensive. And unfortunately for me, it IS very expensive, too much for me to shell out for a perfume. But it also has me considering saving up for even the 3-piece sampler kit.\n\nI find Baccarat Rouge 540 very well-blended, exuding a rich burnt ambery aroma that is elegantly sweet, and just a tad salty and woody. Absolutely captivating from the beginning, and settling so well that it feels like it is a part of me. Very elegant and high quality (the perfume, not me =D), I think it would be an ideal perfume for special occasions, but it is also very wearable even for a regular day. (However, given the price point, I really would save it for special occasions, should I have this in my wardrobe.)\n\nThe sales assistant sprayed this on one wrist, at around 1:00 PM, and I still kept getting blissful whiffs of it in the evening when I got home. I could even still catch a faint aroma after my shower.\n\nAnd the sample card that I kept in my bag scented just about everything in it! I already put away some of the things that were in my bag and when I walk past them in my room, I could still catch whiffs of this amazing scent! (Granted, I'm not sure if it was this or the Extrait de Parfum version, which I also sprayed on a sample card.)\n\nI am so in love with this fragrance! It rocketed to the top of my wish list, but I can't imagine how I can possibly get my hands on this! :))\n\nEdit:  One week later and I can still get faint whiffs of this when I walk by the bag I place the tester cards in.", "18": "What strikes me the most about Baccarat Rouge 540 is the contrasting elements, it\u2019s weightless yet profound scent profile, translucent yet gigantic in the way in which it presents itself while suspended in the air, Baccarat packs such a punch that it\u2019s olfactive ghost can only be described as everlasting.\nThe scent is mostly built around synthetics unfolding on first blast with a duality of saffron jasmine, and dominant ambroxan and evernil, each of these being isolated molecules of ambergris and oakmoss, but beautifully layered in Kurkdjian\u2019s style, utilizing skillful blending techniques.\nThe genius blends rests on a sweet vanilla woody ambery base that displays a dry character, reminiscent to norlimbanol molecule (firmenich)\nAs for Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait, this formulation particularly wows me the most, as everything that made it\u2019s predecessor special and unique is carefully treated here and perfected with silky smooth transitions, added nutty almondy effect and sweeter tones.\nBaccarat Rouge is the blueprint of a master perfumer, a man gifted with talent, Kurkdjian is a master at his craft, and his capabilities of creating memorable olfactive portraits goes beyond naturals or synthetics.", "19": "The most amazing perfume ever!!! Sexy but elegant, sweet but not gourmand, woody but not masculine. It\u2019s perfectly balanced. Perfume for the rest of my life.", "20": "I currently own this fragrance, and have worn it every day for the past month.\n\nThe first time I heard of this fragrance was through searching for another MFK fragrance that I had recently heard of (OSM). One of my friends had shared their purchase to their instagram page, and it sparked my curiosity. In searching for MFK, I came across BR540. I'm an avid reader of reviews. I had never seen such zealous reviews for a fragrance before. Most of the reviewers seemed to think this was the best stuff in the world, and that it smelled like \"burnt cotton candy.\" While laying in bed one eve, I felt a bit daring. Although I'm not a fan of sweet fragrances, I went on Neiman Marcus' website and placed an order. Instantly, became worried that I just made the worst most expensive blind purchase of my little life. A few days of waiting for this thing to arrive, proved to be too much, so a few days later, I took the 30 minute ride out to the mall to smell a sample.\n\nWhen I got into the store, almost immediately, I noticed an entire MFK wall. I had been in Neiman Marcus before, and never noticed it. As I approached the counter, one of the workers in a small group of employees approached me, and asked me what I was looking for. I mentioned BR540, and her face positively lit up. She showed me to the counter, and without delay, pulled out a sample card, and one of the sample bottles. \n\nOf course I was instantly drawn to the elegance of the bottle, but more on that in a bit.\n\nThe woman pressed the atomizer and a short blast of mist came out onto the card. I pulled my mask away from my nose, and was instantly confused. Was that it? I detected a peculiar scent. It was vaguely sweet, like a faint candy, faint fruity aura. But, it seemed a bit fresh... maybe a bit spicy... something salty... something something aquatic maybe. I felt underwhelmed. Disappointed. I took the card and wafted it in front of my face. Way to blow $325. \n\nPerhaps the woman didn't recognize my disappointment; she continued to rave about how popular this fragrance was. But I wasn't listening. Only a few moments had passed, and I was hit with abrupt bewilderment. The scent was present in the air the whole time, but I was suddenly starstruck by it. I'm not quite sure what washed over me in that moment, but I was in LOVE. I waved the card in the air and sniffed again. It smelled like cotton candy in the sun... it smelled like cedar crystallized in sugar. It smelled expensive... luxurious. Something high quality was in the air. It was a sparkling transparent, iridescent fragrance that seemed to dance about. \"Oh my God... that's lovely...\" I whispered nearly to myself.\n\nMy buyer's remorse vanished. I knew I would love this fragrance.\n\nIn the month that I've worn it, I've noticed the following:\n\n(1) It is popular, but only in the fragrance community and in wealthy circles. TBH, if you're a regular guy like me, most of the people you interact with will never have heard of/smelled this fragrance, which leads me to\n(2) What makes this fragrance unique is in part due to how unique the fragrance is. It is familiar and alien at the same time, and the first time someone smells it will be the most magical experience, if they \"get it\"\n(3) Not everyone will get it.\n(4) Most people will become anosmic to this at some point due to proximity or volume. If you spray too much too close, or if your nose is not built for it, you'll stop smelling it. The fragrance will literally disappear. However, if this happens, you can rest assured that everyone near you will smell it because\n(5) It is a projection BEAST. A few sprays will fill a room. However, it is a transparent fragrance. This means that usually, when you wear it, it will fill a whole room shortly after you enter (depending on the ventilation and size of the room) BUT, it is not overpowering. It is extremely present but not overpowering. It is so transparent that\n(6) Even though it is a compliment god, most of the compliments you get wont be aimed at you. It'll be compliments about how good the area smells. But this fragrance projects so well, many people will not be able to tell where it's coming from, so however many compliments you hear-- triple that. That's how many people can probably smell it but don't know its you or aren't sure what they're smelling.\n(7) To avoid anosmia, avoid spraying above your chest/front of your neck. If you have to spray that high, spray the back of your neck. \n\nThis stuff is magic. I just ordered the 6.8 oz bottle.Speaking of, I nearly forgot. The bottles are lovely. They're simple heavy glass cubes with a solid, gold toned top. They feel high quality. Fitting for a fragrance of this caliber.\n\nDefinitely give it a try. Don't take my word for it or anyone's really. You have to smell it for yourself to see if you like it.", "21": "If you want to fix your nose blindness to BR540, I have a suggestion.\n\n1- Never smell BR540 directly on the sprayer, or on the cap, just STAY AWAY from the juice itself.\n\n2- Do not spray or smell any fragrance for a day or two days, let your nose rest.\n\n3- Spray it only once on something, like on a shirt, that is in another room than you spend your time in, then immediately leave the room, do not smell the initial blast. Like just spray BR540 once on something, hold your breath, and leave the room. Trust me with this one. Lol.\n\n4- Come back 5 minutes later and smell the room the shirt is in.\n\nThe room is now supposed to smell how BR540 smells to other people, like the famous burnt cotton candy. Be careful though, it is addictive :)\n\nNOTE: Do not directly smell the shirt, or you will go nose blind to it again. If you let your nose-brain learn the smell, it will stop making you go nose blind and you will be able to pick it up anytime. But it might take some time. This happens to some of us because this fragrance has very heavy molecules for our noses.", "22": "Well, I finally got my sample in the mail today! I will give you a backwards review: This is Ariana Grande CLOUD with a lot of DEPTH and NUANCE. There. That's it. No medicine smell , no bandages, nothing foul at all. \n\nIf I was rich- I'd buy 20 back-up bottles right now! Alas, I am working-class-poor. At least I now know what this smells like and I can dream about a full bottle, someday.......\nOh well.....", "23": "ok, it is not an unusual fragrance but it is remarkable and does not give a headache although it has a strong sillage. on me, it smells like burnt sugar but in a luxurious way. You can smell the quality and it seperates this fragrance from other sweet fragrances.\ni always get compliments while wearing it especially from men. i really love the fragrance but do not blind buy it", "24": "We've all heard the hype, that it is super sugary sweet and it also smells like hospitals and the dentist. well i'm a dentist and when i sprayed it, it immediately reminded me of the clinic, the latex gloves and the antiseptic spray which is used to wipe surfaces. and it becomes more subtle as it dries down. but this fragrance is not sweet at all, it has a slight sweetness which i like, but i would never call it a \"cotton candy sweet\". and i didn't find Baccarat Rouge to be very unique, i have definitely smelled something similar before. even though it has that latexy vibe, it's surprisingly pleasant, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. and it isn't as strong as MFK's other fragrances, when you smell it directly on skin. However, everyone arounds you notices the fragrance.", "25": "Baccarat Rouge seems almost too simple at first. You get a light whiff of something sweet--a vague cotton candy note over a nondescript synthetic woods, and an odd off-note that smells strangely like glue and...that's it. It seems unfinished. Incomplete and empty. Flat. But then you wear it again a couple more times and suddenly it opens itself up to you. The sweetness becomes addicting, bolder and harder to label. It's not like cotton candy at all really. The woodiness holding it together develops a fuzzy texture and you notice its tenaciousness on your skin and that its deeper than you first perceived. The fir resin becomes the star of the show, presenting something more in line with the sweet sap of a pine tree than an artificial candy. Beneath it there is a warm, alluring nuttiness that permeates the scent.  It jumps out even more on fabric causing your shirt to smell wonderful.  It blends with the sweet and I'm reminded of Boston Baked Beans.The next time you wear Baccarat Rouge the jasmine shows up, adding a new dimension to the opening, a pretty touch of florals to help balance the sweet woody aroma that dominates. Suddenly, the fragrance is not as simple as you'd first thought. This is an addictive smell that gets better and better the more you wear it. It's a compliment magnet. I haven't met one person who dislikes it on me and in fact I've received positive comments from complete strangers (which almost never happens to me). It seems to genuinely make people happy and draw them in. When you wear this, you'll catch wafts of it throughout the day, and you'll think \"mmmm...something smells really good,\" and at first you might not even realize it's you. The same happened to me when I began wearing Amyris Homme. But then you realize that indeed, the smell is coming from you, and more specifically, from Baccarat Rouge. Then you're hooked. It's been chided for being cloying and overly-sweet and synthetic, but I actually find the composition to be on the subtle side. It's no shrinking violet but it's not loud in any way, and it's not obnoxious. Its different aspects reveal themselves patiently, everything's not upfront and in your face. Sample this, to see if it has the same effect on you, but be sure to wear it at least two times. I recommend three. Baccarat Rouge is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. It's a pleasure to wear and it seems to be received remarkably well. Thumbs up!", "26": "I really don\u2019t know what to think about this fragrance, it\u2019s obviously quite divisive. The opening is very sweet, like confectionery, and to me a synthetic strawberry jam accord is clearly evident. I am not aware of any high end fragrance that opens like this and although it\u2019s surprising and delicious, it is something I associate with children and very cheap fragrances. This dichotomy is confusing, but also quite fascinating.\nThe medicinal smell that reminds some people of hospitals emerges shortly after the opening, but it is embedded in sweetness and woods and not at all unpleasant. It ramps up the confusion and fascination.\nIt\u2019s probably the work of a genius, as it\u2019s quietly very provocative and keeps me endlessly wanting to smell my wrist every few minutes.\n\nUpdate: After a few wearings I have grown to love this unique and beautiful fragrance, which continues to fascinate me!", "27": "I almost hate myself for loving this so much!\n\nIf you are looking for a luxe, well-rounded gourmand and have a few organs to donate... if you are a fan of Indult 'Tihota' meets Maison Margiela 'By the fireplace', this is something you should experience! \n\nI was browsing a fragrance counter and the sales associate, based on my love for MFK and my ~style~ suggested this one would fit me like a glove. I shrugged that suggestion off after a quick sniff because it genuinely felt like she was trying to sell me the most expensive thing on the floor... but It was the only fragrance in the past year that grabbed my attention right away and I couldn't get it off my mind.\n\n\nAS A SELF-PROCLAIMED RETIRED VANILLA-FANATIC... this fit right into my cozy comfort zone of sweetness with depth, a little bit burnt, a little bit full of cashmere, a little bit musky, a little bit unisex... this stuff is like slipping into a red velvet disco catsuit. All eyes (noses) on you. Burnt sugar, fireplace, a wisp of pine sap... strangely ethereal, if it works for you.\n\nI have NEVER fared well with cedar, resinous notes and especially jasmine... but here I am facing my ultimate fragrance nightmare concoction with open arms. Running towards it on the beach, Baywatch style.\n\nI, against my shoulder angel's wishes... shelled out for the full bottle, and what really sold me was the length of time this lasts. I spray sparingly, since I don't like being 'that guy', but 9 hours+ later I'm still surrounded by a soft veil of Baccarat Rouge. No burnt rubbery weirdness, no benzoin avalanche drydown nightmare... this is the first time I'm pleased to flaunt a fairly linear fragrance. \n\nIs this unlike ANYTHING out there... no! Is this well-crafted, cozy, and something of a staple? I think so.", "28": "Baccarat Rouge is a peculiar fragrance, but peculiar in the best way. It\u2019s taken me a while to feel comfortable reviewing this much-loved fragrance, but after a couple of months of wear I finally feel able to.\u2028\u2028\n\nI've had quite a journey with Baccarat Rouge. My first sample was from Lucky Scent, but I genuinely hate that they don\u2019t come in a spray bottle, so off I went to the MFK website (which has an amazing sample service). The first time I got to spray Baccarat Rouge it smelled\u2026 different. I was greeted by a musky citrus that I had never experienced with my Lucky Scent sample. Then the scent all but disappeared.\u2028\u2028\n\nThat\u2019s part of the beauty of Baccarat Rouge. It takes you on a journey. It truly is a chameleon of a fragrance.\u2028\u2028\n\nAs I went about my day, I started to get wafts of the Baccarat Rouge I had come to know. Sometimes it smells like burnt sugar. Sometimes it smells like the salty air near the beach. Sometimes it smells woody, and sometimes I do understand why other people smell a dentist\u2019s office. It keeps changing, it keeps disappearing and then coming back. However, even though you might not be able to smell it each time you press your nose to your wrist, you can be sure it\u2019s there until you wash it off. I once had a hairband around my wrist while spraying this, and it smelled like Baccarat Rouge for a month. You\u2019ll thinks the perfume has worn off, and then you\u2019ll suddenly be enveloped in a cloud of Baccarat Rouge. There\u2019s something addictive about it. \u2028\u2028\n\nThe first time I tried BR, it wasn\u2019t what I had expected at all. It was unlike anything I had ever tried, and somehow felt like it had a masculine note that caught me off guard after having seen it described as a gourmand. I still don\u2019t think Baccarat Rouge is a gourmand, in spite of the fact that it often reminds me of burnt sugar. Baccarat Rouge is simply Baccarat Rouge. Francis Kurkdjian has created something beyond description.\u2028\u2028\n\nI don\u2019t think this is a blind buy. I don\u2019t think this will appeal to everyone, in spite of its popularity. But it\u2019s a fragrance that will at least surprise you, and smell unlike anything else - not even the many promised dupes, that in my opinion never have that 'je ne sais quoi' that Baccarat Rouge has. There would be days where I couldn't stand wearing it, and days where I craved it. It took me a while to fully appreciate Baccarat Rouge, but now I don't want to ever be without it.", "29": "WOW WOW WOW, this is a great perfume and no body can hate it, either you love it or love it, simple LUXURY, MFK is a legend and he is the best modern perfumer", "30": "This one is SO weird.....\n\nIt is so different.....it is so unisex....but....it is so good!\n\n***Disclaimer: I am a 26 Year Old Male that only likes macho frags....***\n\n\nThere is something about BR540 that I cannot get over. I think I know what it is. I believe that it is the overall deliciousness and complexity of this seemingly simple scent. \n\nAt first I didn't like it and couldn't understand how men could wear this proudly. On my second attempt weeks later, it clicked in my head/nose. I took it seriously this time and it paid off. \n\nAfter my second purchase of the sample, I just decided to wear it out...6 heavy shots to the neck..and WOW!

We have a history.  I discovered it at Neiman Marcus when it first launched a few years ago.  I was headed for the escalators to leave the store when I walked past an associate and stopped dead in my tracks.  I turned around and walked right over to her to ask what fragrance she was wearing.  She smirked and motioned me to follow her to the MFK counter.  She reached for a bottle and said--in her French accent, \"it's Baccarat.\"  \n\nI eagerly sprayed it on myself but was a little disappointed as it just didn't have the same affect. So, I reluctantly passed it up.  A few years later, this fragrance was gifted to me by my lovely significant other. Although I'm SO happy to have a bottle I'm not sure I'd purchase a full bottle myself. Hmm. Yes, this perfume gets me lots of compliments and big reactions.  I truly believe the magic of this fragrance is all in the sillage.  It's ALL about the sillage.  So now when I wear it, I spray into the air to create a cloud and then walk through it.  I find this application works best with this fragrance--for me.  I don't consider it an everyday scent.  It's a mood and I have to be in it.", "32": "An interesting story with this one. More than a year ago I have ordered a sample of this, just to understand why everyone is so raving about it. And that was such a disappointment, cos, like many here, I just smelled hospital and iodine. I washed my blouse after using it, but it did not wash away, that was annoying. I was so disguised by that smell, that could not be in one room with someone wearing this perfume. \nA year passed, and I started to catch myself sniffing and enjoying when someone passes by with this perfume (yes, here, in Lithuania, this perfume is very popular). And, oh well, I bought a bottle of it, and I do not smell hospital anymore, only a sparkling brown sugar, and I got sooo addicted, that cannot wait to spray it again and again. I understand that it can be annoying to some people, though. Therefore I use it in moderate amounts :)\nSo, a resume, I'd say, nose changes over time, and what one smelt some time ago is absolutely different after a while.", "33": "I was at Neiman Marcus yesterday just because I was so INTRIGUED by the overwhelming praises for Baccarat Rouge 540. I sampled it immediately by spraying it  lightly on the back of my hand and on a cardigan I was wearing. The image that immediately came to my mind was my white t-shirt after being worn for 2 days straight on a clean body without any fragrance or cosmetic worn. Its very familiar, it something that I have known for a long time! Other images that came in my mind were white sugar being cooked to high heat, cotton candy, and strawberries (without the vegetal/fruity facet). Projection and sillage is minimal to moderate for at least 4 hours on the hand, and becomes a skin scent after that; on clothes its at least 12 hours. After it dries down to skin scent, it reminded me of CK One dry down (maybe the hedione and oakmoss?). It seems to me that the 3 top aroma molecules that were used here were ambroxan (could be te natural ambergris, hence the expensive price), ethyl maltol (sugary sweet smell minus the vanilla), and hedione (nuance of jasmine). \n\nI can definitely smell other facets such as the dentist chair, ashtray/white smoke, burnt strawberry/caramel strawberry, hospital, band-aid/gauze with covering a fleshy wound, burnt rubber, and salt.\n\nI dont understand the rave reviews and high rating. Maybe to some people this is an attractive, sexy smell but to me this a smell of my old white t-shirt or cotton candy!\n\nHas this recently been reformulated?", "34": "I own a lot of fragrances and none of them have a heartbeat....this one does. It's hard to explain. Sometimes I don't smell anything at all and then I catch a big waft. The initial spray smells like cotton candy but as it starts to dry down it gets more intense....but it's gotta be the most pleasant sweet smelling fragrance I've ever smelled. \n\nTo be honest, I don't really know what notes are in it or what I'm smelling exactly. All I know is that it puts my mind in a place it likes to be, and that's all that matters. You'd wouldn't think something that smells like a treat you get at the fair would make you feel this good...but it does. \n\nI only spray this twice when I wear it...one on my chest and one on the back of my neck. The performance is legendary without being cloying.", "35": "I work in the medical field in a medical/surgical hospital setting.  Anyone who works with hospital patients will recognize the unique smell of a type of non-occlusive medicated dressing called xeroform.  This, is the scent of xeroform bottled.  Maybe if I had never smelled that extremely distinct smell I would not find this entirely unpleasant?  I still love Francis Kurkdjian but this one is a hard pass for me.", "36": "Wow, so much hate. I don't understand it. Yes it's a unique fragrance, yes it's a beast. Yes it is largely aroma chemicals. That said, it's extremely pleasing scent, the beast mode is mostly in longevity not sillage and the aroma chemicals are very fine. It's expertly blended and though it smells unnatural, it doesn't smell synthetic. That sounds like an oxymoron but it's part of the magic. A lot of people in the frag community are anosmic to it because they spend so much time w their noses in bottles of aroma chemical heavy Parfumes that they can only smell extremely concentrated naturals. That's not the fault of the fragrance.  I don't dismiss anyone's right to their opinion but imho they're just railing against the hype of an expensive, overexposed fragrance. \nTo all those looking for a little less charged review. Mfk Baccarat Rouge 540 is a sweet, bold, musky scent that's very unique and instantly memorable. Fairly linear BUT that's after a looong dry down during which time it will become unique to your skin. I don't know any two people who smell the same after they've worn it for a few hours. I bought it as a gift originally and shopped my sample around to many guinea pigs both male and female and I'd say 70/30% wanted to live in it. Which is good because it does stick to you. Ultra longevity, but sillage becomes somewhat mysterious after a few hours because it is aroma chemical dense. So you might spend an hour in a room and not fill it with the scent but when the air shifts just right a breeze of some layer of it will become apparent. I ended up buying a bottle for myself very recently and really enjoy it as a refreshing change from my more masculine perfumes. It never ceases to grab the attention of people around me and I love the way I catch a breath of it when I'm working up a little heat. \n\nTl:dr All very popular things get hate but they are popular for a reason. BR 540 is no different. Get a sample and make up your own mind.", "37": "I bought this perfume because it was strongly hyped in YouTube. At first I thought this fragrance was too sweet and that I could only wear it during colder months.\n\nI live in a tropical country and it is really hot during summer (like 35\u00b0+ celsius) and I had no intention of wearing this because I commute on my way to work everyday and other people might find this too strong.\n\nOne day, I decided to not give a crap about what other people would think and I put it on with pride. Surprisingly, this works on a hot weather. I'm not sure what it is but I think it has something to do with the pineapple juice sweetness I'm getting on this perfume which is a tropical fruit. It still smells the best on colder days, though.\n\nHonestly, I was not in love when I bought this perfume - I bought it just because. But the more I wear it, the more I love it. I've been using this perfume nonstop for the past 3 months now and my other perfumes are screaming for attention.\n\nContrary to other people who smells nothing but sweetness, on my nose I can smell something woody, salty, and something else but I smell no flowers here.", "38": "This fragrance is hard to pin down. I know that I love it, but I\u2019m not exactly sure why. It\u2019s sweet but its also woody and sparkly. It\u2019s femimine, but totally masculine as well. It light and transparent, but it\u2019s strong as hell. \n\nThis was not a love at first sniff. I thought it was okay, but nothing special. Fast forward about six months and I found my sample buried in my drawer, took a sniff and I was blown away. Ended up going through multiple samples. This fragrance is so wonderful and unique. I get a really nice woody/mineral-like accord, with that sugary sweetness. It smells incredibly expensive and of the highest quality. \n\nThis fragrance is also highly versatile. Due to the price tag I would save this for more dressed up occasions, but I can\u2019t think of an occasion that this wouldn\u2019t work. This can also be worn year round. I\u2019d probably prefer to wear it in more mild temperatures so spring and fall. \n\nPerformance on this is great. It is very transparent, but it is strong enough that it stands out and gets attention. I get so many compliments with this and almost all have been from women.\n\n10/10", "39": "I smelled it at first on paper test at Neiman Marcus I wasn't so impressed. It smelled standard sweet and flat, I can understand the similarity with Cloud. I thought how can this perfume cost that high and so many people rave about it. \nUntil I smell it on my skin, it is very different and not that similar with Cloud anymore. When I spray on my skin at first I thought I was anosmic, I couldn't smell it so much, but wait, 30 minutes later, the smell suddenly appear and oh my gosh, I never smelled anything like this. I don't know how can somebody make this kind of perfume, it is sooo gooodd...it is there but it's not there, other people smell it when you don't, but sometimes you suddenly get a strong but gentle whiff of the scent and it will blow you away. \nI sprayed the sample once on my arm, I sat on the couch, until 3-5 days later, anytime I sit on my couch I still smell the BR540 from my wrist 5 days ago eventhough I didn't rub my wrist on the couch! It tells how strong this perfume can be but it doesn't slap you on your face. The scent is heavenly good, it is airy sweet but not so sweet, it's a little woody, maybe there's some spice that block the sweetness so it's not sickening sweet. Whoever made this perfume, he is a pure genius! It is worth of full bottle for me, you only need 1 spray, it sticks on your skin even after you wash your hand. The lasting power is eternal. \nI sampled the extrait too, they smell pretty much the same, the extrait is more powerfull and deeper, and the lasting power for extrait is more eternal. If you live in colder weather the extrait will be worth it, but I live in very hot weather in AZ so I will go with EDP, the extrait will be too much for me. \n\nPS: So many fakes of this perfume, even worse than fake Chanel, be careful when buying from Ebay. I don't smell anything medicinal or 'dentist office' at all, what I smell is the most luxury and gorgeous perfume that worth of the price tag.", "40": "Although it's considered to be a unisex fragrance, I'd say it's much more feminine than masculine.

It has a very jammy quality that resembles the smell of freshly canned preserves, or even a dark, rich California Zinfandel (a real Zinfandel, not white). \n\nPerformance is off the charts and exceeds even the most potent offerings from Amouage, Nasomatto, and Rioja.

When you first put it on, because of its unapologetic dynamism, you might think it's too sweet, too intense, too peculiar. Of course, it's none of that. The combination simmers down to pure perfection. I've never liked sweet fragrances but I adore this. I had also never found a fragrance that lasts on me until this one- and it lasts until you decide to wash it off at the end of the day.

First of all, you must test this on your skin, testing it on a paper strip will absolutely not give you the true result. Second, you must wait at least an hour before forming your verdict. Initially, after testing it once on my wrist in the store, I was slightly disappointed, I loved the scent but just wanted more! And then wow, it started to really open up. My husband could smell just one spray on me, and my coat jacket still had the beautiful scent on it the next day. My husband loved this so much that he surprised me with it the next day.\n\nThe scent itself does remind me of \"grown-up\" caramel but not cloying or too sweet in any sense. The sweetness is warm and comforting. The drydown is indeed salty (must be the ambergris) and I keep smelling my wrist from time to time.

It's cotton candy without being gourmand. It's strawberry jam but also salty and mineral. It's fruity cola -like Luca Turin stated- without being childish. \n\nWoody notes and ambergris balance its sweetness in a way that makes it relevant for any gender. It's airiness makes it wearable in warmer evenings as well without being out of place when it's not winter or autumn. It lasts the whole day but is never intrusive. There's a transparency to it which is an important element that supports the elegance of the composition and prevents a loud and cloying result. \n\nThe long dry down rewards you with it's mineral saltiness coming to the fore, a perfect end to its woody sweet journey. \n\nBaccarat Rouge 540 is olfactory flair.", "47": "I really didn't know what to expect from this fragrance. I assumed it would be good, because of the popularity, but the notes sound insane. \n\nThe liquid inside my little tester, packs a punch. I dabbed the smallest amount, and it smells like I full on sprayed it. I can FEEL that fresh tree resin smell... in my eyes! Which is a relief, considering how expensive this perfume is. \n\nThe smell... is incredible. Somehow MFK has turned jasmine, amber, wood, and ambergris, into fresh woody caramelized sugar. Like collecting sap from a maple tree, that is growing next to a fresh fir tree, on a beautiful spring day. Addictive. Insanity!\n\nThis is one of the most perfect smells I have ever smelled.

Warm apple pie, straight from the oven. When the pie cools down, you can smell warm woods - almost that sauna smell, mixed with the scents of a christmas fair - wafts of candied apples and caramelized nuts. And open fires? It smells a little bit toasy or burnt, and I mean that in the good way. I don't get dried fruit/grapes/raisin for the cognac at all, only apples. And it's not nearly as boozy as the packaging suggests, but if any I'd say its more calvados than cognac.  \nLovely fragrance, perfect for the autumn and holiday season!

A few weeks ago I was fortunate enough to get a sample of both Angel's Share and Roses on Ice. When I returned home, I sprayed my right hand with Angel's Share and my left with Roses on Ice. Roses on Ice is beautiful but I feel as though it leans more feminine but Angel's Share just blew me away. I could not stop smelling my right hand.  \nAfter about 30 minutes, my mind was made up. I e-mailed the By Kilian specialist at my local Holt Renfrew to put aside a bottle for me as I would only be able to return to the store the next weekend. He replied back and with pleasure, said he would save me a bottle. But it was the last one in stock at any of the Holt Renfrews. He was getting e-mails and calls from other Holt's around Canada, asking him for the bottle he had in stock and he refused, as he had already promised his last bottle to me.  \nSeeing how this is sold out everywhere you look, I'm very thankful and appreciative to him for hiding away the bottle for me. When I went to the store last Saturday to pick up the bottle, he had literally hidden it in the bottom of one of the cupboards of his booth, at the bottom of a shopping bag in which he was storing tester cards, so that no one would find it and sell it when he wasn't at work. He went above and beyond to make sure that bottle was mine and I am thrilled and feel extremely blessed to own it. It is my first By Kilian and to date, the most expensive fragrance in my collection.  \nNow, on to the performance.  \nOn my skin, this stuff is a beast. It radiates a good 5-6 feet away. It leaves an intoxicating scent trail as I walk and it lasts FOREVER. It was my scent of the day yesterday (Friday) and this morning as I am typing this, I am STILL catching wafts of it, although much fainter, over 24 hours after spraying it. In fact, it is actually 27 hours since I first sprayed it on. So, even though it is by far the most expensive perfume in my collection, ($300 CAD for 50ml), a little goes a LONG way, which makes this a much better value than some other perfumes that were much less expensive but last a fraction of the time.  \nI am in love with this fragrance. Boozy, woody, sweet, sexy. It is just absolutely perfect for this time of year. I don't think you could pull this off in the warmer months because the sweetness might get cloying but during the colder parts of fall, spring and definitely throughout the winter, this fragrance will cut through the cold and make a huge impression on everyone around you.  \nIn my opinion, this is an absolute masterpiece. 10/10 fragrance.", "3": "What a day with this fragrance today! I\u2019ve been wearing this for about a month. I had received a few compliments but nothing like today. Received 3 unsolicited compliments. First one I was at state and liberty picking up a suit and the female who was helping me said I smell amazing and I told her what the fragrance was and she looked it up and ordered it right there on the spot. About a half hour later I was returning something at Banana republic and the cashier said he has to know what I\u2019m wearing. He was wearing a mask and was across the counter from me. I couldn\u2019t believe he could smell it with a mask and about five feet from me. The final compliment I was walking into the store and a guy walking behind me said \u201cWhat are you wearing Prada\u201d?

Tonka makes itself known too but, unlike something like Feve Delicieuse where the tonka comes off as plastic-y and overbearing to me, the tonka here plays a much more minor or blended note. \n\nIf you\u2019ve smelled Ambre Narguile or Oajan you definitely get the effect of Angel\u2019s Share but I prefer this to those. Certainly performs like Oajan while having the AN smoothness. \n\nNormally I\u2019m pretty - okay extremely - skeptical of hype, especially youtube hype. Too often I am left confused why a bottle gets huge praise while others get no attention. This time, though, it was instant love and an immediate Selfridges order, since it\u2019s all sold out currently stateside. \n\nLongevity was 12+ hours on my dry skin.

I do detect hints of Single Malt in the drydown however.\n\nIt's almost as if Kilian took the very best qualities of those previously mentioned fragrances and made this. I enjoy the combination, and I can't imagine many disliking it but I must say I'm disappointed that it's not more unique.\n\nI recommend holding off on blind buying if you already own Ambre Narguile, Oajan, Apple Brandy or Single Malt.

It is NOT worth the price. Some fruity tobacco, cinnamon, stewed fruits. Lasted through the evening. There really isn't anything to dislike here, but there also isn't anything worth $200+.", "12": "For anyone that really studies fragrances, some comparisons seem reductive or inaccurate, it's often the subtle differences and not the similarities in a fragrance, (especially your favourite fragrances) which make it what it is.\nSo having said all this Angel's share is slightly derivative of the fragrances it's compared to here, but it's those little differences I just mentioned like it's top notes for example I get a good dose of a sweet orange and oakwood (a particularly good material for boozy effects) it's also more gourmand, with a caramel note.    \n However the ultimate effect of Angel's share renders it redundant because I own Oajan and a refined version of this vibe in Ambre Narguile. Because it does go to that spiced, tobacco, mild cherry which could also be Herod or Tobacco vanille and also the honeyed character of Back to black, the dirty vanilla dried right down even starts to yield licorice facets, maybe Lempika?  \nAgain referential, it's a bit this or a bit that....but perhaps that is what makes this so wildly popular or to use a popular 'Fragcomm' term....'HYPEBEAST'!!!\nI'm so down with the kids.\n( I utter as my son walks 10ft in front of me, pretending not to know me)\n\nThe only reason I'm not on board with this is probably the gourmand focus of the formula & probably the price, the fact that Oajan is a massively louder, more spicy and bombastic, slightly less sickly version of this.\nI really loved the opening of Angel's share and despite being boozy I don't think it captures what I assume is the brief of recreating the Angel's share (Something Sarah McCartney has done recently) and it's objectively quite a nice perfume but I was bored with it after 10 mins to be honest not because it's unpleasant just that large portions of this formula are extremely familiar, not in a bad way...just nah!", "13": "On one of our first trips to France, my husband and I stopped at a little cafe in Beaulieu-sur-Mer and had a prix fixe meal that came with the house's signature tarte tatin.

The caramel syrup was smooth and tangy with the apple, both melting into the flakey crust...the custard so perfect...the cinnamon...\n\nAt Saks recently, the sales girl sprayed Angels Share for me and I swooned, immediately going back to that night in the cafe when my husband and I marvelled at the mastery of the French - the ability to turn the simple into the sublime. It's all there; the apple, the cinnamon, the rich tangy syrup...plus I smell expensive cognac and a hint of tobacco. Later, the tobacco disappears but the syrup and tartness remain along with the booze, and all is mellow and blended and smooth. Gorgeous creation by Kilian.", "14": "My GOD, this is stunning.\n\nBUT BUT BUT you absolutely HAVE to let it settle down before making any final evaluations. When I first sprayed this on me I was put off by the sharpness of the cognac. It made the fragrance smell almost \"off.\" But after walking around with it on me for about 30 minutes it started to settle down into sweet, woody deliciousness. The booziness is still there, but it softens and warms up significantly. My opinion on it shifted 180 degrees in minutes and I couldn\u2019t leave without it. \n\nDefinitely not a blind buy, but if you fall for this fragrance, you\u2019ll fall hard.", "15": "Finally I got a FB of it. My Kilian ambassador invited me to the launch webinar of the liquor line and sent me the samples of them within a week of webinar. I tried and LOVE this Angels Share so I immediately placed the order with my ambassador (5 days from launching) but was already out of stock. I was on the waiting list for weeks and finally received a bottle now.\n\nI love how boozy, dark, sensual it is in a gourmandish way. I don\u2019t really get the vibe of oriental woody in the opening or heart, it is more in the base with the vanilla. The cognac is pretty prominent, which I love the most about it. It is so addictive like other Kilian\u2019s but different. One of the bests from Kilian.\n\nPerformance is great but not superb. 8 hours longevity and great projection after 30 minutes then the projection last at least 4 hours. It\u2019s is different than the other fragrances, its opening project weaker than the heart. Cognac and cinnamon last all the way with the oak starting from the heart. It becomes more woody when the base starting with the presence of cognac, vanilla and oak. \n\nThe presentation is gorgeous. Real crystal bottle and the color of the juice that makes it looks like the cognac in a crystal glass. Although the cap is plastic (heard they did it on purpose to avoid dropping and breaking it), the quality of the plastic cap is too good that looks like the same crystal as the bottle, which you can\u2019t tell the difference by looking at the bottle until you hold the cap. \n\nIt is a 10/10 for me but try first before buying a FB because my sister doesn\u2019t like it as the cognac and cinnamon are too much for her. Perfume scents preferences are very personal. People have different tastes.", "16": "Sweet, boozy, woody vanilla gourmand.

Very gourmand. Absolutely intoxicating. Aptly named. I smell DIVINE. It\u2019s boozy, but like a reduction with brown sugar not just a glass of Cognac. Projection is moderate, sillage is moderate, longevity is decent so far. It\u2019s unisex to me. You could be a very sexy woman wearing this or a well dressed man and I think no one is gonna think it\u2019s masculine or feminine it\u2019s just DELICIOUS and enhances the intrigue factor of the person wearing it. I\u2019m never gonna force a signature scent cause I believe that I\u2019ve gotta vibe with it for quite a while but MAN I hope this is it.\n\nAlso, forgive me if I\u2019m wrong, but cognac is French brandy, dark liquor made with grapes, fruits, and various nuts, and apple notes are often found in cognac. Which if I had to guess is the \u201capple notes\u201d we all smell.", "18": "Sampling one of the latest from By Kilian, Angels\u2019 Share, one of the two new releases of their Liquors collection (along with Roses on Ice).  Angels\u2019 Share is inspired by the phrase that refers to the volume of aging spirits or wine lost due to evaporation during the aging process, and the fragrance is a nod to Kilian Hennessey\u2019s family empire of cognac, specifically, which is the featured note, along with hazelnut and oak, per the house website, though other sources list notes of praline, vanilla, sandalwood, cinnamon, and tonka.\n\nNutty and boozy have to be the most apt two descriptors, but it\u2019s quite sweet but not too sweet, I would argue, and there is a slightly woody base underneath it all, and there\u2019s a vague sharpness that ties the nuttiness to the sweetness and booziness.  And it really feels like a sweet boozy take on cognac rather than, say, whiskey (as in Single Malt), so cognac fans should fined.\n\nI think that some might very well find the sweet/sharp mix to be a little much for their liking, but it\u2019s not among the very sweetest boozy fragrances I\u2019ve smelled, nor is it overwhelmingly nutty.  Still, it leans toward the sweet cognac mostly, followed by the nuts (a mix of hazelnut and tonka is how I\u2019d describe it), and then some woods, for which oak seems right on the money.\n\nAngels\u2019 Share is very nice, roughly on par with Apple Brandy, though still a clear notch below Single Malt in terms of best of the boozy fragrances of the house.  It performs quite well, with very loud projection to start and quite good longevity, equivalent to my experience with most of the darker fragrances in the house.\n\nThe retail pricing of both Angels\u2019 Share and Roses on Ice is somewhat modest (basically as inexpensive as their fragrances get), at $195 for 50ml, but this may very well due to be presentation, which does not seem to include one of the brand\u2019s signature wooden coffrets.\n\n8 out of 10", "19": "This is exactly how the festive season in Hogwarts smells!

As someone that doesn\u2019t classify themselves as a \u201cgourmand\u201d lover, I do like gourmand fragrances when they are done right. And this right here gourmand done RIGHT. It\u2019s one of my favorites from Kilian. \n\nI learned of the meaning of Angel\u2019s Share at the end of last year when I went on a girls trip with my friends. We visited a brewery and the tour guide was telling us about how in the process of fermentation, the portion of the alcohol that is lost due to evaporation is called the Angel\u2019s Share! Isn\u2019t that neat? \n\nThis is a stunning combo of vanilla, tonka, cognac, oak, and cinnamon. Again, nothing else like this is my collection. It\u2019s truly one of a kind. It\u2019s boozy, sweet, spicy, woody, warm, and just DELICIOUS. I wore it to work sometime ago and I just remember this woman in the elevator kept looking in my direction as if she wanted to ask me what I had on. It\u2019s one that fills up a space and evokes boujie coziness. Perfectly unisex. Strong sillage and great longevity. I don\u2019t get the Apple-y vibe that everyone gets but it is reminiscent of a dessert in a pie form.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t like gourmands, this one is worth a try. This is an absolute love for me and will remain a staple in my collection for the colder temperatures.", "21": "Angels' Share was such a surprise to me. I really only spritzed this in a store to see what the Kilian hype was about.

I'm completely enamoured. I smelled that strip, and then I showered myself with the tester and proceeded to be thrilled by how I smelled the entire day. I waited one day and caved to my heart by buying a travel size. I get why some people might see this as an air freshener scent, but that doesn't do it justice. There's certainly an apple pie quality to this, but it's tempered by that smooth, fruity cognac note and a sharp wood. Something a little smoky happens on my skin too, which I love. It's sweet but not cloying, straightforward but with depth. I find the apple cinnamon smell is most evident when you aren't taking a huff directly from your wrist, which is interesting. I don't know where that apple note comes from, but it's very realistic as opposed to what you'd get from, say, an apple candle, and it doesn't dominate. Somehow this scent is even making me enjoy a powdery note, which I generally am pretty opposed to. Just beautifully blended.\n\nA lovely, cozy cool weather scent. Smells like a warm hug. Learn from my mistake and smell it before writing it off, even if you also aren't a big gourmand person.", "22": "Wearing a sample today.  After reading the reviews I was essentially down to just buy it but I tried it on at Saks and it was sadly a no for me.  \n\nOverall a nice boozy fragrance as people have already mentioned.  I don't get \"apple pie\", I get a slightly above average boozy scent.  At times I catch a whiff of MFK Gentle Fluidity Gold, there are similarities to me, probably the vanilla.  I'm kind of glad I don't get the Apple Pie vibe as I feel like Givenchy Pi smells like that and that is not a smell I enjoy.\n\nI feel with Kilian you're mostly paying for packaging.  However, this packaging is a little obvious and I dare say, tacky.  But the fragrance is quality and radiates nicely.  Probably a bit much for grocery shopping, I'll see if I get any funny looks today!\n\nI love Black Phantom but aside from that, I can live without Kilian.  I've stopped checking them out overall.  I had hope for this one and I can definitely see why people like it but it's just not happening for me.\n\nEdit:  The dry down is absolutely disgusting.

As the scent progresses and matures on my skin I cannot help but be reminded of Tom Fords Lost Cherry. Yes it is almost exactly like it!! The finale softens to an exquisite skin scent of sweet cognac with superb silage lasting well into the next day.  Glorious twists and turns.  To me this is a phenomenal blend of my two favorites as mentioned above.  Bravo Kilian! This is beautiful and for once, affordable.  I highly recommend.", "26": "I wore this perfume on 25th of December and I must say it really helped me to set up the festive mood for christmas! I LOOVE this one!! Amazing perfume. Very sophisticated but at the same time so easy to fell in love with it. Packaging is also very beautiful.\nAt first I was sceptic about this one, but the perfume somehow managed to get under my skin. I wish it was more boozy though. I love boozy fragrances and I was expecting little more booziness when i tried it, especially after reading reviews, because many people characterized it as \"very boozy\". It is but just a little bit. I get more of a sweet fruity liquor rather than cognac. It's definitely more on sweet apple cinnamon pie side, but still love this! \nAlso you can smell that Killian DNA in it. I tried LOVE BY KILLIAN before and I'm not saying they're similar but they do share same DNA. (It's my personal opinion though)\nAnd last thing about price... It's definitely a great perfume but still it's a little overpriced.", "27": "How do I express my love for Angel's Share? This is gourmand perfection. To be clear, I am not a general fan of gourmand scents, however-  BATHE ME IN THIS. It's sweet but not cloying, intense but not heavy, and while the cognac in this adds depth and brings down the sweetness, it's not overly boozy by any means. The cinnamon balances out the sweetness of the praline, and the tonka is perfection. \n\nI could see this equally on someone who earnestly loves cinnamon apple pie and wants to smell nostalgic or someone mysterious, fun, and alluring.\n\nA gourmand for all.", "28": "Could anyone please call the Police , because this one stole my heart and I need it back.\nMy #1 smell ever , very boozy, warm and spicy , what a masterpiece.\nThis is the only one fragrance that brought me a compliment from my father, which is enough to make this more valuable to me.\nProjects very well with decent longevity and the smell becomes more interesting when it dries down.\nBtw, did Kilian meet any angels?

On her, she smells like a cinnamon apple pie/ angel cake. My boyfriend ended up really liking it and bought one for himself. On him, he smells like a boozy cinnamon cocktail. It\u2019s just interesting how it performs differently on different skin and works for both sexes. This thing is powerful with longevity and sillage as well, only needing one or two sprays to leave its trail and carry on into the next day. If you like gourmand scents, spices, slight booziness, and high performance, I would approve of blind buying this.", "33": "Jan 2021\n\nOkay, this review is a side by side comparison of Angels Share and Ambre Narguile. Reading all the reviews here, I see that one other person did this comparison (Gelkita). Altho my impressions are slightly different, we both came to the same conclusion: Narguile is just better in most ways.\n\nFirst of all, Narguile by the great Jean Claude Ellena was first. It's also cheaper by the ML, which considering this is a Hermes is really saying something.\n\nHead to head in the opening: I prefer Narguile. \nIn AS, I smell Praline and Cognac. In Narguile, I smell cinnamon apple pie.\n\nIn the mid, I prefer AS since Narguile gets more woody at this point.\n\nIn the drydown, Narguile wins hands down. It's sweeter and more addictive IMO. The drydown is where the two frags smell the most similiar but there is something slightly synthetic there in AS. Maybe it's the sandal?\n\nThey both last more than 10 hrs on my skin but even in the ending, Narguile has better projection. AS's projection is not bad; Narguile is just better. Again.\n\nAS is good. Maybe not $195 for 50Ml good and if you never smelled Narguile. But if you did, Angels Share wouldnt be as overhyped as it is.", "34": "This is an amazing unisex scent, to me it leans more feminine as the dry-down on me is a sweet cinnamon which I love. To be honest I don't get too much of the cognac note, it's very light on me. I've never smelled Ambre Narguile as I don't think it's available where I live (Hong Kong), but this perfume makes me feel so happy, content and cozy I can't even explain it.\n\nRight after buying this perfume, I met up with some friends and told them I splurged on a unisex perfume. The guys were curious and made me spray some on their wrists to test and they couldn't stop smelling their wrists the whole night! Lol so yes, it's even guy approved. The sillage is insane and lasts a good 8-ish hours on my skin.\n\nAddicting, beautiful and well worth it IMO. I feel like this bottle will last me a while.", "35": "My new favorite perfume! I own few Killian perfumes so I was very excited to try out this one as well!\nTo me this smells very expensive!\nIn the beginning you get cognac with cinnamon although I don't necessarily smell cinnamon that much it is very well blended. I also get a little smokiness on me perhaps its the cinnamon. I read below someone mentioned Lost Cherry by Tom Ford and I couldn't agree more, there is a very syrupy boozy cherry in the mid notes that makes this even more incredible. In the dry down I definitely smell the mint notes many mentioned but to me it reminded me of the mint chocolates ''After Eight'' !\n\nIf I could describe this fragrance as a setting to me it would be, winter time by a fireplace in a very luxurious living room drinking cognac and eating mint chocolates lol", "36": "It really is apple pie (one loaded with cinnamon) with a glass of something stiff to wash it down, all without being toothache sweet.

However, wow...I think this is gorgeous. It has aspects of fragrances that are familiar to me yet, this pulls at my heartstrings. It is warm, deep, very decadent. I love this and must purchase a whole bottle. Speaking of the bottle....WOW it\u2019s beautiful. I know that I am a marketer\u2019s dream but yes, it will be mine.", "38": "Tested this upon walking out, having tested at-least 12462882 perfumes (you know until the coffee just doesn\u2019t do the job anymore!) \n\nThen\u2026 \n\nBAM! \n\nA completely different sensory experience, I was so taken back from the first whiff, senses that hadn\u2019t been activated from any other perfume tickled something untouched. I\u2019ve never smelled anything like it, YET it was a smell that took me back to my childhood\u2026how could a perfume I've never smelled before do that? \n\nA warm hug, undeniably a top tier gourmand. So masterfully blended that the other notes just sneak up on you like they\u2019re waiting for you to finish that first hug, then bam a second hug, a third hug\u2026 and then your sense of TASTE is activated? the fourth. (Did I really just smell all that in 4 seconds?) \nWhy am I drooling\u2026\n\n\nUnisex but leaning ever so slightly male. However, this would be a refreshing change from \u2018excessive\u2019 floral perfumes you would usually get from a lovely lady in red. \n\nPricey? Yes.  \n\nWorth it? Depends who you ask. \n\nNo perfume is \u2018blind buy\u2019 worthy, you can\u2019t know how your body chemistry will react to a perfume. \n\nConclusion: I don\u2019t only want to spray it, I want to drink it\u2026so that I could sweat it too, I mean\u2026 it is a glass of cognac right?", "39": "Ahh I can\u2019t stop drooling! \ud83e\udd24 Boozy, thick, opulent \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb The cinnamon is to die for in this!

Strangely, i get a slight shaving foam smell in the dry down which is also really nice and makes it sligtly masculine. Balances the sweetness nicely. The cinnamon is the dominating note all the way. \n(it\u2019s more like a cinnamon stick, not ground cinnamon)\n The fragrance is absolutely beautiful from the opening till the end, it\u2019s a real pleasure to wear! \nPerformance is really good, strong projection and lovely sillage/scent trail for about 4-5 hours then it slowly calms down, but still can smell it and get lovely whiffs of it after 6-7 hours.\nLongevity is over 10 hours. Lasts all day!\nDefinitely recommend it, it\u2019s another great offering from the house, in fact one of the best performer. Worth the price imo.

Then, after some time, it dries down to probably the worst smelling scent I have ever come across. I don't know what it is about this fragrance that makes me dislike this drydown so much, but I feel like the cozy sweetness turns into some weird and awkward rubbery synthetic smell. I also get why some people here get a toothpaste kind of vibe from the drydown. Sillage is more than solid and longevity is way above average (don't know whether that's a good thing, though, since it makes you have to put up with the weird drydown longer than you want to). \nI would recommend everyone not to blind buy this one. Find a way to sample it, see how it develops on your skin and clothes. \nIt's a real bummer to me that I can't love Angels' Share as much as most people here seem to do. I will definitely give it a few more chances and see if I can get used to or even grow to like the drydown as much as the spectacular opening. Will give an update if my feelings towards this scent change.", "43": "Angles\u2019 Share is an absolute gem! The presentation is typical of Kilian. Beautiful and elegant yet unassuming. It\u2019s perfect for what the fragrance is. \nIt opens with a boozy note of the cognac accord and really sets the tone for what the fragrance is. The cinnamon, Tonka and vanilla come next and the fragrance really comes to life. It\u2019s a creamy boozy cinnamon if that makes sense. \nInto the dry down it brings a nutty undertone that really fills out the life of the fragrance. To me on my skins it\u2019s very unique and unlike anything else in my collection. I absolutely love this fragrance! \nThe projection is moderate however the performance of this is impressive. I get about 10 hours and I do not become anosmic to it which is a big plus for me! \nBuy this with confidence and Kilian hit it out of the park!", "44": "Warm, rich, opulent, and unquestionably gourmand. The cognac is front and centre throughout, and manages not to smell cheap like a lot of boozy fragrances. Mixed with the sweet vanilla and praline, and the warm spiciness of the cinnamon, this smells like a boozy dessert. Beautiful, but very gourmand, so make sure you like that if you're thinking of buying this. Angel's Share would go perfectly on a cold night, dressed up in a nice restaurant or upscale bar. For this price, I'd like the cap to be glass though.", "45": "This is so delicious! It reminds me of walking through a mall, smelling the Cinnabon and the perfumes coming from Macy\u2019s. So boozy, cozy, amazing. I can see why it\u2019s so popular. Perfect as a date scent. Quickly has overtaken Jazz Club as my favorite boozy perfume. Performance is fantastic. \n\n9.5/10", "46": "2021 batch (purchased direct from By Kilian) - owned and worn since October, 2021.\n\n50ml/$170 (with discount)\n\nI want to address comparisons to Parfums de Marly's Oajan, but I will save that for the end. First the review. Sprayed on skin.\n\nAngels' Share opens up - from the very top of the first spray - with a gorgeous, vibrant, shimmering cognac note. When they say cognac is a \"top note\", they aren't kidding. While a cognac accord remains throughout most of the wear, the photorealistic, French white oak cask-aged boozy cognac note, complete with barrel sediment and all - screams upon application, and then quickly settles and gives way to the heart in a matter of minutes. At this point, we have bourbon vanilla, Ceylon cinnamon, warm, luscious Amber, and praline. The praline is less about chocolate (I get very little, save for perhaps a whisper of very light, milky Swiss cocoa), and more about the caramel/dulce de leche, nutty hazelnut-like creamy filling. These sweet, gourmand aspects slowly push the cinnamon back, lending some more balance. \n\nAs it wears on, the sweetness remains steadfast, but the cinnamon slowly, and gently steps back, allowing some of the woodier base accords to unfurl - oak, perhaps, but certainly a subtle creamy sandalwood component - playing well with the sweetness, but lending some dryness as well. From start-to-finish, you get a cinnamon-dominant, sweet, creamy, festive spicy warm, but decidedly NOT dark experience, that lasts every bit of 8 hours minimum, with noticeable projection for at least half that. Under the right conditions, it will remain as a skin scent for at least 14 hours. On clothing, heavy applications will last until washed. Weeks. \n\nThere are some \"ghost notes\" here. One could easily mistake a subtle tobacco accord, or perhaps honey, dark fruits, and spices. Personally, in the mid, I detect a whiff of jasmine and sweet orange, as well as a fair amount of ambroxan, which definitely aids in the projection and bombastic nature. \n\nYes, Angels' Share leans a bit into the more synthetic territory, although the naturals - especially in the opening, are apparent. Fairly linear. Nevertheless, I personally feel as though, while not ground-breaking, it serves a purpose that no other fragrance can quite substitute, and therefore, is worthy of the hype. It's a festive, boozy, Autumn/Christmas-in-a-bottle with nuclear performance, and seething with warm, cozy, comforting sex appeal. \n\nDoes it smell like apple pie? There's certainly some fruity materials used, which aid in providing lift and brightness, and I can sort of make out some fresh green apple, although I think much of it is the sweet, festive, cozy, gourmand cinnamon notes pushing that association. But yeah - it has an \"apple pie\" vibe. Just don't forget about the cognac/vanilla/amber structure.\n\nIs it similar to Oajan? Shockingly, so many people say \"yes\". I own full bottles of each, and while I initially thought so in the sampling phase, I really can't connect the two now, even side-by-side. They're both cinnamon-centric sweet autumnal scents. That's it. Oajan is much more cinnamon-forward (dry cinnamon), with a darker resinous, almost Middle Eastern flare. It has a bready pastry note that this lacks, and the osmanthus, artimesia, and labdanum give it more of a natural feel. October. Apple pie. Not more than 40-50% similar to each other. The cognac, oak, and praline really make Angels' Share entirely unique. I'd wear Angels' Share formally/dressed up, as it has an air of luxury and class. Oajan I wear while hiking through the New England autumn foliage in October. Would never dress it up.\n\nAll-in-all, Angels' Share by Kilian is a true \"love\" for me. It's nuclear, it's elegant, refined, and while it means synthetic, it's ultra-modern, 100% unisex, and takes the second most beautiful cognac note I've smelled, and sits it atop one of the most fitting festive fragrances to wear through the autumn season, which provides an olfactory soundtrack that truly elevates even the most mundane tasks. \n\nBlind buy safe? Yes - IF you know you enjoy sweet cinnamon/\"apple pie\"/gourmand vanillic ambers that lean neither masculine nor feminine. Please sample first anyway, as this one isn't cheap. \n\nVersatility: LOW - Perfect for late autumn and great through winter. Casual, formal, and date/intimate setting appropriate. It's loud, so if using at work or on a date, go light, because you can and will choke out a room with this. Clubbing certified. Come spring, shelve it.\n\nPerformance: Nuclear. Great longevity and massive projection for half the wear. Zero complaints. Be aware.\n\nQuality: High. Despite a predominantly synthetic structure, it smells luxurious, expensive, and quality, with a unique flare from the cognac. It's not a Slumberhouse, but it's certainly \"niche-quality\".\n\nPrice: $190/50ml retail. $160ish private.\n\nAtomizer: Decent. Fairly wide spray, but nothing special. \n\nGender: 50/50", "47": "I cannot stop constantly sniffing this. I keep saying out loud to myself, \"this is the best smell I've ever smelled.\" I want to shout it from the mountaintops!\n\nFor years I've been trying to find a fall/winter fragrance, but after trying many of the usual suspects, nothing ever feels like \"me\" enough. \n\nThe opening reminds me of fall/wintertime evening around a fire with a boozy cocktail. The dry down reminds me of dessert time at a holiday family dinner. Yes, it smells like apple pie, but in a smoky, boozy way. It is just magical. It is absolutely not too sweet for me, and I am not generally into gourmands. The smokiness and boozy-ness offset the sweetness just perfectly.\n\nThis lasts on my clothes and my body an entire day. If I spray it in the evening, I still smell it in the morning. If I drive my car while I have it on, the next time I drive my car I can smell it lingering in there. It's just heavenly every time I smell it, I can't get enough!", "48": "First impression: liquor or skunky beer. \n\nSlightly sour and off-putting like stale beer in a crushed can you find lying around after a party, and accidentally spill it while you're throwing it away. \n\nI smelled Fan Your Flames yesterday and I thought the liquor in that was done better than this. \n\nI still have more testing to do but so far I'm not impressed with this. \n\nLot's of hype on this one but so far I give it a 3/10.", "49": "I was kind of hoping I wouldn\u2019t like this since I don\u2019t like spending a whole bunch on one fragrance but of course this had to smell absolutely amazing on me.

I don\u2019t get too much of the tonka bean, all the other notes are blended so well it can be hard to point out if I\u2019m smelling sandalwood or oak lol. The cinnamon and cognac are the most prominent notes on my skin though.

This being said, I'd like to briefly talk about a tangential issue concerning this fragrance, which is the following: \ntobacco (eng.) vanille (fr.) \nWhat am I to make of this? How do I pronounce it? Switching accents halfway through is inadvisable, since even my friends from Nouvelle-Orl\u00e9ans choke on their Diet Coke whenever I correctly pronounce \"Guerlain\" in the middle of an English sentence. No, you have to commit to one only.  \nMy first option is, then, to leave \"vanille\" as it's supposed to be (French) and say the English word \"tobacco\" with an exaggerated Jean-Reno-style accent. However, I find it cumbersome to lug around the silk b\u00e9ret and fake moustache which are necessary to channel the appropriate level of pretentiousness. \nAlternatively, you can follow TF's marketing and pronounce the whole thing in English - like a clueless American tourist clutching his phrase book in a Parisian caf\u00e9 (\"Oooh ay le Starbucks?\"), blissfully unaware of the savage beating the waiter is fantasising about behind his smile. \nPerhaps this is all some grand \u0153uvre de trollage - Mr. Ford snickering into his computer screen as he watches reviewers humiliate themselves trying to pronounce his fragrance names. If that's the intent though, I suggest he take a page out of Herm\u00e8s' book and go all out.

I don\u00b4t want to be much personal, just sincere - because this is the scent of my love & our home.  \nFor me, there is something very familiar about this perfume. It reminds me of my life, my memories, my man. All the cigarettes he smoked while he was listening to my stories. Fluffy vanilla latte on Sunday mornings, the taste of Old English dark fruit cake that I have been baking every Christmas. Hennessy cognac for goodnight /while we were listening to our favorite song - Change Is Gonna Come/. \nSweet home, sweet times.  \nTobacco, cigarette smoke, cigar ash, delicately sweet vanilla, dried fruits, cloves, cinnamon - that\u00b4s what I love, what I want, what I need.

It is a gift to myself.\"\nShe takes a brief moment to smile as I maintain eye contact.\n\"The best kind! would you like me to wrap it for you?\"\n\"No. Give it! it is to be enjoyed right away.\" I said to the amusement of the Sephora-Plage representative of Saint Tropez, all the while sampling this eau de parfum on my wrist, then on my chest, opening the collar of my dress shirt as she was seemingly leaning forward. \nTobacco Vanille unexpectedly took me back to a very private place, where laughter was cheap and colours saturated. I used to be on the Right at the time and perhaps a bit emotionally disconnected, and \"She\" was on the other far-end of the political spectrum. Beautiful, strong, opinionated and witty. Naturally we clashed\u2014Genevieve called me an Imperialist and I called her a child\u2014she stormed out of the debate and I followed ... but before we could understand what had taken hold over us, here we were, lustfully rolling in the grass of our University. She used to perfume herself with nothing but vanilla extract while I reeked of those Davidoff cigarillos I favour to this day... \nBut the real Tobacco Vanille is far more eloquent. Yet it is an idea refined to its simplest and purest form like the most accomplished architectural projects. This eau de parfum is a opulent Niche caprice. It is a manly unsmoked pipe tobacco\u2014It's tin is flavoured with cloves, anise and wood sap that sensually tango with a moist and candid Bourbon vanilla, a creamy tonka bean and what must be Criollo (a very high quality cocoa that represents less than 3% of the world's production) imported straight from madagascar\u2014There is also a very playful note which echoes the smell of a little Grand Marnier spilled on an old leather sofa and expands further the underlying theme of the old Gentleman's Club so cherished by Tom Ford. Tobacco Vanille is a simple way of saying very elaborate things.  \n...Genevieve and I would soon abandon our ambitions and made plans to elope to the complete dismay of our respective comrades, but tragedy would decide otherwise (To those of you who have known this kind of quiet rage and survived it, I salute you.). \n\"Magnifique!\" Back in Saint Tropez, the Sephora representative had just woken me from my memoria loci, studying me with those dark almond shaped eyes and nervously playing with the tip of her tight, tight ponytail (...).

But then it rounds itself out into a mature vanilla & sweet tobacco scent, along with something else, maybe licorice.\n\nIt's sexy, dark, and daring for a woman. Oh yes! But I think that's what makes it so intriguing. I know a man can wear this also, and I definitely hope they would, but I would almost prefer to smell it on a female... a femme fatale.

As a vanilla/gourmand devotee who is trying to build a more serious fragrance collection, some of the higher end fragrance houses can be intimidating.

I couldn't take my nose from my wrist. With time, the scent evolved into a more robust and sweet fragrance, like a beautifully blended whiskey and a splash of Coke with a glossy, honeyed finish. Tobacco Vanille is simultaneously inviting and bold. I think I would loving smelling this on my SO just as much as I love wearing it.

The vanilla is beautiful, and of a high quality; sweet yet also quite natural. The tobacco is the spicy, clovey type and reminiscent of smells one typically associates with the holidays. TV has very good projection and longevity, though it does not develop or change much throughout the life of the scent. It is probably most appropriate for night-time wear, or a day spent out and about. TV is a fairly heavy scent, but works fine when applied moderately. \n\n If you're looking for a something sweet to wear in the fall or winter, don't pass this one up! It's one of the best gourmands out there.", "14": "Tobacco Vanille is supposed to be a unisex fragrance, but I honestly don't care much for it on myself, its just a little too dense and sweet on a man. On my wife however it smells absolutely phenomenal. and has become her favorite fall/ winter scent. It smells like a fruity hookah smoke with a vanilla tobacco attar about it. Nuclear performance all around lasting easily 12+ hours on her skin with just a spray or two. I know it's been reformulated but she doesn't care, her bottle is from 2016 and it lasts and smells just fine to my nose. This has got to be the absolute sexiest cold weather fragrance on a woman that I've ever come across.", "15": "I absolutely love this fragrance. A complete masterpiece in my opinion!\n\nJust making things short: honey, vanilla and tobacco never were so good on my skin, and this combination stays and projects forever!\n\nA MUST TRY for anyone who loves sweet fragrances.", "16": "First perfume that ever took me by storm. \n\nOne sniff and it still makes me imagine an old library furnished with only heavy, dark pieces of massive wood. The room is lit only by candle light. An intelligent man with dark hair and a salt and pepper beard sits in the leather chair next to me, he cuts a cigar but doesn't light it yet. He crushes the discarded flakes of tobacco between his fingers. He sits so close to me that I can almost detect the smell of the after mint on his breath. \n\nThe vanilla of the scent isn't materialized in this instant image, but it kind of wraps the entire scene and sensation of the scent in a cloak of comfort and security. Nothing dangerous can happen, but something exciting will.", "17": "This is amazing.\nOpens up with glorious daddy issues of pipe tobacco and bourbon, then dresses in a chocolate velvet vest with a watch chain and takes me out to the lesbian billiards bar. I drink vanilla shots until I'm cut off for spilling one and we go home to empty cabinets except for that fruitcake I re-gifted and got back two years later. It's delicious.\nBest date ever.", "18": "I love it. I want to bathe in it. Buying it as we speak.\n\nI smell like a teabag + vanilla for hours upon hours. It's great. Utterly wearable. Not too sweet.\n\nI also own Tihota and now feel like I have all my bases covered. Vanilla-wise, that is.\n\nEdit: The real \"Fucking Fabulous\".\n\nEdit: Haha, no, Vanilla-wise I do not have all my bases covered. So naive, lol. One can never have too many vanilla perfumes.", "19": "No fragrance takes me somewhere else like this. I spray it, and I'm suddenly of \"old money\" in a swanky cigar lounge in London in Fall. I've only been to London once to date, but this one screams classy Brit to me. It's also so cozy that if you're spinning a rainy weekend at home, I can think of nothing better to spritz. The vanilla is subdued, and the tobacco is somewhat clean; nothing dirty about it.\n\nIt's handsome; it's pretty. After putting it on, you can see why Tom Ford fragrances became so sought after. Most of the remaining collection doesn't compete with how moving this release was. People starting to get into high-end fragrances should look to this first. The new 10 mL travel bottles with magnetic caps are priced somewhat reasonably since you'll used it so sparingly because it's so potent--both in longevity in sillage.\n\n10/10 delicious scent, 10/10 longevity, 10/10 sillage. True masterpiece that's a must-have for any collection, big or small.", "20": "Probably the biggest compliment getter in my collection. I would never have guessed it would be since the tobacco and spicy notes definitely are noticeable, and not usually \"easy\" or mass appealing. In the dry down however, they get a little bit pushed to the side by the vanilla and that's usually about the time when people compliment me on my scent. It lasts an enormous amount of time and projects very nicely without being offensive. I would be  a little cautious with wearing it in hot weather, although I have to admit, I have and didn't get any complaints. A beautiful nighttime scent, especially great for cozy scenarios during the fall and winter. Also, a perfect unisex scent that I love to share with my boyfriend. I highly recommend it!", "21": "This is the first Tom Ford fragrance I have fallen in love with to the point of needing to buy it for myself.  I'm so glad I own this one, because it's beautiful.\n\nThis fragrance is very straightforward, and Tobacco Vanille is a very accurate name.  Basically, this perfume is a beautiful mix of pipe tobacco and vanilla cake. It's very yummy and sophisticated at the same time. I think that the spicy notes add an almost cinnamon-like characteristic to the perfume as well, which really warms up the fragrance to the point where I view it as a Fall and Winter perfume.  The cacao and tonka bean, I think, really add to the vanilla to the point of making it smell like a piece of cake rather than just vanilla extract (if that makes sense). I pick up on an almost \"eggnog\"-like vibe to this ... A boozy, nutty, and cinnamon-y vanilla.  If you love eggnog like I do, then this perfume is definitely worth checking out.  This is going to become a favorite Christmas/Holiday scent for me for sure.\n\nLike all Tom Ford fragrances, the sillage and the duration of the perfume are crazy-impressive.  All you need is one spray, in my opinion.  I think this fragrance smells best when you approach it with a \"less is more\" mentality. This is a fragrance where you want people to smell it when they're close to you, in my opinion.\n\nFor me personally, I find this fragrance to be very sexy and cozy. This is something I will wear for date night and cocktail parties.  I also think this is a fantastic unisex fragrance ... It has the perfect combination of masculine and feminine.", "22": "My first full-sized bottle from TF and what a great choice. It's stunning, opulent, seductive, loud. Everything I want my perfume to be. If you're looking for boozy, tobacco, vanilla, spicy, fruity scent with a lot of character - look no more.", "23": "This scent. Words fail me. Love at first whiff for my husband and I. I've never had a scent that is always a good choice for every season, every occasion. Even for work (with very picky co-workers) and casual wear. Amazing and complex in every way.\n\nWhen I was a child, there was a used book store in a hundred year old store front that sold my Dad's favorite pipe tobacco in bulk. There were several apothecary style glass jars filled with fruity, boozy, and vanilla scented tobaccos that mixed and mingled with the old leather of chairs and books and the pot of coffee in the corner. That is what this scent smells like. Old money that is quietly content with the simpler things in life and is in no way ostentatious or gauche. Perfection.", "24": "So I finally got around to try this little rascal, and this guy has attitude! To me Tobacco Vanille introduced itself like a delicious explosion of vanilla rum, tobacco, smoke from a fireplace, myrrh, cinnamon, raisins and a mix of various dried berries (not considering the actual notes in it here, just what it instantly smelt like to me). As it dries down it strongly reminds me of a Norwegian drink we have during Christmas time, called \"gl\u00f8gg\", similar to the German/Austrian \"Gl\u00fchwein\" (hot wine/mulled wine). It was not at all what I expected, but it's very well done imo. It was quite a surprise to my nose and it instantly brought me to Christmas time with my family, snuggling up in front of the fireplace all happy, satisfied and calm after a heavy Christmas dinner. \n\nI like it because it smells good and because it brings me that particular memory of a special time of the year, but it's not something I'm able to wear as a perfume. For that it's way to heavy/dark/different to me. But I wouldn't mind having a spritz of it from time to time, even though I won't be buying a bottle of it. But really, I think everyone has to try this on once, just because it's so special and different.", "25": "If you're looking for an overly complex scent that changes from top notes to dry down, Tobacco Vanille is not for you. However if you're wanting the best rendition of something simple, TV is one of the best out there. The tobacco is exotic and comforting rather than dry and off-putting, and the vanilla isn't so sweet as to make you feel like you just rubbed a cupcake on your arm. However the blend overall is sweet enough that I can't imagine it on a man. Sillage can be quite strong so dab rather than spray if you can, and longevity is superb at 6 hours and counting.\n\nHowever, for all its beauty Tobacco Vanille is horribly overpriced. I don't mind paying top dollar for the well-blended, complex, and long-lived, but a blend this linear needs to have a good chunk knocked off the price. $120 or $140 would be tempting, but at nearly $200 for 50ml TV is the kind of scent I'll pine for but never buy unless $200 somehow dropped onto my lap.", "26": "Tobacco Vanille, an enticingly warm and intense fragrance that intensifies as your body heat increases.\n\nA seductive and comforting fragrance reminiscent to the aroma of marshmallows dipped in warm chocolate & vanilla. \n\nit starts of with a trio of cocoa, vanilla & dried fruits to create a harmony of warmth with vanille undertones.\n\nthe Cocoa & vanilla stay as notes of creamy marshmallow comes out to intensify the sensuality and passion of the fragrance.\n\nthe fragrance is balanced by the smoky tones of tobacco leaf & tobacco flower to keep it from becoming to sweet. \n\nOverall if you like the smell of toasted chocolaty marshmallows infused and heightened by the seductive tones of vanilla & tobacco, you will love this one\n\nA very private creation, turned down the light and the warmth & gourmand notes of this fragrance should enhance any couples mood throughout the night and leave it's warm impression the morning after ;-)", "27": "At work today (I work at a perfume store) I was helping a gentlemen and kept getting whiffs of a delectable sweet vanilla...it confused me as I was on the mens side. He began talking about what he wants in a fragrance and motioned for me to smell his neck, I leaned in and WOW !!!! AMAZING! It completely blew me away! In my 9.5 years working here I've never been able to smell someone's cologne over all the other smells in the store. This stuff is expensive and rightfully so, it carries very well. Maybe one day I'll get my hands on a sample of this. It's PERFECT for the colder weather.\nI regret not smelling his neck one more time :(", "28": "Think of Tobacco Vanille as a machine. A very specific machine that does nothing else beside mass producing Compliments. \n\nNow you know what it smells like.", "29": "I got a decant of this. This is what I want Spicebomb to be.\n\nImmediately, I get wet, boozy, rum-soaked pipe tobacco, then vanilla (slowly). Dry spices--cinnamon and clove, mostly--roll out like curls of smoke after half an hour or so. After another thirty minutes, I start to smell this jammy/fruitcake note. It reminds me of sweet port. Then, it goes back to tobacco and kind of starts over again. This is full of liquor. Wearing this makes me feel like I'm having a stiff, thick drink in an incredibly nice library. I really like this.\n\nThe problem I have with this (as a graduate student) is that I can't think of any \"real life\" situation for wearing it--haha, or affording a real bottle, for that matter.", "30": "Enormous Silage & Great longevity.\n\nThis is a smoky vanilla scent, not gourmand.\nI don't know why I always thinking of HONEY when I was wearing it.\nUnisex but a bit feminine.\nThis is a tobacco scent that women can wear it without doubt.\nI bought 100ml in 2007 first release. \nIt's warm, sophisticated & wearable all seasons.\nIt lasts all day.(HUGE++)\n\nUNIQUE scent.\nLove it!\nMy favorite from TF.", "31": "I can't believe this took me so long to test out, but I'm so glad I got around to this one.\n\nThere is something unidentifiable, yet familiar about this fragrance. It kept evolving, and reminded me of different things and experiences in my life. I kid you not, my first experience wearing this scent consisted of me sniffing my wrist compulsively thinking, \"Oooh! Cinnamon buns? Dried cloves? Spice markets? Chai tea? Cinnamon sticks? Antique furniture? The holiday season? Spiced eggnog? Sweet tobacco? Incense sticks? No, that can't be it..\" It actually seemed like this was an extension and reminder of all of my fondest memories and the memorable smells that went along with them! \n\nTobacco Vanille is very warm and comforting in a unique way. It has just enough sweetness to balance out the dry tobacco, without being cloying. It kept me entranced and above all, interested in what I would think of next; this was a journey in a bottle for me. \n\nIf it's any consolation or help to anyone, I'm a female in my early 20s and I love the way this smells on my skin, but I would love it equally as much on my man. A smell like this has no gender or limitations.", "32": "When I first smelled Tobacco Vanille it was love at first smell. I initially walked into the boutique in my area just to get an idea of what Tom Ford had to offer. I had heard the reputation of this particular scent, but was a little nervous about the idea of wearing something too smoky. I was able to pick up a sample of it and couldn\u2019t put it down. I found myself smelling my wrist throughout the day. It\u2019s addictive.\nAt first the tobacco note is a bit more noticeable on my skin; but it\u2019s not like a fiery smoke \u2013 more like a cooking smoke \u2013 at least on me. On myself, the smoke wears down and I am left with a spicy vanilla. To me, it smells like a sophisticated sweet fragrance. It\u2019s not a sickly sweet by any means.\nThis lasts on me for hours, and even when it\u2019s onto hour eight or so, it is still close to my skin and is just wonderfully cozy. It\u2019s certainly my most complimented fragrance from both men and women. Despite owning so many other scents, I would go as far as to say this is my favorite \u2013 at least for now.", "33": "Ohhhh Tobacco Vanille, you make me swoon. This is one of my favorite fragrances to smell on a man during the winter. I have worn it on myself as well, but it is the type of smell that I want my partner to wear when things get hot and heavy. The scent of the expensive, unsmoked cigar and the decadent chocolate and vanilla are beautifully blended. There are so many tobacco fragrances on the market right now, but none of them makes me weak in the knees like this one.", "34": "Just got my Tobacco Vanille! It is a 100ml blind buy as I only purchased it because of the notes in it.\nAnd....\n\nIt is heavenly! So yummy and scrumptious I can't get enough of it!\nIt lasts for hours after just one spritz, and the smell just gets better with every second.\n\nI'm so glad I bought it! Highly recommended for lovers of quality sweet perfumes. You are sure to delight in this one.", "35": "Many people say they can't find an occasion to wear this scent. That's because it should be worn by rich people that dress well, that have a rich environment and don't think too much about the scent itself, like normal people would put some generic CK on. I bet Tom Ford himself would even wear this during high heat and couldn't care less about anyone's opinion", "36": "Sex in a bottle... I love the smell of a Gentlemen\u2019s Club.. this envelopes me in dark wood, maroon, cigar smoke, bourbon, expensive colognes, \nThis is the essence of this blend. I can\u2019t pull a single note out, I smell them all at once.\nIt\u2019s sexy, It\u2019s a smell you hope to find on someone you want to know better although the olfactory is said to have drawn us already, we\u2019re greedy & want more..  imho... this is definitely one of the mores..\nLight of hand.", "37": "This right here, has to be one of the top ten greatest fragrances ive had the pleasure of having my nose on.

Move on to someone who understands this whole situation. Good God!", "38": "Wife bought me a bottle of this for Christmas back in 2010. I went through an entire bottle in one year and wife bought me a bigger bottle for Christmas in 2011. I wore it sparingly since then because I wore so much of it so it wasn't anything special anymore....so I moved on to other fragrances. \n\nMy wife surprised me today for my birthday with a new bottle of it because she thought I had run out of it and she said she missed the smell.....I didn't tell her I still had a lot left! I sprayed it on the back of my hand and wow.....huge difference from the old version! Her words...\"Eew....is that what you used to wear\"? \n\nToo much vanilla on top. I let it dry down for an hour to get a better read of it but the vanilla is still dominant. I can smell a hint of tobacco but the vanilla is still very dominant after an entire day at work.\n\nFound the old bottle of TV and sprayed it on the back of my hand....still a masterpiece. Very smooth and still has that tobacco/vanilla vibe that isn't overpowering and still has a bit of smokiness to it that I remembered.\n\nI'm bummed it's changed to what it is currently. I want to start wearing it again but am afraid that once it's gone, I'll never be able to find an old bottle. Bummer.", "39": "I finally received a sample of this through a swap and then bought a small bottle. I did not know I needed it until I had it. This is AMAZING! I wasn't convinced I'd like it because of the tobacco, but it's rich, thick, smokey vanilla with hints of cherry in the background. Those who mentioned Michael's around Christmas time, yasss! That scent, elevated!\n\nIt also reminded me of sitting in a lounge in an upscale Caribbean resort, wearing a vanilla scent, sipping on a fruity drink, while a couple people are smoking cigars somewhere around.", "40": "Good god, Tom Ford is going to be the death of me. I don't know what is happening with my nose. I have always favored sweet gourmands, but I fell madly in love with Black Orchid a year ago. I didn't realize at the time that it would turn out to be a gateway scent into Tom Ford's entire collection. I ordered several decants of his private blend, and the teeniest one was a 1/2 ml of this scent. I am in awe. \nTobacco vanille is stroll down a bustling sidewalk when a surprise whiff of an elegant cigar shop stops you in your tracks. It is most assuredly tobacco, on a bed of vanilla with honeyed sweetness. This scent nearly has me trembling.  I am not sure how Tom Ford does what he does. How his scents are simultaneously warm yet aloof, sweet yet earthy, clean yet deliciously dirty. Sex after a shower. Provocative, alluring, and narcotic.\nUltimately, I realized that this scent brought back wonderful memories of times with friends. Long philosophy filled nights where rich cigars and clove cigarettes were smoked over glasses of scotch. The room tense with high ideals, thick smoke, and flirtation. Mystical nights, forever embedded in my memories. Any scent that can bottle that, I must own. I adore this scent.", "41": "Great news...I put Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille on at 4:30pm yesterday, and it's still going!  So glad I found one with good lasting power.  (Black Violet and Oud Wood were excellent and I loved them but they disappeared too quickly)\n\nFirst of all, you really have to be a lover of vanilla in a scent (I am).  Because the scent, to me was pure tobacco and vanilla.  First blast, they came out together loud and very clear, with some wood smell in the background.\n\nThat's pretty much what this scent is all about.  The blend is superb; an excellent smooth tobacco and vanilla.\n\nSecond phase, the vanilla really shines (that's why I say you have to like vanilla), and the tobacco takes a back seat for a while, but it's still a heavenly blend.\n\nDry down is tobacco and vanilla but very creamy, closer to skin but still projecting after 6-7 hours!  Went to sleep, woke up into that wonderful scent still going pretty strong.\n\nThis one is a definite buy for me, because I love the fragrance and it's long lasting.  That is one of the things I insist on in a fragrance, because I wear them for me, I want to smell them all day...they're aroma therapy for me.  Felt very open and proud wearing Tobacco Vanille.  Superb!", "42": "This was a gift from my wonderful perfume addict Grandmother and she should be on here making perfume recommendations, as she always knows exactly what I will love. Unfortunately, she refuses to use a computer so I will try to describe this one as best as possible for you. \nTo me, it smells like a cigar shop, where all the walls and floors are made of cherry wood and there are vanilla candles burning all over the shop. It does not smell like a lit cigar, or an old pipe, or an unlit cigarette, or a smokey bar...it smells like the classiest cigar shop that sells only the most coveted, high-end cigars - in fact, they roll them there since I smell what is more like raw tobacco as opposed to tobacco when it is rolled up into a leaf or paper. \nThere is something very comforting about this scent and there are nuances of cherry and spices, perhaps nutmeg in the background, although I think these are the tobacco and tonka bean. \nThe combination of vanilla and tonka bean always create something magical for me, but when you add that tobacco in, it's truly heavenly. \nVery Tom Ford, very expensive, probably not something I would have splurged on but I'm glad that my grandmother got me a bottle. \nFor the record, this smells totally different on my husband. It's very distinguishing and not as sweet on him; more spicy. The vanilla really comes through on me but the spices make more of an appearance on his skin. We could totally share this, but we don't. It's mine :)", "43": "I have never smoked. But have always loved the scent of a good sweet cigar.\n\nTobacco Vanilla starts out like that perfectly.

I was not expecting the pleasantness of the smell. The tobacco mixed with the sweet vanilla, just omg, SUPERB! I see a lot of reviews saying it's only for the mature, but I think it may work out on young adults too. It's absolutely captivating and seductive, it really spells out confidence as well as it charms. The dry-down of the scent is just as good.

This time I used one spray on my hand and stuck my nose in. It was as if I had smelt something completely different the night prior. The warmest, sweetest and richest vanilla note I had ever smelt hit me, followed by a warm, cozy tobacco note. I instantly fell in love with the scent and praised myself immensely for being so smart to blind buy a bottle of such quality!\n\nTo make matters even better, my wife smelt it and fell in love with it (my wife enjoying a fragrance automatically gives it a positive in my books. Her compliments are the only ones that truly matter at the end of the day).

I love the warmth it brings and the stickiness in the air. I don't think I've ever enjoyed wearing a scent as much as I have enjoyed wearing TV. It's a masterpiece of perfumery.

She is in her sixties and last year she was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer, which has spread to her liver and lungs. She is still battling this awful enemy - let's hope she wins! As a consequence of the chemo and other therapies that she is receiving, she has developed some ulcers and had to give up on drinking coffee; moreover, most of her old perfumes now make her feel nauseated. Fortunately I found Black Opium for her, which satisfies her coffee cravings and doesn't irritate her nose. In her younger days she used to wear the original Opium, which was a beast; however, its present day incarnations, including the Black Opium, are much less powerful. I usually complain about the fact that most contemporary perfumes are watered down versions of the old ones; but, as we can see, in certain cases a softer scent is actually preferable.", "3": "Black Opium - Enjoyable for those who like cream in their coffee.  \nThere are two types of people when it comes to coffee enthusiasts:  \nThe first cares about notes, purity, sourcing, and the process. They are most likely to purchase premium beans from roasters or go the extra mile to order pour over at a reputable coffee house. They are excited for the intricacy and drink their coffee black to savor it in its glory.  \nThe second is just enthusiastic about enjoying a nice cup of joe. They have no special caveats, only a craving for something caffeinated and cozy. They find that adding a splash of cream and maybe even sugar only makes the experience more enjoyable. High end cafe or folgers at a friend's house, they can take pleasure in it.  \nBlack Opium is for the latter person, and I am that kind of coffee drinker! I enjoy coffee of all types, and in that sense, I am not asking Black Opium to be more than it is. I can enjoy it at face value while others scoff at it or wish it was more reminiscent of Opium.  \nUpon initial spray, I get a mellow coffee, straight coffee but hints of non-evasive flowers. Then the scent opens up and all at once, I feel a splash of sweet flavored vanilla creamer swirl in. I get the slightest tart of cherry, much like cherry tart notes in coffee. Very subtle, but it adds a little complexity. The dry down is very gourmand vanilla with slight stickiness, kind of like when a bit of creamer settles to the bottom and the last few sips are very coffee candy with less floral presence, but it lays close to the skin so it isn't offensive. \nIt's evoking but cozy, playful and bright, but not brash -just how I like my coffee.", "4": "I am in love with this scent!!. I found it at the UK's duty free some days ago.\nIs really a unique fragrance, outstanding, very very contrasted from regular Opium or Belle, could be named differently.\nThe coffee note is well blended with the vanilla, making it soo beautiful and alluring!.\nI can notice the floral notes in the middle stage, which are very attractive and gives an interesting twist, is a real complex scent. \nIs very feminine, a modern vision (but keeping the brand's soign\u00e9), also elegant, with personality, the pleasant coffee mixed with florals compose this distinctive womanly aura.\nLasting power is good, You can feel it for a long without being overpowering, can be wear all time.\nVery YSL!!.", "5": "Let me start off by saying I am way late for the \"Black Opium\" train. \nI didn't buy a bottle of this earlier on for...some unknown reason. \n\nSweet baby Jesus - this is delicious!\nIt helps that coffee is my addiction of choice, and one I don't intend to follow any 12-Step program to overcome.\n\nOn first spray, you get a tiny bit of fresh pear. It's really very sweet and uplifting - similar to the original \"Jimmy Choo\" without the patchouli mixed way up in there.\n\nThen - coffee and vanilla! \nOoooh growling Mama-Bears, this is intoxicating and sweet. It is one of the better examples of a warm gourmand we have out there.\nI honestly don't get a lot of any of the white florals. Can't really detect jasmine or orange blossom at any time, but honestly - they're not needed.\n\nThis is perfect for winter and autumn. It's SO COZY! Hence, it's incredible appeal for colder weather. As for being a night-fragrance? Nah, I spray this any typical day, and I don't fuss.\n\nIMPORTANT TO NOTE: This is not restricted to *any* age. I often smell this on my 70-ish-year-old colleague - and I LOVE IT ON HER! She smells so incredible with this on. I tend to immediately stop in my tracks, turn around, stalk straight back on up to her, and demand that she confirm my olfactory suspicions that this is \"Black Opium\". Thankfully, she finds me charming. If not a little creepy.\nIf anyone tells you this is for teenagers and 20-somethings only, tell them to walk their poor-smelling selves back to the office of \"Convenient Theories For You Daily\", and sign up for a subscription.\nDon't give me that rubbish.\n\nThe downside, folks - The sillage is enchanting (read above), yet variable on folks. Great on my colleague; relatively decent on me. The longevity is...almost universally poor. It takes great restraint on my part not to spray myself 8-10 times a day.\n\nThe bottle? *chef's kiss*\n\n***\n\nKitty rating: 8.5/10\n\n~Compliment Counter~: 2 compliments \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "6": "WARNING! Harsh language ahead.\nReader discretion advised.\n\nI am a male in my late twenties and I was curious to try this scent. Heard it was a dark ''sexy scent for malificent''.\n xd\n\nWhen I smell this, I imagine a somewhat robust dark haired calmly but intensely sexual woman (above 30's)  in leather wearing this in the bedroom and you're about to go town with eachother like lions.\n\nTo me this invokes a feeling of primal, raw, clean but all over the place intense sensual sex ..(lol) As soon as I smelt  this it's on, my male organ and primal brain was activated. \n\nI feel like this is for the dark, quiet, strong mysterious, type of woman (between 30 - 50) who won't overtly express her sexuality, but you can definitely sense it.\n\nI really enjoyed this fragrance.\n\nFrom a male perspective, If my intimate partner were to wear this it would be on immediately.\n\nI signed up just to make this comment for this particular scent.\n\nHope this helped", "7": "There is a reason this perfume is one of the most expensive and sought after perfumes on the market even today. It smells very dark but very sweet sort of like a forbidden romance. All of the notes listed are noticeable except the pear. It smells like a very vanilla-y coffee mixed with some nice flowers, spices, and warmth from the almonds. Absolutely seductive and enchanting scent, very sexy in a scandalous way. In addition, it lasts forever and the silliage is quite nice. It's not a cheap perfume and it does not smell cheap either.", "8": "Coming from an 18 yr/old male, I must say I love this scent. I smelled it on one of those tester papers that come in the Ulta magazines my mom gets often. Then I smelled it in store and Oh, my GOD! How is this so controversial?! This is a beautiful, sexy, feminine fragrance. Sweet without being too cloying or overpowering. The vanilla is well-balanced with the coffee and fruitiness of the pear makes it smell so delicious. I would get it for my mom, but she doesn't like it. Too bad. Will be getting it for my future wife. You can be certain of that. :)", "9": "I have to admit that I was surprised that I love BLACK OPIUM. I thought it would just be another sweet perfume as what I've heard through the grapevine, but to me it's so much more.  \n\nIt's velvety smooth, sensually sweet and has the perfect touch of warmth.  The vanilla, coffee and jasmine lead the way all throughout, the patchouli stays mellow in the background while the cedar does peek out in the dry down.  This is quite lovely like a luxurious caress.  And although it does somehow remind me of other great bold and sweet scents, the longevity of this has blown me away at over 10 hours on my skin.  Black Opium is a big love for me!", "10": "Like many on here, my partner does not care much for fragrance, much less the notes that compose a fragrance. However, this is the only one he consistently picks out when I ask him which one he prefers from my collection. \n\nThe opening pear and pink pepper combines with vanilla beautifully as if it were a poached pear dish and continues to develop into a warm vanilla latte sweetened with nectar that you'd expect to find in white flowers that's grounded by a bit of refined (barely there) patchouli, black licorice and woods. It's so perfect for what it is: sexy date night in a bottle and I love it! \n\nFYI: I'm normally into fresher, greener scents so don't hesitate to give this a try if you tend to lean towards those too.", "11": "I think Black Opium gets most of its bad rep because of how popular it became. There was a certain time you would smell this on half of the women on the street. Somehow it almost became fashionable to hate on this perfume.\nBut I couldn't care less. This one will forever be among my all time favourites. Whats interesting is that I really don't view this as repeatable at all! I've smelled hundreds of fragnances to date but never stumbled across a mainstream perfume with such strong and dominant coffee note. Hell, even with niche perfumes you wont find the same vibe. Have you tried Montale Intense Cafe? Theres no coffee in it! So yes, to me this fragrance is quite unique. No wonder it's loved by so many. It is an incredibly well rounded blend.\nI can't wait to wear this again in the winter soon. I will never get bored with it.\nIt's not a powerhouse lets be honest here, but still an iconic perfume.", "12": "So it seems that getting tons of compliments on a fragrance is a great reason to hate it. Lol! I'll never get the hate... How do you explain you hate a fragrance because \"everybody uses it\"? I don't care how basic they say this is. It is a beautiful, sexy scent, that has gotten me tons of compliments and I'll forever love it and all its flankers!", "13": "No matter what other people think, I adore this scent and I always want to have it in my collection. Although it's called generic, it's the smoothest blend of white florals and vanilla on my skin. It's so cozy and warm, it feels like a cashmere sweater. I detect coffee in the background giving an adddictive quality to this scent. It gives me fluffy and comforting vibes, great for fall/winter. I don't think it deserves to be criticized harshly. Love it!", "14": "I tested this on my lunch break today, an exceptionally cold and bleak day in October. And... OMG!!! This stuff is AMAZING! I just can't stop sniffing my wrist, I smell absolutely delicious! Here's the gourmand vanilla, here's the coffee, the flowers and the patchouli, all in an excellent yummy concoction. And the bottle is gorgeous! \n\nThis is a modern gourmand fragrance, and has absolutely nothing to do with the hit-you-in-the-face powerhouse original Opium. Great for colder weather. \n\nLadies who love crisp, clean, citrusy fragrances, don't go near this stuff, you'll choke. But all of you out there who love La Vie Est Belle, Flowerbomb etcetera, I warmly recommend you to try Black Opium. And for anyone who miss Body Shop's discontinued Amorito, Black Opium might be a good replacement!", "15": "So this perfume clearly brings out a lot of strong opinions. Here\u2019s the thing: it smells great. I wonder if some of the more experienced perfume connoisseurs are missing some of the more subtle notes here; I for sure yet the vanilla, patchouli, floral, peppery thing af the front, but IMO what makes this fragrance worth owning and buying is that as the day wears on the less obvious notes change subtly. At first I get coffee and pepper, then midway through I detect orange and pear, and finally a sandalwood and bitter bottom. \n\nStill the real bottom line for me is that it smells good. I know some people wear perfume to be original or to stand out or see it as a status symbol; I just wanna smell nice. Black Opium delivers on that, with a rich, warm, interesting enough perfume.", "16": "This perfume is not special, nor is it unique.\n\nBut it is young, current, and sexy.\n\nMy husband loves these vanilla-fruitchouli type of scents on me, so I felt the need to oblige him and I wear this on date nights. (Before purchasing)I tested out Black Opium, La Vie Est Belle, Si, and Flowerbomb... and while they are all \"cousins\", Black Opium ended up being our favorite on my skin.\n\nI can't say I pick up the coffee notes in this, and I'm okay with that. Its sweet, but not sickly. A warm sugary vanilla enveloping musky patchouli. Soft white florals with hints of spiced fruits.  It feels more winter appropriate, but I'm sure I will smell this on women year round. \n\nThe lasting power is on point, though it stays fairly close to the skin, which I prefer. \n\nI like it, i'll wear it, and it's yummy. Could it be my signature scent? No.  But if my husband thinks it smells intoxicating, then I am happy to wear this juice. :)", "17": "Such a hated perfume and for what?\n\nIt's a warm cosy coffee perfume that resembles the smell of a vanilla latte in the middle of autumn. Although it's called 'basic' I've always loved it and will always have a special place in my heart as it was one of my first designer fragrances ever.\n\nAsides from that i don't think other peoples criticisms of this fragrance should stop you from buying.", "18": "Black Opium had not been on my radar, but a store clerk offered to spray a card for me and I accepted.  I love the complex balance of sweet and spicy.\n\nWhile it is a flower-sweet feminine fragrance, reminiscent of the delightful V&R Flowerbomb, I definitely get a sense of black coffee brewing throughout this perfume.  Where Flowerbomb\u2019s sweetness floats high like new spring flowers reaching for the sky, the coffee-vanilla-patchouli spice of Black Opium provides a rich, deep, spicy, earthy grounding for the sweetness.\n\nFor me this evokes the words: deep, sweet, mysterious, alluring, sensual, seductive, intriguing, warmth.  I\u2019ll be buying a large bottle ASAP so I can wear it through Autumn and Winter.", "19": "I notice how many of the reviews are negative because it doesn't smell like the original....Umm, maybe because its not called OPIUM its called BLACK OPIUM...so of course it doesn't smell like the original. I actually like it better! If you don't like it, fine, but criticizing it because it doesn't smell like the original makes no sense! If it was supposed to smell like OPIUM, they would have called it just OPIUM! Jeeze!!", "20": "Black Opium. \nTruly an opioid. Addictive and alluring. \nMy go-to going out scent. \n\nYou get home after work. You listen to loud music while getting ready to go out. You have that glass of something, whilst doing your makeup - and the cat eyes and lashes are on point. \nYou indulge in Black Opium as the last step before you leave. And she's with you all night long.\nIt doesn't matter where you go, you just have to make the most of the night before returning to your stressful, serious everyday work week.\nI don't care if it's dressed in your oversized black hoodie, leggins and Doc Martens to match, in an occupied, trashed house, drinking slave vodka and considering joining the moshpit at an underground Punk festival..\nor... if it's at a business cocktail event, dressed in that black figure hugging dress, drinking champagne, smalltalking with your uptight - but- good -mannered- date and his friends .....and discreetly flirting with the waiter who looks like he has some great weed, and you contemplate running away to smoke in an alley somewhere and just laugh and momentarily feel like a f** teenager again.\n....\nThe key sentence is: Don't give a fuck - just be fabulously you.\nThis scent is hyped for a reason and I highly recommend it.\n.... And I'm really looking forward to taking Black Opium out as soon as this Covid hell is over", "21": "I'm gonna go against the general grain here too and say I reeeeally enjoy this one! Being a coffee addict probably doesn't hurt - there is definitely a sumptuously rich coffee note in here which smells a lot like licorice on my skin, coffee, licorice and burnt vanilla. Yum.\nI am a spicy oriental fan but unfortunately the original Opium just never sat well on my skin, not like Cinnabar for instance, which is also very spicy. But I digress. I take this new Black Opium as a stand alone, not a flanker and in that space I really, really enjoy its gritty, punchy, sweet aroma. Yes please, this is definitely for me - and I am NOT a teenager OR a mallrat. Quite the opposite in fact. My advice if I can be so bold? Try this as a stand alone fragrance created by master perfumers to be worn in its own right and see what you find!", "22": "I'm in the minority, but I love Black Opium. I'm NOT a fan of Opium or the like. Like not at all. YSL maybe should have marketed this with a different name.\n\nI get a strong blast of sweetened coffee, right away, and it lingers...in comes jasmine and vanilla...they get louder as it wears, but for me, I can still catch a trace of the coffee. Which is perfect. The patchouli provides spicy woodiness. On my skin the jasmine and coffee are the two notes I smell the most. \n\nI think if you enjoy scents like Black XS, Rhianna Rebelle, Loverdose Tattoo, Killer Queen, Flowerbomb, Lady Million, this is going to be more your type of fragrance.", "23": "This is a vanilla lover's perfume. Definitely ideal for winter and fall for those who experience cold winters. Where I'm originally from (near Central America) you'd have to wear this with caution in a sea-level environment or else, holy hell, can it get cloying. \n\nIf you like warm, vanilla, sweet, and cozy fragrances, then there's a good chance you'll enjoy it. I definitely do, but being that I live in the south, I really have to choose the right time to wear it, and I definitely have to spray it sparingly. It's NOT a fragrance to be heavy-handed with.\n\nIt isn't a complex smell and I don't sense the coffee note much. If I had to make a short description, I'd say it's like a warm vanilla hug mixed with barely-there woodsy notes as a base.", "24": "It's a sweet, spicy, youthful, floral-vanilla-patchouli scent.

It may be a little generic to some but I can't imagine this not becoming a hit amongst the younger and middle aged crowed , at least in my city. \nFirst I thought ,,,where is the coffee??? But now I get it , it's because I don't put sugar in my coffee so my coffee doesn't smell creamy nor sweet. But when I prepared my girlfriends coffee the other day when she was over, I mixed our coffees up by mistake and took a sip from her \"double double \" and bingoooo I thought of 'black opium' . ...Ahhhh that's where the coffee note was hidden , in a sweet milkey coffee, not a dry black one ,\n   I still don't want my coffee sweet , no way, but I want a bottle of black opium anytime :)  smelling and tasting are in the end two different senses after all. \nLove it!!!!\nUpdate , September 8 th , Absolute Love for me.

Feminine and very comforting, but also energizing (maybe because of the coffee?). For me this is definitely a autumn/winter fragrance. I can just imagine how gorgeous it will feel to wear this on a cold, dark, windy day. I don't even care if it is original or not - it smells divine nonetheless. These days I feel that almost every note combination has already been done at some point, so a perfume is always going to remind someone of another perfume.\nI have fallen in love with Black Opium, and I can see myself running to get a full size bottle when the autumn kicks in.", "29": "I could care less if Black Opium resembles other gourmands on the market or similar cheaper version can be found. I love it. It's not about what other people think, it's about what you love and what works for you. I have La Vie Est Belle, Meow, Dolce and Gabanna Femme, Wild Madagascar Vanilla, etc. They all smell similar and delicious. So what. I got a shot of Black Opium one day as a sample and that was all she wrote. Yes, it is similar to the others, but it is still different enough with its sweet-spicy-coffee/danish- bit of fruit-dash of floral-mix that I immediately smell the difference in contrast to those similar scents. So, buy what you like and stop worrying about it being part of the gourmand trend. It's lovely.\n\n#staywokebutthinkforyourself", "30": "This is like a dark spell.

This is not something that you can wear with a cute little outfit or with a shy and demure pose. No, this is pure seduction, for the fearless woman that knows what she wants and how to get it.\nI didn't had much expectations ( basically because of memories from my childhood) but Black Opium is a must.", "31": "Oh, Black Opium. The addictive love of my life. For me this is a true magnum opus fragrance; the price point can be utterly, utterly ridiculous--such is the case when you pay for any designer product--but Black Opium itself smells as opulent and expensive as its price indicates. The coffee and vanilla melt together beautifully; it's warm and toasty and comforting, like being wrapped up in a thick woolly blanket in front of a fire while a blizzard rages outside. It's too heavy for summer but it is PERFECT for winter and has firmly secured itself as one of my Christmas fragrances. It's mature enough to be considered womanly but I feel like the coffee note makes it youthful enough to appeal to several age groups.\n\nCan't wait for cold weather to settle in so I can wear it again!", "32": "Black Opium's fatal flaw is it's name! I mean none of it's two words describe or even go near the real thing. YSL and mostly L'Oreal, wanted to gain money by virtue of the legendary Opium, selling this fragrance as a flanker and I really think that this was a misstep from their part. If this fragrance had another name, it would have been more accepted.\n\nBlack opium is not... well... black! It's barely grey. And does not in any way relate to the legendary Opium!\n\nIt opens FRESH with neroli being the most dominant note. Bright and clear neroli that is later darkened with some vanilla and coffee. When the neroli finally leaves the stage, the jasmine emerges. The drydown brings a small but detectable whiffs of patchouli. The end product is a sweet/gourmand floral like a lot of other recent releases that most of them belong to brands that are marketed by L'Oreal like Lancome (LVEB), Armani (Si), V&R (Flowerbomb), etc... I am not saying that these fragrances smell alike, because they are somewhat different but they all belong to this sweet/fruity floral explosions. \n\nBlack opium is, ironically less powerful of all this category of perfume having mediocre longevity and projection. The scent, however is pretty good... But...", "33": "I sprayed all three, EDP, EDT and Nuit Blanche on different parts of my arm and this one (EDP) is my favorite. It's bolder, sweeter, more vanilla. \n\nEDT felt watered down and for some reason reminded me of lemon coke. \n\nNuit Blanche is the softest of them, but with a prominent musky note (nice and fluffy though, not a sweaty kind).", "34": "Disclaimer: Long, slightly loopy review ahead.\n\nI freaking love this. I loved it from first sniff, and I love it on my skin. I definitely pick up on a lot of coffee, but not like inhaling a bag of freshly ground beans- it's much more like the scent of sitting in a cafe, because you also get vanilla (syrupy vanilla, not a \"baked\" vanilla) along with some jasmine and orange blossom (maybe wafting in through the cafe's open windows). There's some smoke and spice, maybe from the patrons of the cafe. Suffice it to say, this scent is evocative.\n\nThe interesting thing to me is that this fragrance is undeniably sexy, but in a comforting, almost familiar way- but it still maintains that hint of mystery. This isn't the perfume of a nightclub after-hours sex goddess. This is for the strange, mysterious woman who has tons of secrets (maybe dirty ones!) but wears snuggly scarves and would probably get along with your mom.\n\nI bought this for two occasions- the first, I bought it as an early birthday present to myself. I'd been wanting a perfume to kind of \"set the mood\" for the next year of my life. The second occasion is to commemorate the passing of a beloved pet. She was a sweet girl with lots of attitude and this fragrance reminds me of her personality, and it might sound crazy, but if she had been a human, I think this is what she would have picked to wear. It's a comforting scent with a lot of attitude.\n\nAll that being said about the juice (which would get a 10 out of 10 from me!), I think that the bottle is fairly ugly. It looks like a flask and the glitter is chunky and weird. I also don't really get the \"rock and roll\" marketing. There are a lot of other scents that are much more rock and roll, much more loud and fun. While I wouldn't call Black Opium subtle, it's closer to a velvety whisper than to a sharp scream.", "35": "I finally got to test Black Opium and I was positively surprised. In fact, I loved it! \n\nI didn't detect the right notes on my skin - I thought it smelled like dark chocolate, which it doesn't have! I did get the vanilla though, and a fruity undertone. \n\nI understand why people are upset about this new Opium - because it's not like the other Opiums. \n\nBut there is a connection: The POTENT of it. It's very strong, just two sprays filled up the car on the way back home. Its silage is powerful too and be prepared; the scent will get suck in your clothes if you do get it on fabric. \n\nThe bottle is simply gorgeous.", "36": "They've missed a key note in this perfume: Crack\n\nBecause whatever's in this perfume is driving people around me mad?!\n\nI bought this perfume on a Sunday, little 50mL bottle that screwed me over $149 AUD so it was no simple purchase. I bought it home, gave it a harder all over spray and well I was disappointed because I couldn't smell anything on me?! I almost cried!\n\nCue Monday at work.... I spray the perfume in my office and I have coworker after coworker tell me they followed the scent from out in the hall way into my office and have to smell more. And more. And more... Every day! And it happened at the shops. And at the beauticians. People can't get enough and I'm not complaining :) It'll only become an issue when I start attracting wild life. \n\nThe coffee/vanilla combo is soft, dark and sexy. For some reason I can't smell it on myself but if people a few meters away can then you know the sillage is crazy. I should've bought a bigger bottle but for now I'm just happy with my bottle and completely in love with my perfume.", "37": "This has been slated by you guys,but for what it's worth, I have to add my two penneth here as I've been wearing this all day and it's not bad. \nI wore the original Opium back in the 80's and loved it.  This is nothing like that in any way, shape or form other than it has the word 'Opium' in the name, however let's take it for what it is.\nA Frederic Malle it ain't, but it's not \u00a3250 a bottle either.\nIt's a thick, syrupy, heavily spiced, coffee flavoured, gourmand perfume.  \nIt has outstanding staying power and great silage. \nYes it resembles Lancome Vie, but it's been created as a 'safe' crowd pleasing perfume, which will sell very well in the coming months leading up to Christmas.  \nIt's all about the money honey, this will make a lot of money for YSL, they won't have to try too hard and it's got the sell ability factor, and yes, it's cloyingly sweet, will be floating around every club, pub and street corner, but it's not a bad smell. It is what it is.", "38": "Very inoffensive while also being rich and pleasing. There's a lot of notes here that work very well together. I love pear, orange blossom, and jasmine. Also the vanilla makes it really smooth. It is a straight up sweet fragrance so I'm surprised it is not making me feel ill- a sign of quality ingredients I think.  \n\nThere's a reason why it's so popular. Hater's gonna hate, you do you boo.", "39": "My first real perfume purchased at age 26. Everyone is different. Especially with body chemistry. My fianc\u00e9 and I picked out fragrances for each other, and this was by far his favorite. (Color me surprised with how much he hates sweets!) my fianc\u00e9 seems to prefer heavier date-night perfumes. (I believe my personal favorite was Jimmy Choo's house which sadly didn't make it into his top 3)\n\nI detect a lot of licorice, vanilla, coffee, toffee, and just sexy smoke. Apparently it's basic. Oh well. Every time I smell it I enjoy it, I feel sexier and enjoy smelling myself. Here's my story on how I learned to stop shopping for complements and instead shop for what my fianc\u00e9 and I like:\n\nAt first, my confidence took a hit when reading the reviews by the oh-so knowledgeable fragrance snobs that can be found on any perfume encyclopedia website. (I'm looking at you, Basenotes). \"Oh no!\" I thought, \"The all-knowing perfume gods and goddesses would snicker at my choice!\" The last thing I want is to seem...immature! Like a cotton-candy basic B! So I went for what is popular. What everyone likes. But guess what, that doesn't exist. I imagine this has lot to do with the reality that is SMELLS ARE SUBJECTIVE AS HELL. The chemical reaction depends on body chemistry. So something that I love on my best friend can be very much unloved by me when I wear it. And you know what, I think that's pretty F*n neat. \nSo, yes, I love Black Opium and I don't care if it's basic. People online get so selfish and rude about what they love and what they hate. Just like any hipster, putting down what's popular becomes a right-of-passage. So, to all the people that are 'offensively basic' for loving this, F that! Stop being such a try-hard for a handful of strangers and let yourself be a try-hard for yourself instead. :)\n*Unless you're the person that loves forcing your scent on anyone else within a mile radius, in which case seriously, please consider the common public when you spray and f*ck you kindly.

Growing up poor, I could never be able to afford nice and REAL perfume until I was in college. At that time I scored a fully-funded scholarship abroad and have more money by working and from the scholarship itself, I didn't know where to buy perfume at other countries so I went to Sephora and found this. It was on sale, and I had more money to splurge a bit. Found out that this was actually a 'branded' perfume, and this is the first perfume that turned me into growing collection. Now that I'm able to afford perfumes for many bottles, a bottle of YSL Black Opium will always be there in my rack for me to remember how far I have went through in life.", "41": "Honestly, I really don\u2019t care if people find this overrated, overused or too mainstream. It\u2019s about what you like and what works for you and I have used Black Opium for years and there is nothing in my collection that compares with how well the coffee note blends with the vanilla. I have tried so many so called dupes because Black Opium doesn\u2019t last on me but they all are terrible and don\u2019t even compare. I don\u2019t even think I need to really speak on this fragrance, I am sure everyone has said it all really. But it is a great fragrance, it is timeless, it has character regardless of what anyone says and it very very sexy. One of the sexiest fragrances on the market and a compliment getter for sure.", "42": "I'm a big fan of the OG Black Opium. The dark/bitter coffee-based opening with white floral is so good. I actually wear this with jeans and hoodies, and never thought of it as a \"clubbing scent\". \n\nThe problem is that I've been noticing that my bottle is becoming sweeter and sweeter. My bottle is about 2 years old. The drydown has become so sweet that I feel like I need an insulin shot. \n\nUntil the drydown (which smells like Starbucks frappuccino), I thoroughly enjoy the scent. I don't really care that it's popular...the most important thing is that I enjoy the scent, and my opinion is the only opinion that matters to me :)", "43": "People are really hating on this because it is popular, and it is popular for a reason, its one of the best scents i have ever tried.

On my skin it is very gourmand, but I can tell there is just a hint of floral. I don't pick up any particular note though, like coffee etc. It just smells sweet. Possibly my bottle is aging as it's a few years old now. But it still smells really good and I won't have a problem finishing it. I will rebuy this once it's gone. I have tried the Zara clone and I prefer the original. The clone is sweeter and smells like a tootsie roll.", "45": "I had to say it: Black Opium is popular for a reason. Like it or not, it started the whole coffee note thing on designer perfumes. It seems to get a lot of hate, however, it\u2019s been an inspiration for other fragrances such as the only one, coffee break, la nuit tresor...\n\nI\u2019m sure most will know how this smells like, it\u2019s warm, cozy, sweet. A mix of creamy white flowers with a bit of licoriced coffee. It\u2019s one of my complement getters. I think this shines on cold days/evenings. From all its flankers the original edp is the one I enjoy the most. It\u2019s quite long lasting on me. If used right this is quite misterious, seducing and inviting. A YES for me.", "46": "Wow! This fragrance is crazy. On women, this is amongst my favorites, along with Coco Mademoiselle. But Coco is like the day, while Black Opium is the night. Alluring, dark, daring and sophisticated.

Don't know how the performance is as I don't wear this myself, but to my nose, this stuff is potent.", "47": "Uuuggghhhhh yeah! And i mean UUUGGGHHHH YEAH! My man is crazy about this perfume. I am crazy about this perfume. I can sniff it all day long. Love this one cause I finally found something that can equally earn my love and my man's attention.

In my opinion, the smell does not match the commercial: there is NOTHING BLACK or mysterious in it... it's sweet and \"sticky\".  \n\nHas something in common with Gucci Guilty (maybe the combination of vanilla and pepper?). Nice, but a bit suffocating to me. \n\nMy husband loves it - he says it's the best scent ever - so as you know: every nose has its smell....", "49": "This perfume smells expensive. I LOVE it.

The opening is where the biggest differences between these scents lie. I find Aventus to have an almost smooth soapy start which CDNIM doesn't duplicate. CDNIM is a lot more citrus rather than pineapple in the opening. This citrus start lasts for about 20 minutes to a half hour, projecting very boldly before INTENSE MAN smokey, birchy elements start to claim more space in the composition.  \nLike INTENSE the ingredients of INTENSE MAN are of a decent quality. No where near Creed standards but still very impressive for a cheapie fragrance that mimics a high end Niche scent below $40...This is definitely no Insurrection Pure and the rest. The blend is spot on after the opening and the purchase made me happy as I can start my day with Aventus and decant this for instances when I want to add more oomph to the scent later in the afternoon. So this $30 purchase will greatly extend the life of my $300 purchase. I was considering owning a flacon of Aventus. Key word...\"WAS\". INTENSE MAN has made my need to spend $700 obsolete.  \nI get 6 hours of longevity on this before either it dies down to a noticeable skin scent or the olfactory fatigue kicks in. But for a scent that is again almost identical to a scent nearly 10x's its cost, with decent ingredients and smells great...I'll take it. I own empty 5ml atomizers which I put to good use anyway. The sillage is great though. An hour after applying, a classmate said she could smell me on an elevator i was on at least 5-8 minutes before her. \nThis is the best Aventus killer available from what I've smelled (Update: my Al Dur Al Maknoon by Lataffa review has since changed this opinion) and I've smelled all known suspects except for Afnan's Supremacy Silver. At a price I paid of $36 this buy was a down right NO BRAINER. Many sellers have become aware of its popularity and are charging over $60 for INTENSE and at that price it's still worth it to me. Some may even prefer this to Aventus as the fruitiness of the scent last longer in the opening and the smokiness is more pungent in the dry down. I might be crazy but to me this scent has some of the best of the smokey Creed batches. If AVENTUS was reformulated and the juice they ended up selling was batches of CDNIM with a slightly better quality of ingredients, most Aventus fans would not be that upset by the change and some would consider it an improvement.  \nSimply put: this scent is THE Aventus Killer...And will become to some including myself, THE AVENTUS REPLACER... \n7.5/10 \nYouTube Channel- Simply Put Scents", "1": "I was Wearing CDNIM when a lady asked me \u201cAre you wearing Creed?\u201d I said \u201cyes\u201d \ud83d\ude08", "2": "This smells exactly like Aventus. I own both. People who say they don't smell the same are just salty that they don't look as \"cool\" with their $400 fragrance anymore cuz other people are smelling the exact same for $20 and/or they think their nose is so experienced that they can smell some big difference... Just sayin.", "3": "Having worn both CDNI and Aventus, I can unequivocally tell you that:  \n1. This is NOT Aventus. Especially in the opening. Where Aventus is softer, sweeter and pineapple forward, CDNI is a bit harsh and synthetic. But it does get better... \n2. CDNI evolves into something very close to Aventus after about 20-30 minutes. The initial hit of lemon and perfumy musk fades, giving way to a nice balance of birch and pineapple, with considerable depth. Smoky grilled pineapple essence. \n3. CDNI leans more on the smoky birch side of the Aventus batch conundrum. So if you prefer a sweeter version, just hit it with a touch (10-15%) of Demeter Pineapple - it really does get it \"there.\"  \n4. For best results, plan to let this potent juice air out for up to 30 minutes before even considering entering an enclosed space with other living beings. Trust me on this - otherwise you will NOT evoke the type of reaction you're gunning for. Learn from my mistake! \n5. Even though this is a minimal risk in light of its thrifty price tag, you should give thought to who you are when considering a purchase of CDNI. If you're some self-righteous purist or self-proclaimed frag expert who just can't abide wearing clones of a $3-400 \"masterpiece\" OF COURSE you're gonna hate this! Just skip it and refrain from the elitist whining about others whose sensibilities differ from yours.  \nOTOH, if you really like the vibe of Aventus but consider it preferable to get 90% \"there\" for <$25 vs 100% for >$300, then this is probably a safe and happy buy. It has been for me and countless others. \nDiffr'nt strokes for diffr'nt folks!", "4": "I have never smelled the snob starter kit essential Aventus, neither this. I just want to state something. \nGuys, are you really complaining about a fragrance that costs 25 dollars that it's not EXACTLY the same as a 300 dollar Aventus? Ah, no shit man, what a miracle! This snobbery bullsh*it is getting ridiculous. Not everyone has hundreds of dollars to get a fragrance that only fragrance lovers appreciate ( you will get more compliments with individuel or F black, lmao). If Aventus smells good, and this is close to it, then this is a good fragrance for 25 dollars.

This is real, fresh cherry. It\u2019s perfect and I want to drink it. But Tom Ford can get lost if he thinks it\u2019s worth over $300. Maybe I\u2019m too anti-capitalist for this hobby. \nOh and also this lasts like 3 hours maximum. Sure, you can reapply, but at this price point? It\u2019s a yikes from me.", "3": "I recently marched myself (pale, mushroom-like, undersocialised) to my local old rich lady department store and to my delight was able to sample Lost Cherry.

I adored it. However, the rumours are true; the longevity is less than ideal. I also got some weird fishy amines at around hour 3, but they subsided quickly.  \nWear this while you poison your third husband with cyanide - it will mask the scent, and wears off quickly enough that the police won't be able to track you via sillage.", "4": "I finally got a sample of this after having mixed results smelling it in stores on the rare occasion I\u2019m near a TF boutique/counter.

It\u2019s seriously so delicious and easily a compliment getter, which I\u2019ve already gotten one unsolicited compliment on it.  \nAt first, the dry down was a little like Tom Ford Vanille Fatale, which I also own. It\u2019s like they took that scent and made it more gourmand and crowd-pleasing. They\u2019re not entirely redundant, but worth mentioning the similarity. It\u2019s definitely got that Tom Ford signature DNA. I don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s a common denominator in a lot of TF fragrances.  \nThe cherry that it starts with is at 100, and then dials down to maybe 10 by the end of its life. That incredible cherry lasts about 20 minutes to an hour. Then there\u2019s this almond and vanilla that play so well. Those notes can smell cheap sometimes, but they\u2019re exquisitely executed here.  \nIt\u2019s middle of the road unisex. I\u2019m a man, and I have no shame wearing it. I\u2019d wear this with a suit to anything confidently. Maybe not an interview (Clive Christian Rock Rose or 1872 for that), but anything else! This has date night written all over it, too. I\u2019ll also wear it in jeans. It\u2019s just a great all-rounder. \nSeasonally, it\u2019s probably best suited for cooler weather, but I\u2019ll have this on year-round. It\u2019s got a crispness to it that will work in Spring/Summer. Mississippi Summers are blazing, though, so I\u2019ll probably reach for my former favorite Tom Ford, Venetian Bergamot. \nMy wearing is limited, but 12 hours later it\u2019s still detectable about 3 inches from the skin. It performs best through the first 5 hours or so. Could be a little better performance for the projection phase, but I\u2019m almost giving it a pass due to having a masterpiece scent. \nI got my 100 mL bottle on the way. Got it discounted, but it may be worth full price. A lot more unique than Aventus nowadays, and this can probably garner more compliments. I always judge a fragrance against Aventus, even if they\u2019re nowhere similar.  \n10.5/10 masterpiece scent. 8/10 projection/sillage. 8.5/10 longevity (wish the cherry note would last a little longer.

So many memories, so many parties, so many times you'd watch a girl's eyes roll into the back of her head because you smelled so good, entire relationships were started because of that juice. \nWhen I smelled ADG Profumo for the first time I absolutely HATED it. \"What have you done to my beloved Acqua!?\" I thought. To me it was as if it had sold it's soul, forgoing it's Friday night jeans and button up shirt for a suit and tie and trading it's youthful exuberance for a touch more class and sophistication. This was ADG for the corporate masses, power lunches and business meetings, sealing the deal with handshakes in an upscale Michelin star restaurant with weird food on tiny plates instead of high fives and shots of tequila at your local cantina ... and then it finally hit me... \nThis was Acqua Di Gio all grown up, and I was like the guy still wearing his high school letter jacket in his 40's (in a fragrance kind of way)  \nSince that realization I've come to admit that my hatred for ADG Profumo was for all the wrong reasons, I was blinded by nostalgia, and I didn't want the magic of the original to end. In all honesty I knew the writing was on the wall since the introduction of Dior Sauvage. After a few wearings I'm reluctant to confess I actually do like it (just a little bit), it really is a fantastic scent. But it will never take the place of the original Acqua for me, to me wearing Profumo is like dating someone who looks and acts too similar to an ex I used to love.

Dior has a winner with this one, I can see it easily becoming a best seller. I know Dior believes this, too. I don't think they'd pony up for Depp if they didn't. It DOESN'T smell like Bleu de Chanel. (Which, by the way, everyone said was boring/sucked and is now one of the most recommended fragrances for guys who want just one.) It smells like citrus, spicy woods, and a touch of a musky character from the ambroxan. I put this on almost 8 hours ago and can still smell it well.\n\nBottom line. Smell it for yourself. You might actually like it. If you don't... well hey, more for me.", "7": "Just tested this for the first time. So this is my initial impressions.\n\nLove it.\n\nOpens like a mix between Aventus, Fierce, Curve and Legend. But at the moment, I find it much more pleasing than all of these scents. I smelt it and the smile on my face expanded until I looked like a little boy at Christmas. I think this scent is sexy as hell & I'm going to purchase a bottle of this glorious juice tomorrow. Seriously good stuff. This will be a massive hit. \n\nKicks Aventus's ass in my honest opinion.\n\nSo far it's been on my skin for 2 hours and it's still projecting loudly. \n\nJust my initial thoughts! I'm sure time will tell.", "8": "When frag like this gets perfume rating 3.89 out of 5 from 10thousand+ votes, i really started to have a lot of disbelief in this frag community. This easily should pass 4, shame on you guys\n\nI mean, for those who hate it so much, just do a test, anyday anytime, put your fav perfume vs this one in crowd and ask them which one they like. Im sure, like 100% sure, you will find out that your fav is in fact not that superior against sauvage, which means, objectively, sauvage is a good one. Why this get so much hate it didnt deserve??\n\nFor those who havent tried this, fact is : girls love this. Enough said", "9": "Haters gonna hate. \n\nThis is a very masculine scent that generates a lot of compliments. It lasts long, has moderate to great sillage and isn't really generic. No matter what people say, you can clearly distinguish Sauvage when someone is wearing it.\n\nSure, it's a bit synthetic. Yes, it's a bit linear. Mmmkay, there is no real innovation for that matter. Yes, the marketing is a bit tacky...\n\nBut if you're not a fragrance purist, why care? If you wear fragrances to please yourself and others and you're looking for something sexy, a bit fresh and masculine you have a winner here. No mystical and magical fragrance god is going to strike you down for enjoying a mass appealing fragrance. I'll bet you that in 2 years people will be recommending this all over the place.\n\nGlad I bought it, great office scent. No wimpy scent yet very acceptable. Great balance in this one.\n\nCompliments? Easy my friends. Girls from all age groups will like this, men will notice your presence and wonder why you seem so alpha today.\n\nEvolution? Starts with a 'zinnnggg' of freshness but quickly evolves to a woody ambery base, very punchy, very present. Doesn't evolve too much any more but that's ok, all the good stuff is in this punchy scent trail. Guess the punch comes from the peppers.", "10": "Been a while since I wrote my last review. Reason being I haven't really smelled anything worth commenting over. I have been following this fragrance since its release. Sniffing it a couple time a month. From November until End of March I got multiple samples from Sephora. I wore this in warmer weather, to church, out about town, to work and even around the house cleaning up. I had been on a buying freeze for at least the last year or so.\n\nHowever, I tried to ignore it I just kept coming back to it. Generic like a nice blue tie and blue suit. Unoriginal, like a good romantic comedy. Sharp, musky, spicy, soapy (deodorant maybe)? Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes. However, it smells downright wonderful and everyone you encounter will most like think the same (well until it reaches Aqua Di Gio or La Male status). \n\nVersatile, mature yet not too serious, universal without being bland, sexier than most but not trying too hard. It did what I never thought a designer could do. It knocked Bleu De out of first place in its category. \n\nSince purchasing I have worn it everyday to really get a feel for it to really make sure I could make this bold statement....this is the best designer released in a long time. I would say ever but not going to do that in fear of being hyperbolic. \n\nI own a bunch of stuff. This is what Aventus is without the price tag. Some will find this too bold others will find it to bland which hits a sweet spot in my collection. My two cents. Great Job Dior", "11": "I Really don't care what a 50 year old snob says about sauvage. all I care is that it smells good(not the greatest),it projects beastly and most important thing,ladies love this.synthetic or not it's a compliment magnet.\nscent:8/10\nlongevity:8.5/10\nsillage:9/10\noverall:9/10", "12": "I give it 6 more months until more people buy this and get compliments from others, then everyone hating on this will have it in their top 10 lists.", "13": "The people who dislike this perfume is because everybody else is wearing it. It is uber popular because it is just incredible, which inevitably is its downfall. People want to wear fragrances that smell great and stand out, not smell like everybody else. Before it was joop, then davidoff cool water, then Jean Paul gautier le male, then paco rabanne 1 million, then paco rabanne Invictus etc. I love this fragrance but feel I can't wear it because everyone else does, but I'm not gonna hate on it because it's popular. It is an absolute masterpiece. Smells sensational, performs like a beast and if you blind buy it you won't be disappointed.", "14": "So I smelled this and I have to disagree with the majority. I'm not disappointed at all - I actually like this fragrance! Is it super interesting or innovative? Not particularly.  But I like that it has subtle elements of Aventus, Bleu de Chanel, and other fresh, woody fragrances. \n\nNow, to address some of the mass disappointment. \n1) Just because something has a HUGE marketing campaign, doesn't mean it is going to be innovative. Bleu de Chanel is a classic example. Often it is an indication that the company is looking for a big sales push, that's all. \n2) Sometimes when designer houses create something really different and outside the box, IT FAILS miserably.  That is to say the consumer doesn't respond positively and they're left with a huge failure.  A good example of this is JPG's Kokorico, which was really off-the-beaten-path.  That was a flop. Its not even on sale in the United States as a result of such poor sales. So if you're Dior, what's more important? Innovation or successful sales?\n3) This WILL be a successful fragrance commercially. 12 months from now this will lead all fragrances in sales because its extremely pleasant, long lasting (on my skin) and will garner positive feedback.  That is waht moves bottles off the shelves.  \n4) Think about it this way - if they sell a ton of Sauvage, then they'll be more likely/willing to sell something more creative/experimental like Dior Homme, Eau Sauvage Parfum, etc. \n\nSometimes you have to take the good with the mediocre and enjoy them for what they are. Hope that helps.", "15": "People should relax a little. It's only a fragrance. I mean, you don't like it, you don't buy it. That's it. Everyone should respect people's opinions as they are all very subjective. This is a nice, smooth fragrance that is easily wearable as opposed to many other Dior fragrances. It is not offensive in any way and I think it will become a hit. Yes, agreed, nothing groundbreaking, but what is these days? For those who like it, please enjoy! For those who don't, keep on looking and hope you all find a new love soon! Cheers", "16": "The truth about Sauvage.\n\n1.  The Fragrance Snobs\n\n\"This smells like toilet bowl cleaner.

This is by no means a work of art and a chemical mess.\"\n\n2.  The Fan Boys\n\n\"This is a pantry dropper.  This is the best fragrance ever.  Fuck anybody who down votes this masterpiece.

Dylan Blue, Prada Carbon", "17": "My wife chose this scent for me. I mention that to draw a distinction between women's and men's reaction to the fragrance. There is considerable dislike for this fragrance but I urge you to consider the source before allowing reviews to sway you. For me it draws daily compliments. I literally find women leaning in to sniff.  The initial scent hits with a tremendous blast of something resembling Aventus which I presume to be the bergamot. That fades in 20-30 minutes and you are riding a spicy ambroxan train for hours... I feel that it stays linear from that point. Its fresh and clean. Not in the least bit cloying or overpowering. It radiates within arms length and if there is a slight breeze will travel a bit further. Get a sample and give it a chance.", "18": "From where to start? Well, this scent has just been released, worldwide, on September 2nd, 2015.\n\nThe perfumer of the House, Fran\u00e7ois Demachy, said that to create this cologne he was inspired by the man and his strong and unmistakable masculinity, one that transcends time and fashion. Thinking about it, it's easy to understand the choice of Johnny Depp as the face of the campaign, since he has this fashion and rebel side, that is virile and timeless at the same time.\nAnother demand that the perfumer made to himself, was to create a raw and noble fragrance using only natural and refined ingredients, selected with caution.\n\nThe composition was made basically on two main accords: the citrusy and the ambery. But it's not as simple as it seems. It has notes of Calabrian bergamot (citrus bergamia), ambroxan (chemical compound obtained through esclareol which, in turn, is extracted from Clary Sage), Sichuan Pepper and a doubly distilled patchouli, in order to obtain higher quality. There are also shades of lavender, geranium and vetiver.\n\nDior Sauvage has already arrived bringing many contradictions. The owners of the first bottles around the world filled the forums with negative criticism, saying that it is a copy of Bleu, by Chanel. Others said that this is the worst male creation of Dior. And I wonder: How can it be the worst creation of Dior, since it is being compared to a scent that has been praised for months, by several users in the world, as the best scent of the competitor?\nThat's why, once again, I say: beware of generalized statements, because you may end up stalling in your own words.\n\nThe truth is: there is a resemblance between both of them. However, Dior Sauvage is much more natural, but also exudes a lot less, although possessing good durability. The other is infinitely more synthetic, so it wins in projection and lasting power.\n\nWhen touches the skin, Sauvage is citric, almost sour and very natural. Quickly, you can feel a spicy facet, which evolves into a creamy and slightly sweetened base. And that\u2019s all! There are no hidden surprises or miraculous evolutions.\nFor this reason, I would rather say that Dior Sauvage is an intimate (and very soft!) scent that could have been a lot more interesting. There was a lot of suspense and a lot of expectation around this release. And when we created a lot of expectations that don't come true, we get frustrated. But to say that this is the worst scent of the House, I think is a little too much. It is a superlative somewhat strong, for a House like Dior and a perfumer with such a curriculum like Fran\u00e7ois Demachy.\n\nI would rather say that Sauvage is a response to the competition, stating that you don't always have to speak loudly to be heard. But I can't be a hypocrite: I was hoping for something more kinky and wild, like Johnny Depp.\n\nTo finish, the bottle is beautiful, heavy, with good ergonomics and in the same style of the bottles of La Collection Priv\u00e9e. Its spray is soft and vaporizes a smooth cloud. It has a blue gradient, which is most noticeable against the light and brings a magnetic cover that just fits in the right position, making the proper alignment of Dior\u2019s logo.", "19": "So, im just back from the department store where I received a sample of this fragrance.  I read a great deal of negativity here and on Base notes about this fragrance and I usually am in agreement with the majority about fragrances whether reported good or bad.  This time im in disagreement.  Yea upon first spray it didnt blow me away but the magic came about 30 mins later when boooom an unexpected powdery, soft and animalistic scent blessed my olfactory senses.  Its amazing and I will purchase a 100ml bottle later today.  I really did not expect much with the poor reviews but I guess this is a fragrance that works with my skin and ticks all the right boxes from an accord point of view.  I guess the lesson learned today is always judge for your self and not what the majority like or dislike,that is if you dont already \u263a", "20": "In my opinion, this is right below beast mode. It has amazing performance. I guess I can understand some of the hate but the scent itself is awesome to me. This one is very sexy and a very good compliment getter. People are going to smell you.

Been into cologne collecting for a while. I own a few fragrances that are compared to this. I have Aqva Atlantiqve and Dylan Blue. This is the king. Is it great for someone who doesn\u2019t know anything other than knowing it smells good, sure. Isn\u2019t that the goal? To smell good? Ultimately we all get into this hobby to smell good. We have our own reasons and likes to keep us in it, but this smells good. It smells great!\n\nIt gives me confidence. Struggled with that my whole life and this makes me feel confident. While very simplistic, this also is very complex. Popular? Is it.... I\u2019ve never smelled this on anyone else, think about it. For every 10 men, only 2 probably wear cologne. Most guys typically won\u2019t spend $95 on a bottle. So, you will smell different.\n\nThis also smells nothing like any of the comparisons, they are salty ambroxan. This is not an aquatic feeling fragrance.\n\nThis is my date fragrance, because it just works. Never ever have I gotten a negative reaction.\n\nPeople on here dump on it, it smells like a 4.50, not a 3.68. All in all, great fragrance for how it smells and how it makes me feel.

It's arguably the longest-lasting blue fragrance ever made. \n\nTo pretend like this isn't a good fragrance is dishonest.

YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WEARING SAUVAGE!\n\nAnd the compliments? I hate to say it, but Dior Sauvage is the king of compliments.\n\nSo, till now we have a very good, mass appealing scent and also we have a versatile perfume. What is left, is the performance.

Either we like it or not, this is a King Designer Fragrance. Everyone saying that it smells so \"synthetic\" blah blah blah, is just watching some youtube reviews and comments here what he just watched on the videos.

DO NOT listen to these people, the fragrance is absolutely top notch, with very good performance from a fresh fragrance and the perfect combination of notes, it just matches well. This is something for the summer heat and works well with people of a younger age, it's a brilliant fragrance that has a distinctive bergamot note, with sort of a soapy vibe.

I have gotten compliments by people sitting two chairs away or just walking by, so projection is pretty good too. \nIf you're on the brink of buying this edT, at least give it a chance for a couple of days by ordering a sample.

The bitterness and uncompromising masculinity is what pleases me most.And it's versatility - can be worn four season equally . I don't get so much citrus or pepper, but the elemi resin and ambroxan are playing the big game here with their murky,bitter  and dark grey odour ,and patchouli plus some lavender with supporting role , which add some woodiness and freshness.Reminds me the smell of Colophon resin ( Turpentine oil ?) and melting tenol when you soldering. And it is really working with women - some of them ( quite unknown for me) start disturbing  my private space more often and without any obvious reason...))) Very interesting fragrance , also very long lasting ( 16 hours on me!), superb sillage and beautiful classical packaging . Well worth the price.", "34": "\"It smells like a man\"\n\nIf you are a normal person (like me) that aims to have just a bunch of fragrances, IGNORE THE LOW SCORES SEEN ONLINE.

If you need 1 fragrance to do it all you can def get this, BDC, prada luna rossa, YSL Y. Dont let the negative reviews or people tripping about some reformulation stop you from getting this scent its still good, just popular.", "37": "So, I don't really understand all of the hate for Sauvage. Yes, I get that it is not \"niche,\" it is not \"higher end.\" Who cares? One or two sprays of this and it lasts for hours (which is more than I can say for a LOT of niche fragrances I have encountered). The scent is clean and crisp, and has a nice sexy edge to it.\n\nIs it the best Dior has to offer? No.\n\nIs it the worst? Definitely not.\n\nIt is nice for a daily, casual work scent, or a night out for a martini. Very versatile. \n\nI honestly get so many compliments from it.\n\n4/5", "38": "At first let me take the comments ... I put on my skin and I had a good surprise , sensational flavor !

When it first came out I bought it, but ended up not liking it because I found it a bit too synthetic and actually gave it away to a friend.\n\nYesterday at night I went to try it again because a friend asked me to and honestly doens't stop impressing me on how strong this is! I put a single spray on my left wrist at 9pm, today is 10am and I have already slept a full night and showered and the thing is still blowing up!!! I'm at work and my whole office smells like sauvage, from a single 12h+ spray on a wrist...\n\nSo if you want most of all to have your scent noticed and last as long as a perfume can, get compliments and smell nice generally all the time, look no more.\n\nThis is perfect for per example a tinder date. You want to please, you want her to notice it from distance, use sauvage and the waiter in the bar next door will notice it. \nThe only risk you take is that her sleazy ex used it too.", "40": "Normally, I do not review this soon after trying a fragrance.  It takes weeks and weeks of wearing for me to truly have a grasp on what a scent is trying to say.  I do, however, feel compelled to say a few words about this because I think we're reaching dire circumstances regarding Dior's latest release.  \n\nI received a sample of Sauvage with another purchase just three days ago.  You can call this review premature but I've been reflecting on the scent since then.  The fact of the matter, quite frankly, is that I can't for the life of me figure out the hate for this.  The only thing I can even fathom is that everyone reviewing this is a hardcore collector who have smelled and owned much more complex compositions from the Dior house.  While it's true, this fragrance isn't particulaley challenging, I would say that is whay the Dior private line is for.  If you want challenging smells try Bois D'Argent or Leather Oud.   They're masterful blends.  Sauvage was never intended to be the next pinnacle acheivement of the fragrance world.  It was meant to be a main-line fragrance in the same vein with Bleu de Chanel and Acqua di Gio.  And to that, Dior has created something very good here.  I personally think its better than both fragrances.  I do not think this smells even remotely similar to Bleu as some people suggest.  It's only similarity is the type of fragrance this is from a marketing standpoint.  It was hints of several fragrances but it still remains unique and me.  It's an ethereal and airy fragrance.  It's not wet, but it's not dry.  It's got a mystery to it that invites you to try and find out more.  Women are going to want a man to smell like this.  And that is why this is going to be a high seller. The marketing campaign for this has been top notch, Johnny Depp or no Johnny Depp, and I expect this to do very well (by all accounts it already has).  \n\nThe bottom line here is that Dior is such a wel regarded house that any release of theirs is going to be expected to top the one before it.  For a house that has released such iconic fragrances as Eau Savuage (Parfum as well), Fahrenehit, Homme, and Homme Intense, people are ovbiously going to have high expectations.  Perhaps their expectations were dampened a bit when this was released.  But if you step back and appreciate what Dior is trying to do here I think this would be much more positively received.  As it stands I think this is going to be a winner, despite the lukewarm response from fragrance-heads.", "41": "My fiance wears this gorgeous men's fragrance. It is his favorite. My favorite on him is actually Guerlain's Habit Rouge. All the women we know young and old love this too. They hug him a little longer. I don't mind. Enjoy ladies. I have not one bad thing to say about Sauvage. It wears like a dream on him and is long lasting. It is smooth, warm and dreamy as has been stated here numerous times. It is a very polarizing fragrance but then the good ones usually are. I give it a 10/10.", "42": "I'm really not understanding all the negative reviews with this one.  This fragrance will most certainly fill a void for many, it's suitable for day or night, office or casual.\n\nAt first spray, I get a citrus smell that has a very noticeable musky aroma lying beneath.  Like many reviewers have mentioned before, I hated this smell at first, actually leaving the department store extremely disappointed.  2 hours later, I was laying around in my apartment, and I kept getting whiffs of Sauvage, it was like it was getting stronger.  I drove back to Macy's and purchased immediately.  \n\nThe drydown on this is amazing, one of the best I have smelled in years.  It does remind me of a cologne that would have been very popular during the late 80's early 90's.  It's got that aquatic fresh but somehow dirty vibe going on.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with Sauvage.  Do I consider is to be of the same high quality as some of Dior's previous releases, no I don't.  Nor did I want it to be.  I wanted an everyday, fresh scent that lasts, and Sauvage scores an A+ in all of those areas.

This is a very good fragrance! The opening has some similarities with Aventus, I mean the feeling that I get is like the feeling that i've while wearing Aventus. Of course it's a completely different scent , but I love the opening. I love also its development. It's sexy and addictive. I agree that this is not a masterpiece but who cares , it's absolutely good and attention grabbing. Perfect for business and perfect for a Friday night too! This is not a niche scent and this is not a unique smell either but... Who cares?this is not the point. My advice is to get a sample and try a full wear of it. It's a lovely fragrance. Good silage, good longevity, good scent, compliments galore...! Very nice ;).", "48": "Almost love at first sight!\n\nUnlike many complains here, it impressed me!  Well, I do agree with people if that's not something so eccentric that we used to expect from Dior house like the way we experienced Eau Sauvage, Fahrenheit and Homme; This is the same story as of Dior Higher, Dior Dune, Chanel Allure Sport and Bleu de Chanel: Not really that novelty we were used to see, but still a definitely divine, lovely and high quality scents, in Dior and Chanel high order.\n\nIt is simple and has a very linear scent: it almost stays the same from the very top phase to the end of the base:  At first you have a very juicy lime scent, a little sweet and mixed with a pinch of pepper and a touch of wood.  Soon it turns into a sea breeze (even if you're in a pretty dry place and several hundred miles away from the coastline) and stimulates the feel of a summer breeze from the sea, thanks to the ambroxan.\n\nFinally, at the base phase, you have the same scent minus aquatic notes, while the lime is sour now and no more sweet.  Spice and woody note are all standing by you giving you the real feeling of a dry place and sea fades away.  Quite nose-stroking and bringing you joy all the way.\n\nLongevity is about 30 hours on my skin (yes, Thirty!), while the projection is good for about 7-8 hours, then turns gradually soft.\n\nIt is quite great for spring and fall time, yet pretty nice for summer, but I doubt recommending it for the chill season.\n\nJust another masterpiece from Mr. Demachy and entirely a great package, overall.\n\nThe flacon shape and paint is just simple and beautiful.  The cap is magnetic with the new Christian Dior logo that gives you a great feeling, anytime you look at it.  Dior DNA is present in every single element of this cutie.\n\nLest I forget, this time, Dior has employed the same old trick as of Chanel: the amount of sprayed liquid from the flacon has increased almost twice: this would spray about twice the usual amount within each whiff, resulting you to feel the frag has more longevity and projection, while it results more consuming and would end it earlier, so you go buying it more and more! ;-)\n\n9 of 10; Lost one point just because of a minor flaw in the projection aspect.  I would ignore and forgive the spraying trick in favor of such a wonderful creature!", "49": "A lot of controversy on this fragrance and after testing it out and thinking about whether to buy it for a few weeks i caved in and bought it! my first impression was honestly Wow i dig this smell and ive gotten many compliments with this one. Yea its a little stronger than most prefer but its a great compliment getter. I wouldnt say this fragrance is amazing but i feel it will be a very popular one in the years to come. I do love that i get 8+ hours when i spray this on. And honestly as long as you like it and it smells good to you that is all that matters. Cant please everyone. Always test it out for yourself because remember everyone's body chemistry is different. \n\nScent: 8/10\nlongevity: 10/10 \nprojection: 7/10\ncompliments: 10/10"}, "11": {"0": "This won\u2019t win me any popularity contests, but honestly Cloud is nearly identical to the dry down, and performs better than BR540 in terms of projection and lasting power. I detect it strongly for a good 4-5 hours, and can smell it on clothing literally days after wearing it. Cloud is a little sweeter, a little more rounded edges, and skips the medicinal opening of BR 540. Because of its opening, I\u2019d say that BR 540 is definitely more unisex. Cloud is linear, which to me is good news. I get right to the part I love about BR540 and skip the resiny note that I don\u2019t care for as much.  \nAgain, this will upset people, but I truly feel that when people pay a lot for something their brain will attach more value to it just because it\u2019s expensive. For example, it\u2019s my understanding that Baccarat Rouge is almost entirely synthetic, yet people assume the notes listed are ingredients to the perfume rather than (synthetic) aromachemicals adding up to what we\u2019re *supposed* to smell in the fragrance. Using \u201csynthetic\u201d as a pejorative when discussing perfume is just ridiculous and indicates that one probably doesn\u2019t really know much about the subject.  \nAs for the reviewers who agree Cloud is a dupe but are angry at Ariana Grande about it: LOL. Welcome to the wonderful world of gourmands. I\u2019m glad MFK created one you can enjoy. There are good ones all over if you\u2019re not too snotty to try them \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nNo hate to BR 540 or those who prefer it! It is enjoying its moment of hype right now and I\u2019m glad for it. Maybe it\u2019ll help more people stop clutching their bottles of Mitsouko and move into the 21st century. But if you\u2019re not a \u201cfrag head,\u201d \u201cperfumista,\u201d or SERIOUS collector and you just want a perfume that smells great and lasts? By all means, buy the Cloud!", "1": "I grew up poor. The first time I sprayed this on my wrist, I told my husband, \"This smells like rich girls in my high school.\" I don't know what it was that the rich girls were wearing in the late '90s, early 2000s, but that's the feeling it gave me at first.  \nUpon dry down, I could not stop sniffing my wrist. I've since gone through two purse sprayers and have already bought my third. I'm gonna have to cave and buy the large bottle. This is my new favorite scent.  \nIt's creamy and soft. It's sweet without being putrid. It's dark and luxurious. It's warm and inviting. It's a coconut cream hug wrapped in cashmere.", "2": "100% more enjoyable and crowd-pleasing than BR540. \nIn my opinion anyway. Even if you hate this scent, chances are 95% of people around you won't. \nFIELD REPORT: I tested this for 5-6 days before the pandemic got severe and got FAR MORE positive comments and compliments in the city than with BR540, mostly from 25-35 year old guys.  \nLong-story short: It's a more gourmand, sugary version of BR540. There is an uncanny resemblance. 'Cloud' leans a little on the synthetic side, but it's not bitter, cloying or offensive. Actually it's rather seductive. \nDOWNSIDE: Performance is not that great. Don't expect serious silage or longevity. Although most reviewers experienced great performance. \nVerdict: Try before you buy. Great for winter & fall for all occasions. Certified compliment-collector.  \nP.S. I see some salty BR540 fans in the reviews LOL.\nDon't take them seriously. Also stop shaming people for loving 'Cloud' over a $300 perfume. It doesn't matter if the fragrance you love is a dupe or low-cost, what's important is if it makes YOU happy.", "3": "When I first tried Baccarat Rouge 540, the marketing and hype was making me believe this would be an exquisitely crafted, top of the range, fit for royalty scent... And my honest response was \"Mmm, I like it... But it doesn't smell that much different to a celebrity scent.\" I felt embarrassed and tried to raise my opinion of it, since it seemed far more likely that I was just not sophisticated enough to appreciate the true depth of this beautiful work of art. But every time I tried it after, I just couldn't motivate myself to part with my cash for the enormous price tag. I said one day, cynically, to the sales assistant \"If this had the price of a celebrity scent, I'd get it.\"  \nWell!! Turns out I was right all along... Now I can have \"the real\" Baccarat Rouge 540.", "4": "I already did a rather long review on BR540, which I'm not a fan of but I really love this one. But it took a while. I'm going to try to explain the main difference here, because they are very much alike, but at the same time very different for one big reason. I'd also want to touch on the subject of fragrance snobbery because these two have definitely ruffled some feathers when people compare mainstream to niche - but that would fill up a book. So perhaps that will be for another time. \nAnyway.  \nCloud. By Ariana Grande. Or more precisely Clement Gavarry.\nLet's just get one thing out of the way first. The bottle. Let it be known that bottles are usually not something I care for all that much. But (and this is a big but). Who in their right mind adds this chunky and tacky plastic to the outfit of the scent? Seriously? In this day and age when we know better. The bottle itself could just have been shaped like a cloud if this was of such importance to the design team. The bottle itself, once saved from the plastic prison looks rather generic and not offensive. Apart from the fact that the name of the fragrance is nowhere to be seen once you remove it from the box. The cloud has \"Ariana Grande\" written on it and so does the bottle itself, but the actual name isn't there, not even on the bottom. Perhaps you are not supposed to throw the plastic monster out like I did and just \"get\" the name by looking at that bottle-in-cloud situation. Who knows. Out of all the fragrances I own, this is the only one that doesn't have the name of the fragrance on the bottle. It seems rather tacky to only have the name of Ms. Grande on the bottle, but then again, I'm definitely not the intended target group for any of her fragrances. There are for sure people out there that want her name to be prominent on what they own and use. I'm just not one of them.\nBottle rant over. \nNow on to the scent itself and the BR540 comparison. \nThis is very blatantly a rip off. There's no denying it. Does it smell exactly the same? No. Obviously not. Does it smell alike enough to trick people? Yes. \nThe note list for Cloud is completely different from BR540 but then again, notes listed do often not tell you much in regards to what the scent smells like. There's so much science that goes into fragrance making and even two different fragrances with almost identical note lists often smell nothing alike. These two are a good example of this. Both smell like there's a cloud around you (I have to give Ms. Grande's team a pat on the back for actually coming up with a name that's the perfect fit but in Mr. Kurkdjians defense, it would have been a bit peculiar of him to make his scent and name it \"Cloud\", and then stand firmly behind it at niche world Olympics saying \"yes yes, this is serious and niche, buy Cloud and smell rich\". No, that would never have worked). It creates a very pleasant and sweet aura around the wearer, it's this candy flossy, sugary sweet scent, that surprisingly isn't too sweet at the same time. Some fragrances actually smell like you overdosed on fruit that overdosed on sugar, but this stays far from that territory. Cloud is soft and fluffy and isn't loud or obnoxious. I wouldn't call it a sexy scent, rather a happy and cuddly one. I feel it suits many occasions and outfits, spring, summer, winter and fall. Day and night. It's versatile and easy to wear.  \nAnd now onto what's alike and what's not alike with those two. \nI don't like BR540. In fact it irritates me and even on others, I have to back away from them if they've been generous with the sprays. One thing that struck me trying them out was the medicinal smell that I smelled as soon as I took the cap off. When I got my sample of BR540 the whole box that was full of other samples reeked. I thought something had happened. It literally smells like iodine and my dentist's office, with some old band aids thrown in. The same thing happened when I smelled Cloud first. I thought the bottle had gone bad. But I could still smell something very pretty underneath. I've since then learned that the Saffron note in BR540 is most likely the reason for this because of it's medicinal qualities. There is no Saffron listed in Cloud and they might well be using something else with similar effects but after a couple of wearings, my nose grew to like it. I don't consider myself fully equipped to write a review unless I've worn a scent for a while so everything I write about has been worn a lot. The same goes for BR540. But there the Saffron overpowers everything to me.  \nAnd the biggest difference? Cloud has considerably less band aid smell compared to BR540 so if you dislike BR540 because of that, give Cloud a try. If you do a wrist test, with each scent on each wrist and compare them, yes you can tell the difference. BR540 is far more complicated and has some better quality ingredients. The sillage and longevity are also very different - Cloud doesn't announce its presence before you enter a room, it actually sits pretty close to you but the longevity on me is rather impressive, I can smell it on my wrist the following day until I take a shower. BR540 on the other hand is loud, you will not miss a person wearing it in the same room. I do not want to fill a room ever, I think that's not attractive and I want people only to be able to smell my perfume if they're standing close. So for that reason alone I'd choose Cloud. People looking for leaving a big trail behind them will not be happy with what Cloud offers.  \nSo, unless you have both on each wrist to compare, I don't think you can spot that big of a difference, and of course, one is a monster while the other is fairly tame.  \nOverall I'd say Cloud is a good fragrance for the price you pay. I'd even suggest that you'd get that one over BR540 if you don't care to fill up a room with your fragrance. I know a lot of niche lovers will hate on me for saying this but I stand by my opinion. A good fragrance is just a good fragrance, regardless of price. Although I'd love to see that ugly plastic cloud be gone, but you can't always get what you want and so in the recycling bin it goes. But that's my only complaint.", "5": "*sigh* This is the one that started my fragrance journey this year. Before a few months ago, I only had a signature scent. Two perfumes that I layered, day in and day out. Then I read an article from The Strategist about Cloud being one of the best perfumes of the year. I felt like I needed a change so I went straight to Ulta and picked up a small bottle. \n\nAt first sniff, I did not get it at all. It just smelled like burnt marshmallows. Why would burnt marshmallows get so much love? I was on the verge of returning it. But I just spent $40, and it was well loved so I decided to give it a try for a few more days. Well, after wearing it for a few days, I became obsessed. It was outside of my light musky comfort zone but I really liked it. It was a whole different vibe. It's still not my go-to but I really like it on cold days when I'm wearing a big sweater. \n\nBecause of Cloud, my perfume collection went from 2 to 14 in just a few months.\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 I haven't been able to focus on a book in months. Researching perfumes is my new hobby.  But it makes me happy, so I guess it's all good.\n\nUpdate 5/29/21: now that I'm further into my fragrance journey I realize why I didn't love this even though it's so popular. It's too sweet. It reminds me of Pink Sugar. And smelling that sweet just doesn't fit my personality. But I'm still grateful for the journey.

Otherwise, you'd probably get hit by fresh pear right in the conker like our friend \"Jimmy Choo\" - No hating on that perfume. We're all friends here. (Seriously, it's delightful).\n - Then the whipped cream and coconut brings me joy. It's so tooth-rottingly sweet, but comfortingly so. \n - Normally, I can't *stand* vanilla orchid, but it's been undetectable for me thus far, so...moving onwards...\n - For the finale - You want to make me happy; you send me home with a woodsy musk. \n\nGranted, I haven't smelt any other AG fragrances so I can't say if she's a (capital letters) Scent Legend or just hit a home-run on one perfume only, but this is happiness.\n\nI tend not to go for the overly sweet celebrity fragrance. I've spent the better part of my olfactory life avoiding them because they smell cheap, offensive, and...honestly, boring. Nowadays, I'm trying more because I want to expand the horizons here.\n\nBE WARNED>>> It's not all rainbows here, folks!\nDo not smell this direct from the bottle.

Now that I have smelled BR on a tester card I agree that these two are very, very similar! And it\u2018s interesting how the note list and the presentation are so different from each other. I wonder if I would have felt differently about the scent if I smelled Baccarat Rouge first, or if people who tried BR first would feel different about it if they smelled Cloud first. \n\nAnyways, I think Cloud fits quite well into Ariana\u2018s range of super sweet, cute and youthful fragrances. I like Moonlight and Sweet like Candy and I also like Cloud. It smells creamy and airy at the same time - if it was a real cloud, it would be a cloud of whipped cream, marshmallows and custard with sugared fruits. In the drydown I also get a very creamy coconut that makes me hungry for Ferrero Raffaello (one of my favorite sweets ever). \nThe lavender is only noticeable as a cool note in the beginning, that for some reason feels more minty than lavender-ish for me and somehow reminds me of the dentist, which sounds really weird mixed with all the sugary notes, but isn\u2018t actually half as bad as it sounds. \nIn BR I think this note is stronger and a bit metallic, so I guess I like Cloud better. \n\nIt\u2018s definitely one of the nicer celebrity fragrances, also not a weak scent at all. I\u2018m a bit sad that it doesn\u2018t come in another pompom bottle, I like those better than this one.", "8": "I had Cloud on one wrist, and Baccarat Rouge 540 on the other. The initial burst is identical. As the top notes die down, the main difference between the two is that BR540 is saltier and metallic, and Cloud is more floral. Thumbsup.

Constantly looking for scents that make me happy [also following a criteria that I have lol (e.g. something sweet, seductive, mysterious, enormous sillage/projection, etc.)] For now, I'd love to collect some gourmand fragrances :)\n\nAriana Grande's 'Cloud' is my first celebrity fragrance and currently my signature scent, it has given me a few compliments such as \"you smell so sweet\", \"I just wanna hug you\" and \"that scent gave me such a warm and cozy feeling\". I was quite pleased with this perfume since it was a blind buy and I based it from the reviews here. \n\nThe opening is kinda explosive and overpowering with pear and lavender but the dry down is just perfect, it emits something similar to a combination of vanilla/whipped cream/cotton candy. After a few hours, I could still smell that it's sweet but has a little bit of muskiness to it.\n\nIt smells so nostalgic, like a childhood scent I've come to know. It's so youthful and innocent. It reminds me of walking inside a big candy store or a bakery that sells a bountiful of sweet desserts. It also smells like freshly washed and ironed clothes ready to be worn. All in all, it just gives me a sense of warmth and coziness, I just love it.\n\nIt lasts for the whole day but as 5-6> hrs comes by it becomes soft and becomes a personal scent. The first few hours will get you noticed for sure and leaves a generous sweet scent trail that lingers. The only downside of using this perfume is that I have to spray a lot (I actually don't know if this is skin chemistry or something but when I overspray that's where I could smell it).

What I hadn't realised was that the bottle comes with a massive fucking plastic \"cloud\" cradle - I thought this was the display stand. I am so annoyed, now! Who the fuck adds huge hunks of plastic to their products in this day and age? Useless plastic that can't even be re-purposed? I am appalled, mainly at myself for not checking before buying. \n\nThe scent is lovely, though on my skin it doesn't have the deep, mellow warmth that I so love in BR540.\n\nUnfortunately, every time I spray this I will be reminded of that godawful hunk of white plastic it came with. I'd never buy this fragrance again, simply for that fact.\n\nMEH.\n\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nMAY 2019\n\nI walked into the changing room at gym the other day and I was hit in the face with the most delightful scent: probably my most favourite fragrance, Baccarat Rouge 540. The silage was immense - I picked it up feet away from the person who had just sprayed it on. I commented on it and she said it was Ariana Grande's new fragrance, Cloud. The similarity to BR540 is remarkable. Since I can't afford the BR540, I will be buying this for myself. I never would have thought I'd be so into gourmand scents, but I just love it and will experiment with layering it over my less-feminine fragrances. Can't wait to add this one to my collection.

LOVE IT. I'm hearing negatives from others but honestly it totally speaks to my inner 80's child (*cough..carebears, my little pony. . Cough*)\n\nPopped into Boots today (UK) and did a spritz, not expecting anything. First of it got a mild milky coconut with a delicate lavender. I walked around the shop and kept sniffing, as you do. Then I started getting the spun sugar note which seems to be the note that projects the most. I got a hint of the pear but only because I knew it was a top note and so was sniffing it out. The whole experience was a scent I've not had before. . And I love it. It's somehow cooling and warming, so I guess I'd wear this anytime of year. \nI have a sweet tooth, and so the sweet marshmallowy vibe is right up my street too. \n\nSo conclusion. .

But BR530 quick turns into a weird, rubbery - almost olive oil scent on my skin. It projects the sweet scent, but when I put my nose to my arm, it's rubber/olives. It stays that way through the drydown, but maybe gets a tiny bit sweeter again - but mostly just rubber. Cloud just continues to smell sweet.

Anyways. I sprayed the scent while I liked it and it didn\u2019t remind me of any of the other scents she has.

I didn't want to believe it, but I ordered a 100ml bottle because I was so curious after hearing all the hype and I was truly gobsmacked when I opened the cap and sprayed it on myself.

I always thought they did a fantastic job with the marketing and hype to drill up BR540 to be the greatest scent of all time..worthy of a \u00a3200 price tag, but underneath it all, I thought, without all that hype, this scent could easily be a celeb fragrance. \n\nI never buy celeb fragrances either, and I would have never thought about buying Cloud had it not been for the BR540 comparison. The only difference I would say is the sparkling quality that BR540 has, and that Cloud has a slightly sweeter note, but that fruit punchy, DNA of BR540...it's unmistakeable. If I smelled someone wearing this I would 100% assume it was BR540. \n\nI've been wearing it for a few hours (sillage going strong 4+ hours) and I keep getting whiffs of BR540 and forget I'm wearing Cloud. It really is mind boggling that the scent is spot on yet the notes are totally different. As another reviewer mentioned, the perfumers are the unsung heroes here....how they managed to pull this one off...well....I have no idea...but it's a miracle. \n\nIf you are in doubt, I let the fact that 50 other people and growing said this reminds them of BR540 in the section above, not to mention the numerous YouTube videos and comments here. People wouldn't be saying this just for a laugh, I know I'm not. I have no incentive to hype Cloud, only to spread the facts.\n\nOff to stock up on a few more 100ml bottles before a law suit goes down ha ha, I'm truly floored. Jk about the lawsuit, won't happen as they are completely different recipes.\n\nEDIT: 48 hours later, this perfume smells as though I've just sprayed it. Longevity on clothing is out of this world, almost a bit too much. I have no clue how some people have said this gives them an hour and then fades, I got minimum 9 hours yesterday out of this with people still asking what I was wearing at the end of the day.\n\nEDIT: This is the poor mans BR540. To an untrained nose, they may smell similar...but no...alas...I changed my mind....BR540 is superior.", "17": "Ariana Grande never disappoints when it comes to her fragrances. She's one of the very few celebrities who is actually hands on with the composition of her fragrances and doesn't just use it as a money grab.\n\nUpon the first spray, i immediately smelled the lavender, then followed the vanilla orchid, and it dries down with a creamy coconut and praline.\n\nCloud has a decent silage and moderate longevity. I get a good 4-5 hours on my skin, Which is okay. Like all of Ariana's fragrances, i think this is a safe blind buy. Even if you don't love it, you definitely won't hate it. \n\nThe 10ml rollerball and 10ml spray is only available as of now.\n\n\n*UPDATE RATING now that i have the full bottle* -07/19/2019\n\nScent: 10/10\nPackaging: 10/10\nPerfomance: 6/10", "18": "A very short description is that it smells like lightly coconut flavored whipped cream. The best word to describe it would be \u201dfluff\u201d. Like, if fluffy was a scent, this would be it for sure. The musk also adds nice warmth to it.", "19": "Despite trying and owning lots of perfumes, I think this is currently my #2. (Dior Hypnotic Poison EDT has edged it out of #1) \n\nIt's sweet but not too sweet. There is some kind of little note that pulls masculine and it makes this fragrance perfect and addicting.\n\nNot only do I love wearing it, when I walk up to my vanity, I often smell something that draws me in. I've realized it's this perfume. Dozens of perfumes, lots of lotions, and this is the one that grabs me every single time.\n\nI'm a grown woman and sure, it's a little embarrassing when someone compliments my perfume and I have to admit it's Ariana Grande perfume. Haha. But I don't care. It smells great! \n\nPro Tip! The stupid plastic cloud it comes set in... Take that piece of junk off. The nasty plastic smell goes away and you can actually hold the bottle to spray it properly.", "20": "Major mall vibes from this one, like a Claire\u2019s/Limited Too/Bath&Body Works sweet scent from the late 90\u2019s/early 00\u2019s. This is a positive for me. Very cute and fluffy with presentation to match. The bottle lifts out of the cloud base.\n\nEdited to add:\nDry down has a pleasant masculine edge.", "21": "Just got this today & I\u2019m in love! This is sweet, creamy, lavender-y goodness on me! I find the initial spray to be a bit sharp with a blast of alcohol for a few seconds before starting to settle & the whipped cream, coconut, praline, and a hint of lavender & bergamot notes present themselves. I find this fragrance to be fairly linear except the dry down seems to be a bit sweeter & a bit cologne like (which I believe may be from the lavender). I find it to have a borderline heavy sillage within the first hour of spraying it before becoming moderate, and it has about a 6 hour longevity on me which I think is pretty good. This smells \u201cexpensive\u201d to me, and I find it pretty unisex, especially in the dry down. I blind bought the 1 oz gift set from Walmart for $19.99 to test it out, & will definitely be purchasing the 3.4 oz! Love this!\n\nEdit: I purchased samples of BR540 & the Extrait, & the initial spray & dry down of BR540, & the deep dry down of the Extrait smell almost IDENTICAL to Cloud. So much so that when I went to my hair appointment, the receptionist complimented my fragrance & asked if I was wearing Ariana Grande Cloud! However, I will say that the biggest difference is the sillage. BR540 has a much heavier sillage than Cloud. 3 sprays and it\u2019s beast mode! With Cloud, I\u2019m more heavy handed (avid over sprayer here, lol) 8-10 sprays for moderate sillage, double for BR540 sillage, but since it\u2019s relatively inexpensive, I don\u2019t mind over spraying. I\u2019d say that Cloud & the Extrait are similar in sillage. However, both BR540 & the Extrait are more long lasting than Cloud (as should be expected given the price tags). Owning Cloud, I don\u2019t feel as if I need to fork over the coins for BR540 or the Extrait at the moment. I may consider purchasing BR540 in the future for its grandiose sillage, lol.", "22": "As much as I hate to admit it this smells almost identical to MFK Baccarat Rogue 540. Sweet, unisex and addicting.", "23": "It\u2019s definitely fruity and sweet, but I honestly get more compliments when I wear this fragrance than I do from any other scent I own. Also, I\u2019m a sucker for the bottle. It\u2019s delicious, bright, and airy. Silage and performance for me are both strong - it lasts the whole day and I can constantly smell whiffs of it on me as I go throughout the day.", "24": "I love this frag AND I love MFK BR540.  And yes.  Just like everyone says....there are similarities but.... \n\nI would say they are in the same molecular family but not super close.  \n\nThere is a slight masculine flair to cloud upon first spray and dries down to a modern marshmallowy, coconutty, sweet yet kinda earthy aroma.  The dry down is different from the opening but I wouldn't say it's eons away.  It reminds me of something a tomboy would wear if she was looking for something sweet but nothing gourmand, fruity, flowery, or beachy.  If that makes sense. \n\nBR540 holds more of those masculine, woody, earthy, balsamic notes mixed with a very noticeable, but not loud candy floss smell.  Definitely smells very molecular but expensive.\n\nThey both live up to the hype that their respective fans place on them.\n\nI would say this....unless you are a fragrance snob....if you LOVE one then you will definitely, at the very least, LIKE the other.\n\n(I actually think \"in the stars\" by BBW smells more similar to BR540 than cloud)", "25": "This is by far Ariana's best fragrance. I honestly tend to rather collect fragrances if I like a celebrity as on average celebrity fragrances are not consistently great and come and go though there are many I like, I just find I would buy a fragrance if I was so so about it because I collect for instance J-Lo fragrances. Unfortunately in this day and age I think we have passed the heights of the celebrity perfume craze as they tend to date by popular opinion and people want the brand new thing, meaning if you like one that isn't huge such as Britney Fantasy it dissappears off the shelves quickly and we move on to the next one. That is why I was so surprised by Ari's Cloud fragrance. It is not another run of the mill fruity sweet sugar overload, it is well constructed, layered, and complex. I love the initial blast which is almost masculine but in a good way of course, like a gentle cologne, but that falls to the background and the softer but sweeter notes take over. I love the sort of sweet yet soft almost blueberry / lavender vibe and it really does make you think of clouds, it has that peaceful vibe to it. I usually like to suggest a perfume it smells like but I can't think of one, I would say if you are blind buying, it is like a small amount of I love love, mixed with lavender and blueberry's, and then I guess something reminiscent of the original Ari perfume (sweet) and mixed together to form a really beautiful classy fragrance that does not smell like a celebrity perfume! It is really sexy in my opinion too and I feel feminine and confident wearing it. Definitely a nice break from the vanilla bombs around and I hope it encourages other celebrities to focus on quality over quantity and rather than ending the run of celebrity perfumes I hope Cloud brings life back in to celebrity fragrances and creating classics that last. I read comparisons to Baccarat Rouge which I have been wanting for years! I think I need to go try Baccarat at the perfume store which I don't get to often as I don't really see the similarity to Cloud. When I next try it I will give my opinion but at the moment my recollection is that it is a rich floriental like Tom Ford Jasmine Rouge? I will try it again though. I highly recommend Cloud it's so beautiful and I love the kitschy bottle too.", "26": "I love this scent and was so pleasantly surprised by it! To me it smells like a girl's night out with your best friend. Sitting at a table sharing a decadent dessert; a caramel pear tart topped with fresh whipped cream while sipping sugar rimmed lemon drop martinis. This scent lasts all day long, especially on my clothes. It's perfect for the brisk fall weather but I'll be wearing it all year!", "27": "So I am one more voice in that huge choir that praises Grande's Cloud. It is utterly beautiful on my skin. I get a lot of lavender and whipped cream. The coconut is vague, as is the musk. The praline is super-sweet - which I love. Also, the lavender (it really smells like shaving foam, as others have commented) counterpoints the sugar in a charming way. \nCloud has the classically male and classically female traits combined in one perfume, much like Mugler's Angel. I love that. \n\nConcerning the Baccarat Rouge 540 question that seems to have acquired a religious dimension on this forum: Yes, I clearly see the similarity. Baccarat Rouge 540 was sweeter on my skin, though, and it gave me the illusion of hotness, while Cloud is somewhat cool on me.  \n\nAs strong and long-lasting as most Mugler or Tom Ford scents. Love, love, love. Really, why should I resist? Love, love, love.", "28": "I'm not a fan of Ariana Grande, and I'm not a huge fan of the bottle design, however I'm totally digging the juice inside. To me this smells like marshmallow (maybe from the whip cream note?) and burnt sugar with praline and coconut, and I REALLY enjoy it--especially for colder months! It does have a synthetic vibe to it, but I honestly don't mind it in this fragrance...and it think actually adds to it and keeps it from being too sweet. This lasts all day on me, and has moderate sillage. I couldn't imagine wearing this in the warmer months, as it would be too cloying and sweet. This is a great fragrance, for the price; picked mine up at Ulta.\n\nAlso, this has some commonalities w/ Scandalous by Victoria's Secret. The warm praline is evident in both. They are not dupes, but there is a similar vibe between the two.", "29": "Lowkey I own a bucket of BR540 -and- Cloud. Guess which one I wear more? Yup! This!\n\nLook man, I have enough B540 to last me a lifetime so long as I'm wise about it, but Cloud is easier to wear every day. It's a bit lighter and fluffier, and while it smells super similar, I wouldn't say it's exactly the same. And that's a good thing, because 540 punches people in the face if you wear a single spritz. And that doesn't bode well for these hot ass California summers, though it may be useful now that no one can smell anything due to COVID. 'Cept the folks who wear their mask -not- over their nose????\n\nWait, you know what, I should just wear something really offensive when I go out, then maybe they'll pull it up.\n\nNot BR540 or Cloud though, they both smell good.", "30": "I know absolutely nothing about Ariana Grande, but I was curious about this fragrance after reading some positive reviews.  I tested it at Ulta and it is so good!  I love gourmand fragrances in the winter.  This is sweet and dreamy.  Fluffy whipped cream, milky coconut, nutty chocolate, and musk.  The lavender gives it a cleansing freshness too.  Needless to say, I left the store with a bottle!  Loving it!", "31": "I just had to know! Right, on the merits of the frag alone, sans 540 comparisons, this is delicious! \n\nOn paper, the lavender, pear, bergamot and orchid jump right off. Like a sweet candy as others have said. It smells literally like very ripe, juicy pear from the nozzle itself (do this away from that plastic cloud which definitely has a smell--yeesh). It seems to stay fresh and sweet on paper.\n\nOn the skin, the same array of notes on the top but the whipped cream and coconut starts creeping in more and more after 10-20min. The lavender is still hanging around, which I enjoy! The musk is not intense and the praline + woods gives depth to the coconut/whipped cream sweetness. To apply tactile traits to a smell: it really feels cloud-like. Sweet, airy and fluffy but not at all linear (which may be disappointing for some).\n\nThe longevity is something else for a celebrity scent: I applied 5 sprays at 3pm and woke up to a sweet, woody, musky skin scent at 8am the next morning. Impressive!\n\nI feel like you could wear this for day or night in most circumstances (obviously, wear what you want when you want; no policing here). It is a little synthetic but I don\u2019t mind that at all\u2014I\u2019ve got more than enough natural florals, woods, gourmands, etc. In addition to being pretty, Cloud is also comforting: like aromatherapy that passes for pleasing perfume. \n\nWould definitely recommend and I think the price makes it a safe blind buy.", "32": "This isn\u2019t as sweet as I was expecting it to be. I\u2019m getting a lot of mild cream, lavender, and wood. This is more elegant than the notes or packaging would lead you to believe. It\u2019s mild, nutty, even soapy from the lavender and definitely woody. It has a little bit of that burnt wood feeling that BR 540 has. At times I\u2019m anosmic to it. But the when I\u2019m not I really like it. This is a bit minimalistic. I think this is one of those fragrances that you have to train your nose to. It might have some synthetics that are a bit hard to get to the heart of. I happen to really like minimalistic fragrances. I happen to really like a white T shirt smell or Iso E and ambroxan. I think they can be quite sexy.\n\nOkay it\u2019s been about 4 hours at least since I tried this out on my skin. After about an hour and a half the sweeter notes come out in this. It\u2019s incredibly milky, nutty, smooth and sweet in a minimal body spray way. The opening is very similar to BR540 but as it dries down it goes in a different direction.\n\nOkay I\u2019m just going to say it... BR540 is great but unless you get the BR 540 extrait this is a baby hair away from being as good as BR edp.  In fact in some ways I like this more.", "33": "I had a travel size of Baccarat Rouge 540, and  I finished it last week. Today I went for a summer vacation fragrance search, and I saw the \"famous\" Cloud of Ariana Grande. I don't know how it is possible because these guys listed completely different notes of Baccarat but the liquid of Cloud it is just the same. God! I love this smell (well the \"original\" one of Baccarat). Cloud has that same opening, maybe just a hint sweeter and after a 10 minutes it is that salty ambergris note which I love. I think it perfect blend between sweet and salty, I am sniffing my arm constantly.\n\nP.S \nThe bottle is cheap looking, and kind of funny, nothing \"cloudy\" in the perfume, I don't know why decide to go with this awful bottle. \n\nThe smell is amazing!\n\nP.S\nAfter 1 week of wearing \"Cloud| I cannot stand it anymore, that was it. I get only whip cream, some kind of cake cream I want to cut my arm off.", "34": "This perfume was such a sweet little surprise, I love it!\n\nI recently sprayed it on me while browsing in Kohls.  I'm not gonna lie, I thought the bottle was adorable and I said  to myself, let me give this a try.  I really liked it right away.  I kept thinking about it and came face to face with it again in Ulta and had to buy it.  \n\nThis perfume is both soft and sweet.  I love how you get the sweet notes of cream and a hint of coconut, but you also get a bit of the pear and lime.  It's the type of scent that when someone smells it, they might not be able to pick out the notes and say, \"hey you smell like cream and coconut\", but instead it's the type of fragrance that when someone smells it they'll instantly say \"That's so pretty, what is that?\".  I love how like her other scents it maintains a level of sweetness, but this one is very soft and delicate.  It's not screamingly sweet to the point of screeching.  It's just the right balance of soft and sweet.  The name fits perfectly.\n\nAs far as lasting power, I find it doesn't necessarily stay directly on my skin as long as I'd like, but it does kind of create an aura of the scent around me if that makes sense.  So even if I don't directly smell it on my wrist, I feel like I still smell like it overall.  In conclusion, this is a lovely scent and I'm super pleased with it!  I like the other perfumes in her line (the ones I have smelled), but this seems to be my favorite from her at the moment.", "35": "It is just too plastic for my taste.\n\nYes, it does have that Baccarat Rouge vibe, and if you are really on a budget, I would still recommend it, but for my excessive collection (180+ full bottles) this is a like and not love.\n\ncreamy marschmallow-vanillary burned sugar scent, very girly.", "36": "Cloud is a massive molecule based fragrance and plays peekaboo during the day. I havent smelled baccarat rouge yet, but to me this resembles the scandinavian fragrance brand zarko perfumes, in particular pink molecule. The creamy molecule is lovely. \nAlso to my nose, this is nothing like burberry her, that one is heavy raspberry in the opening and is not creamy. \nSillage in cloud depends on body heat imo. Warming up it projects more. Longevity is 7-8 h.\nSweet and creamy with a amber like trail.", "37": "I just bought this perfume recently but I got the travel size. My first impression is wow yummy :) Marshmallows with a little bit of lavender is what this smells like. It's delicious. \n\nPeople say it smells plastic but to my nose i dont smell that at all. \n\nI dont like celebrity perfumes much. They can smell good but they smell cheap but this one is amazing and I can't stop smelling myself. First time in my life where I became so crazy obsessed with a fragrance. I'm also 28 btw.\n\nYummy marshmallows :)  and the sillage seems decent from my experience and lasts pretty well.\n\nI am IN LOVE. One of the best smelling fragrances ever. I already bought a back up bottle.  Already had a few compliments:) gentle and long lasting <3\n\nUpdate: my husband is the pickiest man when it comes to fragrances,  he loves this and told me it's an easy 9 out of 10 for him.

I wanted to test it because it has been compared to an expensive niche perfume and many women seem to like it a lot.\n\nCloud smells very soft and moderately sweet, but there is a crispy note that gives some spark to the fluffiness, makes the scent more vibrant and interesting.\nI can easily imagine myself wearing this on a summer holiday.", "39": "I'm a mad, large, weight lifting guy and I consider Fahrenheit blue - and by it I mean I wear it anywhere and anytime I want, including friend's wedding in the middle of August.\n\nThis is a fragrance nobody's gonna tell me I can't wear.

I'd like it to lat and project more though.", "40": "This is exactly how I imagine a cloud to smell like, if that makes any sense at all.\n\nLight, innocent, whimsical, sweet and mysterious. \n\nOpening spray for me is fluffy whipped cream/marshmallow and fresh coconut shavings, followed by something nutty and airy, almost like how pixie dust would smell. It's like eating marshmallows while wearing clean clothes that were washed in lavender scented soap.  \n\nSuper comforting and just all around pleasing to the senses. I really like the smooth praline and almond dry down. It kind of brings me back down to Earth from my heavenly scented cloud of sweetness! For me, the opening is bright and playful yet the dry down is warming and soothing. \n\nIs it groundbreaking? No, probably not. I've never had anything in my collection that smells like this though, so I really do like it and will enjoy it on days where I want to feel youthful and playful. \n\nA perfect perfume for Spring.", "41": "I was very pleasantly surprised with this perfume. I own all of the other Ariana Grande perfumes because they are light and sweet but they have 0 staying power. On the other hand, Cloud is sweet, a bit more mature and different than her other perfumes and the staying power is fantastic. Totally recommend.", "42": "Sprayed in at Ulta on my wrists - lasted all day and I could still smell marshmallows in the evening. Very pretty packaging and the scent is warm and cozy.

I hate it, it smells like a damp storage room.. I don\u2019t know what makes that smell, is it the lavender? \nBut, oh but, 15 minutes later I\u2019m surrounded by a cozy creamy milky coconut scent i can\u2019t help but sniffing myself constantly and wanting to spray more..\nAnd then I sprayed some more and the annoying opening scent reappear then I got mad at myself for doing that \ud83d\ude01\n\nUpdate: it\u2019s the bergamot! I\u2019m not a fan of citrus and this reminds me of a lime scented bug spray \n\nBut the dry down is so gorgeous and it last for about 4 hours on me, not as beast as I hope for, but overall I\u2019m satisfied \n\nAnd for the resemblance with baccarat rogue, I do smell something similar, but only when sniffing briefly like when someone passes by, but when I sniff closely cloud is more sweet while BR is more ambery and heavy", "44": "This perfume finally grows on me and I'm in love! My first wear was a disaster because I overspray, all I could smell was some cheap sweet greasy buttery scent that last forever, still moderate strong projection after 10 hours! My second wear was a world of difference, a little goes a long way and I smell and appreciate the notes better. The perfume smells like burnt marshmallows and ice cream with a bit of lavender. Very fun and cozy, something I will wear in cold weather, people around me love the smell. The performance is amazing and one good spray is enough for me.\n\nThe kitsch bottle is cute, but the cap is some cheap plastic and doesn't hold the bottle at all, not a deal breaker, just not high quality.\n\nI didn't know what to think, but I'm happy with my blind buy now, I love the juice and I'm curious to try other Ariana Grande fragrances.", "45": "This is SO delicious, I bought a sample of this and I\u2019m in Love.

It takes away some the sweetness so it\u2019s not overbearing. \nPerformance is beast, both sillage and longevity, I wouldn\u2019t spray more than 4 sprays of this and I would only wear this in the cold weather. Would be a really good bedtime scent too. \nDefinitely going to ask for a full bottle for Christmas!!\n\n\nEdit: ended up decluttering because my nose decided to start hating coconut one day. Purchased Burberry her for the Bacarrat vibe instead.", "46": "Okay so, I like to wear a fragrance for at minimum 2 days before I leave a review. For this one, I waited a full week and I think I've gathered some valuable data:\n\n1. People love this scent. Major crowd pleaser and draws compliments. People will tell you that you smell great and ask you what you're wearing. \n\n2. This scent lasts forever on clothes and pretty well on skin. 12+ hours on clothes, 5 hours on skin. This scent does not need to be reapplied and you don't need to bring a travel size with you anywhere, which is awesome and super convenient. \n\n3. The strongest note in this is vanilla. Anytime I ask someone what they smell on me, they say they smell vanilla. \n\n4. It projects better in colder weather so if you wear it in air conditioning or winter, this will grab more attention than if you're wearing it in hot 80 degree weather outdoors. \n\n5. The notes I smell the most in order: whipped cream, vanilla, coconut. \n\nOverall, this is a fantastic/ unique celebrity scent. It has some resemblances to BR540 but I think Cloud has a more flirty, fun personality. I think for the price and for how much people love this scent, it's a safe blind buy. If you don't love it personally, I'm sure someone in your family will and you can give it to them.", "47": "This is the weirdest fragrance I have ever felt a need to buy in my scent journey so far and it plays games with my nose like crazy.\n\nI was intrigued because of all of the comparisons to BR540. I do not own, nor have I ever smelled BR540, but I wanted to smell what it might be close to. I am curious about otherworldly expensive fragrances, but since I don't have the immediate budget for them, I like to sample cheapie dupes.\n\nThe first time I smelled Cloud, I really liked it. It smelled like nothing I had ever smelled before, nor like anything in my mostly floral collection. But just like that...it was GONE! I was like...what the heck???? I assumed my skin just didn't love it. So I went home from fragrance testing and, as soon as I hit the door, my husband asked me what I was wearing and told me he LOVED it. I kept smelling myself and smelling myself, but I could not smell a darn thing.\n\nHe wanted to see what it smelled like in person, so we both went to Ulta and I sprayed it on. He LOOOOOOOVED it and wanted me to purchase on the spot. I could barely smell anything. Just the alcohol and maybe a trace of coconut on the initial spritz. On the dry down? Next to nothing. \n\nI went home without purchasing and was annoyed. Guessing I was one of those people who are anosmic to Cloud. I woke up this morning to a delightful fragrance on my sleeve. I could smell it again!!!! I ran out to Ulta for a 3rd time in two days and tested it AGAIN! This time I could smell it initially, but then it faded off again and I could only really smell the mix of fragrances in the fragrance section. Disappointed, I put down the gift set I had intended to buy and left the store. I was walking to my car when I got a whiff. I could smell it again! This time I could REALLY smell it all over my hand and sleeve. Despite it being like nothing I already own, I find that I really enjoy the scent.\n\nTo me, I get the softness of the creamy whipped cream and just the barest hint of coconut.  For being a celeb fragrance targeted at younger girls and women, I find this fragrance to be elegant, soft, but also present (when I can smell it). It lacks \"deepness\" to me of some higher end gourmands that I have smelled, but that's not really a bad thing. It is unique and smells good, which is what I really look for. I ordered some off of Fragrancenet. I decided that it is a must in my collection.", "48": "I don't even care, I think the packaging is adorable! It reminds me of a Mario cloud \ud83e\udd17\n\nCloud is synthetic and whimsical, with some very understated sexiness. I really think it bears a striking resemblance to In The Stars. It's a wafting, elusive scent that probably contains the same artificial \"airy-ness\" constituents. It's much, much sweeter than In The Stars though (actually, ITS is scarcely sweet at all). Whatever it is, the particular trait is addictive for me and is becoming something I lean toward, I'd love to try more perfumes with this dynamic.\n\nI love how this almost disappates for 10 minutes, only to reappear suddenly in a poof of fragrance.\n\nIt has a coconut cream/whipped cream undertone. Sometimes I really don't love coconut, but this is really rich without being heavy or cloying. I get some cookie without overwhelming vanilla too. It's not listed, but I swear I smell strawberries! It has a light touch of floral, nothing overly flowery or powdery.\n\nIt settles into a beautiful, youthful musk. I'm in love with the dry down, I could die and be buried in it happily.\n\nSometimes I think of personality types with frags; this INFP. It's seemingly sweet and almost juvenile, but slams you with depth and potency as time passes by...it's also stubborn and the longevity is ridiculous.", "49": "This perfume checks every mark. Cloud kicked off the 540 duplication phase (540 came out before all of these). And truly, if it weren\u2019t for Cloud\u2019s accessible price point, I\u2019m not sure baccarat would have gotten the traction it did. Cloud made everyone want that DNA. Even a step above itself. My gosh it lasts forever and the scent trail is so thick people trip over it. I get the whipped cream lactonic quality. The masculine edge that makes you feel like a volunteer prisoner. The coconut, a completely new kind because I don\u2019t think beach or cooking lol...\nIt\u2019s simply delicious. I don\u2019t care if I smell like my 15 year old niece. \nThe difference is I can afford the BR540 too..."}, "12": {"0": "HOLY. SHIT. and I stress the Holy. This is the first fragrance where I have literally been mesmerized. I had smelled GIT by Creed. Wasnt impressed for the price. Millesime Imperial, which I like a lot, but not for the price. After those two I just wrote off the Creed House as overpriced and not worth the products produced. However, I was strolling through Neiman Marcus and gave this one a try in attempts to crush the what I was certain to be hype. I was so taken aback I shouted \"My God\" out loud in the store. I have NEVER smelled anything quite like this. Never. So incredibly unique. Inspired by Napoleon? I believe it. It smells like power. I understand that is an obnoxious statement but congruent with my reaction and the perfume's inspiration. \nUp top: pineapple. and fresh cut, real, not synthetic pineapple. I detect a hint of black currant. \nMiddle: starts to get smokey. I detect birch all the way. Birch and patchouli with a hint of rose. God it is so wonderful. \nBase: an oakmoss/leather base. It says leather is not a note but I think the oakmoss/musk/fading fruits make some type of leather accord. Divine. Literally. \nLongevity: I got 9 hours on my skin and it was projecting for 5-6. \nI walked out of Neiman Marcus with Aventus on my hand, to check it with my chemistry, to meet my gf in the hair salon. I walked into a wall of compliments. Every woman in the salon was in awe. Walk out of the salon, a male stranger passes, walks back to me and taps me on the shoulder to ask what cologne I was wearing. That has never happened in my life. I intend to purchase the 4.0oz after my next pay period as well as the shave balm. Before smelling Aventus I would have thought I was outside of my mind to purchase a $300 fragrance. But I believe it is because I know my search for my perfect/signature scent is over. I will always have a few staples in the collection; Fahrenheit, Encre Noire, Dior Homme Intense for romantic evenings. But I can never see myself liking anything more, or feeling anything suits who I am better than Aventus. And I must say, it is a beautiful thing. This is the best fragrance I have EVER smelled. Breathtakingly beautiful and seductively powerful.", "1": "Ah, Aventus\u2026 Not even Creed's laughably inflated prices could stop you from becoming a bestseller, even beyond the usual demographic of niche aficionados. For years, Creed fans used to look down on the peasants wearing Cool Water (considered a dumbed-down version of their beloved Green Irish Tweed). Now they've been somewhat undercut, as Johnny Cargopants and his fratbro entourage have forsaken their Davidoff and started touring the clubs with a cloud of Aventus trailing behind them.  \nSince there's not much I could add to describe the fragrance itself, I feel I should instead answer some of the more pressing questions I've come across on the BN Aventus subforums. \n1. Yes, Aventus is a chick magnet. You'll be the center of attention at any bar or club. Nevermind the two dozen other dudes around you who are also doused in pineapple. They're probably wearing that self-made knockoff recipe of Club de Nuit Intense and apple soda you saw on Youtube (which you totally didn't try). You'll be way cooler, wearing the real thing and sipping on the Snapple juicebox you brought from home. \n2. There's plenty of websites that sell Aventus at a discount (look for those which have authentic Ray-Bans at 90% off). But the cheapest way to get it is the so-called \"unlimited pre-evening trial\". How it works: Hit your favourite Sephora 5 minutes before closing time, and tell them you wanna \u201ctry\u201d Aventus. If you\u2019re afraid the saleslady is onto you (because she sees you coming in every Friday evening before you hit the clubs), try buttoning your shirt and tucking in your chest hair.  \n3. On the subject of dosage: If you still blow below the legal limit after dousing your body in pineapple-scented alcohol, you haven\u2019t sprayed enough. Go back in and tell the saleslady you accidentally sprayed the wrong tester. Have your friend Johnny stand next to you, so she\u2019ll think the miasma of tropical fruit is emanating from his slightly damp cargo pants.  \n4. Yes, Aventus is indeed the most original fragrance to come along in years. Every other fruity, smoky or woody fragrance thereafter has obviously been inspired by it, so make sure to mention that in your reviews of those fragrances. It even applies to older scents of those types, because Aventus has clearly outclassed them. For extra points, bring that up when discussing a classic that\u2019s known to have its own rabidly devoted fanbase (try Guerlain\u2019s Mitsouko). \n5. A true Aventus man knows his batch codes, and can recommend the right batch for any occasion. Hot date at your favourite club? Try one of the smokier batches from way back (2011). Fun day at the mall with your bros, shopping for new cargo pants? One of the fruitier batches will put you in the right mood. When in doubt, consult the experts who stash vintage bottles and regularly compare them to current batches. Rumour has it that the juice people spit into buckets at Aventus tastings is used as the base for Dior\u2019s Sauvage.  \nAventus is love. Aventus is life. Long live Aventus.", "2": "There is a lot of talk about Creed Aventus and the infamous batch variations and reformulations (?).\nFirst of all, let me say that I am wearing Aventus since 2015 and have owned and used 4 different bottles over the past 5 years. I just finished my older bottle this week, a vintage 2013 batch (13W01), I have used a 2015 one (don't know because I didn't care for the batches back then), a 16E01 (2016), a 50ml bottle of 17R01 (my favourite) and have a 20E01N sitting as a backup for a year now.\nI love them all! Yes they do smell SLIGHTLY different. You can DEFINITELY notice it, altough in the air they basically smell the same, like Aventus of course! But, to me, that's one of the most interesting and magical things of Aventus. It has a life of it's own. You will find 3 different \"sides\" of Aventus: you have the SMOKY side; the BALANCED batches; and the FRUITY side.\nA SMOKY batch will have stronger notes of birch and musk, the woody an leather accords are more prounced in those batches and it will feel heavier, more dense, smokier .. that's what a smoky Aventus is. With that density usually comes a little more longevity. That more pronounced leather accord from those batches is where people get the similarities with Mancera's Cedrat Boise from (not all Aventus have that - it is subtle though ..).\nThe BALANCED batches are great to my nose. Exactly what the name suggests, a more balanced composition where none it's different sides shout louder. From my experience the batches that are well balanced have the strongest projection and a really beautiful scent trail and sillage. The vanilla in the drydown is to die for. Really beautiful.\nA FRUITIER batch is usually not as base notes dense as the others and have a brighter, fresher and frutier opening. It was only when I got one of these batches that I could clearly smell the apple and the bergamot. For the people who love freshies this is the perfect type of Aventus batch for you. The opening is so uplifting! I feel that the fruitier batches project really well for the first hours but then sit closer to the skin. Even with those I always get at least 8h longevity with Aventus (YES, even the newer 2020 batch).\nWith all being said, please bear in mind that the same batch can also smell and performe differently with diffent Seasons of the year, temperatures, humidity, and of course in different skins.\nThis is how Aventus as ALWAYS been through the years. It is a masterpiece fragrance. All those batch variations are completely normal and to be expected with the natural raw materials that the house of Creed is known for using. It can be off putting, of course, sometimes you don't know what you get. But fortunately, you can easily buy samples to try and test them first. And as I said, IT'S ALL AVENTUS. Those are small nuances, noticeable (sure) but minor, an untrained nose won't pick it up most of the times.\nWhat I would like to clarify here is the following: Aventus is as good now as with the older bottles. Please don't get caught into this batch variation rabbit hole. The performance is still there, the smell is the same (with the same batch variations), the quality of the ingredients is the same, the pacaking changes but only minor things, sprayer is great, it's all Aventus as we know it. What DID change is the price that is sky rocketing nowadays and that is what is pissing people off. If it's worth it, is up to you! If you look careful online you can find stores that sell the 50ml for arround 150-60 euros and the 100ml for 200 euros (that is acceptable for me). It's Aventus, it's pricey. We know that.\nConcluding, I finished my 2013 bottle this week and had a new 2020 bottle that I used for a week everyday and then let rest in the box for a whole year! AFTER that MACERATION time, I sprayed the 2013 batch on one hand and the 2020 on the other. The 2013 leans to the smokier side, and the 2020 batch is frutier. Both smell great like Aventus! 2020 lasted 12h on my skin and the 2013 lasted an extra hour and a half (total of 13,5 hours). The 2020 one projected more strongly for the first 3 to 4 hours mark and then became closer to the skin. The 2013 one sat closer to the skin during the wearing. I was very pleased with that. After that I gave them a full day wear and realized I like the new 2020 batch more then my prized vintage bottle. With all the batches from the bottles I have owned (and also bought a LOT of samples/decants along the years to try) my Aventus experience was always very similar: 8,5 to 14h of longevity (usually 12h); strong projection for the first 3 hours and always THAT AVENTUS DNA through years of wearing it. Please keep in mind that Creed fragrances are often linked with cases olfactory fatigue, specially Aventus. I fell that happening. It's not an easy fragrance to test, so if you are testing it don't keep trying to smell it all of the time and ask for other people to smell it. YOU WILL BE SURPRISED. Also notice that YOU CAN'T really compare a vintage older bottle to a brand new fresh one. It didn't have the time to age. And even if you leave it still macerating, you still can't compare bottle because of different maceration time. To make things worse with older bottles they can start going bad (specially the top notes). For sure they WILL go bad, it's just a matter of time. If you're looking for a good LAUGH look in forums for old threads about Creed batch variations. The batches people PRAISE NOW were also being THRASHED BACK THEN. Really, go look for it. It's a mind trap. The previous one is always better .. the vintage one, the unobtainable one is always be the holy grail .. \"my neighbour's wife is better than mine\" .. Come on, we are better than that.\nIN SUMMARY\nAVENTUS IS STILL AVENTUS! The quality, smell and performance are still there. Maceration time is a real thing and will bring the performance up. Test if for yourself if you can. The only problem with the actual Aventus is the price (it's going up!) but you can still find it new in stores for 200 euros for a 100ml bottle. That's an acceptable deal IMO. PLEASE save your self some time and money and don't go chasing for \"magical\" vintage or older bottles, clones or whatever. You want Aventus? It's NOT discontinued. It's up for sale. Just grab one. It's the same Aventus we love. Fragrances are to be worn, experienced, felt. If you love and want Aventus, just get it. I'ts a beautiful fragrance.", "3": "Aventus is a fragrance I always hated for years before even smelling it simply because of how much ridiculous hype it gets. Little did I know...it was fully worth the hype it got. \nWhen I finally decided to test it out, I was approaching it with a \u201cI know I\u2019ll hate this\u201d mentality. However, I have caught myself sniffing my arm, clothes, and sprayer more times than I\u2019d ever like to admit. \nAnd eventually, I just couldn\u2019t resist, and pulled the trigger. And I was not disappointed one bit. From something I tried so hard to despise, to something I proudly call \u201cmy favorite fragrance of all time\u201d. \nIt is cloned to death, but no matter how good a clone is, nothing smells like Creed Aventus.  \nWhile yes there is the batch-syndrome that Creed is well known for, I have tried over 5 different batches. Some where fruitier, some where smokier, but it does not matter. They are all very much the one and only Aventus. \nMy main bottle is the infamous 2019 batch which enthusiast like to bash on, yet it still smells exceptional, and I actually prefer this newer batch over some of the older ones because it\u2019s more balanced. But again, all Aventus are Aventus. \nPeople in the fragrance community say that the scent profile is too popular, however, I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding here; the scent profile is too popular IN the fragrance community, but outside of it, barley anyone knows what Aventus is or what it smells like. And everyone I asked to try it out had their minds blown. \nThe one word that sums up everything about Aventus is: King. \n11/10, Legendary.", "4": "This will get you compliments. From EVERYBODY. Random strangers will compliment you. Animals will compliment you. Insects will chirp as you pass by. You will turn heads. Your compliments will get compliments. \nFrom that first spritz my eyes opened wider than the heavens and I was shook. I'm not one for sweet or fruity perfumes, which this is, but it's not sugary sweetness. It's more of a Smooth and creamy and rich sweetness that is balanced by the tartness from the citrus notes, Jasmin, Rose and Patchouli.  \nThis smells rich. Wear this to a business breakfast or morning date. Wear this to your MIL or FIL house. Wear this to bed at night (or probably don't, it's quite costly.) \nThe bouquet never gets cloying or muggy, even in the hot sun. This is amazing. This will turn you into a snob.", "5": "This is a really great frag.  This is a fragrance you HAVE TO WEAR CORRECTLY guys.  I have been all over the INTERNET looking for how to wear this fragrance to get the best results for both YOU and the people around you. There are  SOOO many opinions on this I actually contacted the creed boutique and even though it is an opinion, it is THEIR opinion.  Erwin Creed said TWO sprays on the wrist if YOU want to enjoy it, OR (NOT AND!) two sprays on the back of the neck for OTHERS to enjoy.  People talk about how this scent fades quickly.  Guys, let me tell you, THIS FRAG DOES NOT FADE QUICKLY. Your BRAIN just shuts off the smell for your benefit. If you keep spraying this stuff you will offend others around you and you will be \"that guy.\" DO NOT GO MORE THAN 3 sprays with this stuff!!!; and if you DO go 3 make sure the 3rd is under your clothes...as in under your shirt. This is a frag that You wear and not the other way around.  If somebody says \"hey man you smell like Aventus\" that is NOT a compliment and you have warn toooo much. The reviewers on YouTube on this fragrance really need to do more research on how to wear a frag and should quit acting like experts.  It's not just about personal opinion but for the sake of others. Less is more with this frag. I wore 3 sprays on the skin at a restaurant and it offended a couple behind me to the point that they made a comment to the waitress. Trust me....If YOU can't smell it DOES NOT MEAN others cant!!! You have been warned. NOSE FATIGUE will set in with this fragrance, so you amateurs that say \"I can't smell it after 2 hours\" trust me others can!\n\nAlso, I have smelled both batches, BOTH are Aventus.  There is really no such thing as a BETTER batch.  These are made with ingredients of natural oils, there may be some differences because no two pieces of art are alike. If you wear the 03, 02, or the 01 ITS ALL AVENTUS.  People really if you complain about the batch code on a creed fragrance you may want to go with something like an \"aqua de Geo\" or a \"cool water\" those are probably more up your ally. You will get complimented on both and both smell uniquely great!  There are also variations and other creed frags that you never hear any complaints about.  Let the creeds be for the refined and confident and not for the cry baby's who don't understand that quality comes in many different shades.

It's fine. The more ya'll hate it, the more you won't wear it, and the more unique I will smell when I do. It remains my signature scent and most complimented fragrance since 2015 when my wife first bought me the travel size for Christmas and I started my Aventus journey. There are a lot of misconceptions out there about this fragrance. Let me attempt to dispel 2 of them. \n\nMisconception number 1: Aventus is expensive. This is only true if you actually buy it in bottle form with full presentaton. There are plenty of trusted decanters out there. I get 50ML bottles for less than $100 and lasts me well over a year. \n\nMisconception number 2: Modern Aventus doesn't perform well. This is nonsense, at least for me. I have had one batch from every year since 2015 and while every one one of them has smelled slightly different, they have all lasted well over 24 hours on my skin, projecting 12 plus hours on many occassions. I'm aware that Aventus has been reformulated so I can't imagine what it used to do. (The first batch I ever smelled was definitely noticeably smokier and heavier). Must have been insane. \n\nNow I believe olfactory fatigue and a newly sprayed, immature bottle are mostly the reasons people think Aventus disappears on their skin. I do tend to lose the scent on and off, but then it comes back and hits me. Or someone will compliment me 12 hours in and I'll remember and smell it again myself. And as far as the other problem, when my Aventus gets low, I get another decant and spray that. That way, its matured and ready to go for when I run out. \n\nNo fragrance can be perfect. Not everyone will love it. It won't work for everyone's skin. But if you're looking for something that's a little special but also smells fantastic and gets you noticed, this is a safe bet to at least try and get your nose on. It's a very high quality, super versatile scent. I still haven't smelled a roasted pineapple quite like it. The perfect mix of fresh and woody. I love the opening, but I really love the dry down so much. Taking deep whiffs of my wrist when I wake up in the morning. I have several fragrances, but this is still my fave.", "8": "Once upon a time, a pineapple fell in love with some oak moss. After several weeks of casually dating, they decided to go camping. They light a campfire and made hot, stanky love in front of it. \n\nNow, this wasn't the pineapples first rodeo. He'd been been around the block a few times and knew how to please dat oak mozz. After an hour of so of intense pineapple sex, he treated the Oak Moss to a rub down of vanilla, currant, and other assorted oils. \n\nAventus is the bottled sweat of their sexy time.", "9": "One of the bravest things I have ever done in my life was to blind buy Creed Aventus. As it turned out it was also one of the most satisfying decisions I have made. The blind buy was a year ago, based entirely on what I was getting from CDNIM Limited Edition Parfum. I figured that if a clone is this magnificent surely the original must be worth the exorbitant extra spend. The hype and the legendary status that Creed Aventus had lured me into the monumental decision of spending the most amount of money I have ever spent on a fragrance. Let me tell you I soon discovered it is worth the $330. So much so that I purchased the 10th. Anniversary Edition a week later.\n\nFor a full year before I had done everything I could to convince myself it was a fragrance not worth having in my collection. I deliberately read articles/opinions and watched many YouTube videos where Aventus was bashed and torn to shreds. It was somehow satisfying my yearning to believe this fragrance simply wasn't worth it. But I would lie in bed wondering. Wondering if it might be a case of people with an agenda, or simply that they didn't like what Aventus offered.\n\nThen CDNIM Limited Edition Parfum became available here in South Africa and I thought: Okay it's $50, even if the scent is simply good I won't have sleepless nights over the spend. Suddenly some of the people who were hostile towards Aventus were heaping praise on all the iterations of Armaf's CDNIM - the EDT, EDP and Limited Edition Parfum. It was all about the price. They were gushing over how similar the Armaf dupes were to Aventus, and here I was absolutely loving CDNIM Limited Edition Parfum. \n\nIt took a matter of life and death to help me go gung-ho and buy the Creed original. Last year in July we experienced rioting and the threat of an all out civil war in South Africa as people went on the rampage looting and setting fire to businesses and threatening to kill anyone who stood in their way. It was the most afraid I have been living in a country where the crime rate is already out of control (it might still be the rape capital of the world; and we have at least 20,000 murders annually). I stood with folk from my suburb and town defending our families, homes and livelihoods from the ever-increasing number of criminal scum this Godforsaken country has produced over the past 30 years. When it was all over it was a time for us as a nation and as individuals to do a great deal of reflection and soul-searching.\n\nI remember sitting in front of this PC with the Creed Aventus listing on Rio Perfumes (a trusted and outstanding fragrance store based in Johannesburg) open in front of me. I added the fragrance to my basket, and proceeded to checkout. My finger hovered over the mouse for what seemed like ages before I clicked buy to complete the transaction. I did this for me. I did this knowing that I had faced down one of the most traumatic experiences of my life a couple of weeks earlier, and damn it I was going to live as much as I could and do a little bit more for me. It was about time, too.\n\nWhen the parcel arrived three days later (that is considered excellent service where I am from), it was like a ceremony for me to open the box, hold the sealed Creed creation in my hand, unwrap it and to finally hold that iconic fragrance in my hands. What a moment that was for me. It was already afternoon so I reserved the following day for my very first wearing of Creed Aventus. No word of lie I think on that particular night I probably got about a quarter of the amount of sleep that I usually get. I actually got up once just to look at that box again to make sure I really had the fragrance in my possession.\n\nNeedless to say I got up a little earlier than usual. Teeth brushed and flossed; I took my time with shaving my head; got into the shower. By 7AM I was all dressed up. My grey chinos; red, blue and white check shirt; a petrol blue Trenery blazer; and my tan Rockport brogues. Yes, I was not messing around - this was no ordinary day.\n\nThere it was, right there in my hands. That beautiful black cap with the silver Creed crest atop was gently lifted off. I smelled the atomiser and was already smelling the magic coming off the bottle, almost as if it had an aura of its own. One, two, three, four... Four sprays on my torso in a holy cross formation - that is how I do it. As I buttoned up my shirt and proceeded to tuck it into my chinos I felt my eyes roll back into my head. Oh My Dear Beautiful God!\n\nI am proof that there is no substitute for the real Creed Aventus. I have four different versions of CDNIM; numerous other fragrances with the Aventus DNA including Monsieur Le Prince Intense by Princesse Marina De Bourbon which is a stunningly sublime fragrance I wish was given more attention. None of them compares to the majestic quality of the original Creed. Aventus is exquisite. It is deserving of my writing the longest fragrance review I ever have. I will add that the new CDNIM Pure Parfum is far and away the closest to the original you are going to find, so well done to Armaf. I have two 150ml. bottles of it, and it is the best clone of Aventus.\n\nOn that first day of wearing Aventus I was not walking, I was floating. That is how this fragrance made me feel. It kicked off with the most delectable pineapple and bergamot opening, and dried down to that sumptuous birch, vanilla and musk. I was still getting fleeting wafts of pineapple, the rest of the top notes and patchouli in the dry-down. My word, that dry-down of Aventus is spectacular. I got at least 13 hours of longevity on that first day, and it has only gotten better since. Both my Aventus and the 10th. Anniversary Edition are from 2020, and they are giving me the same longevity. And yes there are subtle differences between the two, but both equally beautiful.\n\nThis extraordinary fragrance made me see what magic a scent can do for your well-being and confidence. It can truly inspire you, make you eager to take on the world. That first day with Aventus was the stuff of dreams for me. As I lay my head on my pillow after showering that evening, I had a colossal smile on my face. It was a good day. I closed my eyes and decided this is a fragrance I will reserve for special moments, for those momentous days. I also wondered if it was a good idea washing off the scent with that shower (I shower twice a day; it's a habit that is as engrained in me as breathing is). But as I lifted my duvet over my chest an intoxicating, heavenly zephyr blew over my face. It was... The return of the King\ud83d\udc51", "10": "I have worn Aventus intermitantly since 2012 and I am now going to share some of my personal experiences of it over the years which will trigger many people who seem to forget that perfumery is art and not some cost/benefit ratio analysis as dictated by one bitter person. \n\nAventus reshaped the fragrance world way ahead of its time. It was actually created by the visionary Pierre Bourdain even though the great marketeer/conman Olivier Creed stole all the credit and made up some laughable history about Napoleon and various other regal connections.  \n\nAventus is a simple fragrance executed beyond compare - the notes which tug on your heart strings are the pineapple, birch, rose and ambergris. Everything else lingers in a supporting role to round out the impact, with the apple lending juice to the sauna dry birch and the jasmine a nice floral freshness. \n\nThe batch variation dramas are really just reflective of how fragile and needy our psychologies are when it comes to love and infatuation because I assure you that the end product of Aventus is as consistent as any other fragrance on the market. Yes, really. What does make it different is maceration time and the version of the Creed atomiser you had (depending on year). Creed pride themselves on the 'millesime' maturation of its fragrances due to the high naturals content, a process they compare to wine maturation. I cannot know if this is just cutting QC corners, but I do know that every Aventus bottle I have had required at least 6 months of development before I got the best of it. At this point the fragrance blossoms and I get the Aventus I know and love - conjurings of smokey pineapple, as suitable watching the tennis as it is in the boardroom, then the bar having been blown in the toilets after martini 236. I get 8-10 hours of solid wear, with the pineapple tag teaming with the birch until it all settles to smoke, ambergris and vanilla. A cushioned haze, a familiar vibe - always wayfarers and RL crisp white shirts apres yachting in my mind. \n\nThe old fire hydrant atomiser delivered awesome plumes of fragrance that worked so well with Aventus, even if they were prone to breaking! I have noticed the new nozzles provide more of a 'stream' of fragrance which messes with the balance of the fragrance per pump.\n\nAre Creed full of BS? Oh yes, they are insane - this is fact, do some research and you will be scandalised. Is it very expensive? Certainly. Is Aventus worth it? Here's the thing, is any form of art 'worth it'? The answer is yes if you love it and can afford to welcome it into your life. It's that simple and of course, that hard as money is rather important in this world. We seem to be turning perfumery into macro economic analyses of wealth and financial responsibility - it's hate filled and totally irrelevant to the culture, please save this for your anti Blackrock marches. \n\nMany fragrances smell like Aventus because it does not own the right to fragrance notes but it's lazy to outright find another pineapple dominant fragrance and declare that it's the same as Aventus, but cheaper. Just don't fool yourself - the clones are soulless, fixative heavy and corny. If you are happy wearing fakes good for you, but at least be honest with yourself. Plus, have you seen those hideous CDN bottles with the diamant\u00e9 studs and shiny tags, wow? I would rather just go for a different fragrance recipe altogether. \n\nI look forward to my next adventures with Aventus and in truth, I selfishly hope it receives way more hate and becomes shunned until it is a true niche once more. But I know that's selfish and a betrayal of artistic appreciation; the perfume community deserves so much more than that. Approach Aventus with an open mind and even if you do not like it, it will be a valuable history lesson in the inspiration behind most of the fragrances out there: Bourdain's brilliant mind.", "11": "Let me give you gentlemen a heads-up. This fragrance has massive batch variations. This is more problematic than with any Creed fragrance I've smelled! If you buy from the wrong batch you risk getting a cologne that lacks longevity, smells like dry tobacco with zero fruit or have an overly synthetic vibe to it. \n\nCreed should begin notifying their customers about what batch they are buying, because making people blind-buy horrible batches is almost criminal. I love this fragrance as I've stated before, but paying three-digit numbers for a bottle that is worse than the bottle the year before is inexusable.\n\nGet your act together, Creed.", "12": "For generations Mankind has been searching for the perfect fragrance. A fragrance that lasts all day without fading. A fragrance that suits nearly any occasion whether professional, casual, romantic, or adventurous. A fragrance that bathes the wearer in an aura of sublime elegance without being overpowering. A fragrance that was milked from the very essence of refined masculinity. Ladies and gentlemen, in my travels to the distant and dangerous land of Neiman Marcus, I have found such a fragrance. To the indigenous people it is known as a king. To some, even, a God. If you listen closely to the wind whispering across the lonely sea, you can hear its name: Aventus.\n\nA powerfully understated infusion of fruits, woods, leather, patchouli, and musk of impeccable quality. The fragrance equivalent of fine silk. No, not the most complex or the most daring fragrance on the market, but it doesn't have to be those things to be truly great. Aventus is like a crisp white shirt, or a 1964 Aston Martin DB5: simple, yet universally appealing, and eternally fashionable.", "13": "After I bought Aventus,I sold all my 'day' fragrances. Aventus makes other frangrances look like squid. In Korea, lots of people use ferrari, john varvatos, bvlgari and polo.  guess what..  Lots of people make complements and ask me what I'm wearing. Ladies love it too!", "14": "I think people have a right to know that Aventus has degenerated as much as it has BEFORE they pull the trigger and buy it. There is no doubt that it has been reformulated because Oakmoss has been banned from perfumery. I'm happy I have a 2010 because I have tested the authentic Aventus that is currently available for purchase and it is a shell of what it used to be. Honestly you are far better off buying Dior Sauvage or Chanel Bleu over the current formulation of Aventus. This review is to help people from waisting there money. Another thing I've noticed is that retailers are using an older pre-reformulated bottle of Aventus as a tester and suckering people into buying it thinking that they are purchasing the exact same juice. I would give anything to have the original formula Aventus back. It was everything that people hyped it up to be lady killer, panty dropper all that. It was the ultimate men's fragrance without a doubt. However I absolutely cannot say that about the current version. \n\nThe scent to me conjured up visions of being in a luxury sports car and taking in all the smells of the car like the Nappa leather interior, woodgrain dashboard, and even the gasoline and petrol fumes much like Dior Fahrenheit did years before, but where Fahrenheit was strictly leather and gasoline, Aventus went more the crowd pleaser route and added an interesting mix of pineapple, apple, and black currant which made it into more of a Fruity Chypre type, but by no means synthetic or shower gel-like, like Bleu de Chanel which had also just come out right around the same time as Aventus.\n\nFurthermore it was a perfect fragrance as the rose was not too strong, nor dirty in the birch-rose combo but soft and a little powdery. The smoky birch notes remained until the dry-down and it was joined on stage by an oak moss accord giving more earthiness to the composition. I particularly enjoyed the vanilla accord that emerged towards the dry-down. The creamy sweetness of the vanilla gave a nice balance to the oak moss and birch.That drydown lasted throughout the day with perfect sillage, evolved a lot and ended up after about 10-12 hrs with a very nice and powdery leather-fruity-musk smell.", "15": "Creed really nailed this one right. With Napoleon as inspiration, Aventus speaks of Triumph and tragedy, war and peace, love and lust. It evokes memories both good and bad. A true masterpiece and bar none the best male fragrance to come out in the past 30 or so years.\nTwo very enthusiastic thumbs up!", "16": "Well, today I said goodbye to an old friend that was one of my first blind buys ever before I got started with this hobby. This was the one that got me excited and extremely addicted to the world of fragrance. \n\nAs I finished off the bottle and the sprayer ran dry this morning, many things were running through my mind. I still remember visiting the aventus profile on here almost daily, intrigued by the notes and the high praises from all of you reviewers. The high price tag was what made me drag my feet so long but I finally pulled the trigger on a 1oz bottle at a discounted price. \n\nI will never forget the first time I smelled this. It was and probably will remain one of the best fragrances I've ever smelled, hands down. I can't remember if it was 2013 or 2014 when I bought it, but it seems to be the consensus here that this was when aventus was the \"holy grail\" scent everyone spoke so highly of. I can't speak for today's batches as I have not smelled any of them. I've never been good at detecting individual notes but the best way I can describe mine was fruity, smoky and dry (I'm assuming that's the birch). \n\nNow, to the performance. This stuff was STRONG. I never put more than one spray on and it's a good thing I didn't because even though I got insane compliments, I heard just as many people say how strong it was. I don't like that. I like my scent to be subtle, not overbearing. If any spray touched my clothing I could still easily smell it even days after. On skin, I'd consistently get longevity of 12+ hours with heavy projection for the first 5-6 hours and slowly fading to a skin scent after that. \n\nI probably won't buy this again. Even though I absolutely loved it, I had trouble wearing it in public without feeling self conscious about how strong it was. Not to mention it's crazy expensive. I will never forget you aventus, or the memories we have together, good and bad. \n\n10/10 and two thumbs way up", "17": "I will start out by saying I dislike most Creed fragrances. Some of them are downright repulsive to me.  I tend to dislike niche fragrances in general.  Out of the Creeds I have smelled, I only like Aventus and SMW.  But Aventus, it is just fabulous.  I absolutely love it.  It deserves it's legendary status.  So, from someone who is by no means a Creed fanboy or a niche fanboy, Aventus is the real deal!", "18": "All of the negative comments on Aventus are complete bullshit.  There is no problem with the longevity. This stuff has always been good for 8+ hours. There is also no problem with its stability. Creed continues to smell good for more than a decade like every other quality fragrance.  There are no \u201cbatch variations.\u201d I have three bottles, and they all started out highly fruity and got woodier as they aged. Anything popular from the Creed Boutique is fruitier because it is younger and fewer top notes have evaporated through the nozzle (this happens, it isn\u2019t air-tight).  If you put down Aventus because \u201ceveryone has it,\u201d you need to do a reality check. I challenge to you quiz 100 random 25-45-year-old men about what they wear, and I wager that not one of them will say Aventus.", "19": "It's called the King for a reason. Fruity, woody leathery freshness in a bottle that just reeks of class and masculinity. Co-workers of mine have told me that I smell \"Heavenly\" no joke. \n\n10/10", "20": "I've tried so many, and nothing comes even close to Aventus. It's unique, and VERY well blended. The birch/wood note makes it so masculine. My \"go to\" and #1 fragrance.", "21": "Smoky pineapple, one of the best of all time no doubt. \n\nNot all batches are the same though. Sometimes it's heavenly, sometimes it's really not that great.\n\nIt's a classic but the price and batch variance put me off. If I pay top dollar I want bang on quality everytime. \n\nAlso it quite true what some say, this is a male compliment getter. More men have approached me with this than women.", "22": "Ginny 17: you have made your point (about 14 times). \nYou think the fragrance is worth the price, because it smells good on your husband. \nApart from that you do not add a lot in terms of scent experience. \nYou seem to keep defending Creed and Aventus; there is no need for that. Lovers are lovers and there will always be haters. \nYou love it, but have some restraint, after all, this a review page, or else, try to be original and have a sense of humour.", "23": "I hope that cancel culture will one day come to the perfume industry. That consumers will boycott new formulations that do not last even 3 hours. Naive beginners and snobs are buying, buying more than ever, and of course greedy companies are rubbing their hands, diluting and weakening fragrances even more in order to make more profit, and consumers are still buying and that is a vicious circle.\n\nBe careful when reading reviews because anyone can write them. Maybe a beginner or a seller from ebay is hiding behind the review, so be careful! Maybe someone is writing out of economic interest. Someone bought new Aventus, got disappointed with poor performance, then uploads it to ebay and comes here to praise the batch he is selling just to sell it easier. Creed's greed or new fragrance industry regulations destroyed this masterpiece. I wouldn't give 50 euros for the new Aventus. It doesn't last, it doesn't project, it is watered down compared to pre 2020 batches.\n\nAfter owning 2021 batches: H11, P01, P11, S01, S11, T11 I have to give up from Aventus. It has citrusy opening that lasts for 10 minutes. In the drydown appears to be watered down compared to my previous batches and there is little or no smoke at all. I am buying Aventus to get that smoky fresh type of scent. This isn't the case here. I can detect more vanilla than smoke, shame. It has good projection for the first 20-30 minutes, then becomes skin scent. After 3-4 hours it is gone. It's a shame what I have paid 300 euros. I have to applicate more than 25 sprays to get moderate performance for few hours. And still I don't get compliments because nobody can smell it on me after one or two hours. Spraying clothes doesn't work either becaue it is weak fragrance! At the price tag of 300 euros for 100ml it's not worth it. Before 2021 I had bottle from 2019 which smelled very nice and performance was very very good. It had nice projection and longevity.\nCreed Greed Aventus is the best joke of 2021. I am laughing so hard what I fool I am, to pay 300 euros for the scent that doesn't project more than 30 minutes.\n\nI am also using Armaf since 02/2017 and had every single batch till the end of 2020. Now I am using 07/2021 and it is a monster!!! Aventus has that 'natural' pineapple opening, where CDNI is a synthetic lemon. CDNI opening is not harsh anymore. Opening last for 10-20 minutes. In the drydown they are the same smell except CDNI has much much better performance to offer than Aventus 2021 batches. With few sprays of Armaf you are good to go for the whole day and you will always get compliments because it has sillage, where Aventus is skin scent nowadays and no one will be able to smell it on you from the distance. For 300 euros (cost of Aventus) I can buy 10 bottles of Armaf and get beast type of fragrance for next few years.\n\nSorry Creed Greed, but you beheaded your own emperor, Aventus is not the king anymore.", "24": "Fragrance -Aventus Creed\nBottle from - 2016\n\nWe all have turning points in our lives.A moment in time,no matter how painful and difficult it may be,when we begin to see things more clearly,begin to be honest with ourselves, recognize that we made some mistakes in our past and we are not afraid anymore to do the right thing,turn the page and finally move forward in our lifes.At that point in time,  Aventus is the perfect choice.\n\nLongevity - 9/10(9+hours)\nSilage/projection -8/10(nice projection for the first 2-3 hours,silage also exist)\nWeather - all time,best in spring and summer(Versatility-10/10)   \nAge - 20+ \nCompliments - 9/10\nScent - 10/10 (amazing fragrance) \n\nMain notes according to me -pineapple,birch,musk,bergamot,apple,black currant.\n\nThe drydown is amazing and i get some -woodiness,vanille,musk and ambergris.\n\nEmotions -exceptional,elegant,extraordinary,remarkable,sexy,life defining moments.\n\nOccasion -perfect for more or less any ocasion and any time of year.\n\nCould be a great signature scent.You'll get compliments with this one.", "25": "I have five different bottles of Aventus, that I purchased in the last five years: 16H01,16K11,18B01, 20M01 and 21N01. I read many reviews here that claim that this perfume has no power at all. Others say it is very expensive for what it offers, or that the clones are much more attractive. I do not dispute these statements, not at all, I'm just saying what this juice does FOR ME. \nAll five bottles I have smell slightly different, that's right, but in the end each one is simply magical in its own way. The old ones have a more elegant side and the newer ones are fruity and fresh as the old ones were at the beginning. But none of them perform under 12 hours FOR ME\nHere where I live, in Romania, I always managed to buy Aventus for around \u20ac200, years ago even cheaper, so FOR ME the quality/price ratio is satisfactory.\nI have never smelled an Aventus clone, so FOR ME they don't exist. Those who love them, may enjoy them forever. \nA little advice if I may:  those who write reviews here should particularize not generalize. No one has the absolute truth, everyone knows their own experience with Aventus. \nFOR ME, Aventus is the best I have found so far in the vast number of perfumes on the market. I'm still looking for something to surpass it. Maybe I'll find it, maybe not, but I'm happy with what I have.", "26": "One of the reasons why you see a lot of people here having different opinions about the uniqueness of Aventus is the ridiculous price difference between the EU/UK and USA/Canada.\n\nNorth America taxes beauty and cosmetic products significantly heavier than Europe. So a 100 ml bottle of Aventus will cost you around 500 USD or \u20ac480. \n\nWhereas if you literally travel to France, go to Creed's flagship boutique in Paris, and ask for a 100 ml Aventus, it will cost you \u20ac150 or 180 USD.\n\nIt's reasonable to assume that Aventus has still maintained it's \"unique\" status in North America. Mainly because it's significantly more expensive than it is in Europe, and also because most people aren't that into fragrances to know about clones and imitations. \n\nThe only designer brand that somewhat copied Aventus was Montblanc. Not even the fragrance sales advisors here in Canada know what Armaf is, let alone the customers.\n\nHowever for Europe, where Aventus is certainly more attainable for the average person compared to NA, and with the overall more popularity of fragrance use, it's obvious that Aventus and it's army of clones will be detected and noticed more often.\n\nWord of advice to anyone in USA or Canada who wants to buy their first bottle of Aventus, the \"Aventus is played out/ too popular\" comments here don't apply to you. I guarantee that if you go out and ask 1000 men what cologne they were, you can probably count on your hands the number of them that will say Creed Aventus.", "27": "Well it can be described by one word - elixir - it is healing, sexy, mysterious, sexy, calming, did I mentioned sexy? :-)\n\nBest fragrance I've owned so far and my #1 of all time!

I was amazed at the whiffs that regularly got from this while having dinner and many times before going to bed. To my utter surprise, even when I got up in the morning, I could still smell it on my wrist and this never happened before with me and the best point was that it was growing on me hour by hour. I started loving it more and more as I smelled it either with a whiff that I got while moving my hand or intentionally smelling my wrist. I am a big fan of musk at the dry down and this was the perfect one for me. \nThe next day I went back to the shop and almost shocked when I heard the price:-)) I was not sure would it be worth spending that kind of money on a perfume.

The only problem about this fragrance is the price. It is overpriced and over hyped in my opinion if you consider the ingredients used. Will I buy another bottle? This fragrance could be my signature scent if one day I am wealthy enough. Otherwise no!", "32": "I adore this sexy beast of a fragrance on my husband.

Another huge plus is that it has great performance and longevity for me. \n\nThis is without a doubt my most complimented fragrance. I am constantly asked what it is I'm wearing or \"can you write down for me the name of that cologne?\" I'm always being told how amazing it smells. \n\nHere's the thing about it though and others have mentioned it as well. Olfactory fatigue is very real with Aventus. You may think the scent has gone faint, but it hasn't. I have gotten compliments 6+ hours after applying it. \n\nIs it pricey? Sure. Is it worth it? To me it absolutely is.", "34": "So, I finally got to sample this a few days ago and I can honestly say, \"I DO NOT GET THE HYPE!\" It smells fine (decent fragrance), but if you're spending $300 on a bottle of fragrance based upon hype alone, then surely, it's going to smell like the best thing in the world.", "35": "Based on Napoleon's life?

The day I try AVENTUS on my skin for the first time. Usually I try to avoid reading any comments or reviews on a fragrance I have yet to try or will be reviewing if I have not read anything already (researching), to try and keep an open mind. After Marlen (perfumecritic) reviewed it formally on here, I decided I would most likely enjoy this particular offering from CREED. Only today did I realise the \"community\" was so polarised over this one, claiming everything from \"been there done that\" to grumblings of variations in batches, to love at first sniff...well, Lana Lool sent me a large full carded sample from the CREED counter, so here goes\n\n*sprays from sample with own sprayer* (all the CREED samples I have are the \"dab on\" type, but having been told about the \"blowing\" thing and how it evolves or not by how it goes on the skin...so I erred on the side of caution here:\n\nWow...not bad. I am definitely getting fruit here, albeit a light blend of sheer fruits. Black currants (almost \"plummy\") along with crisp apple and bergamot swirl around with playful and (getting much sweeter now) creamy pineapple. I think, in this case anyway, I buy the \"hype\"; as I dabbed some juice from the lid/stopper under my wrist and then sprayed (in a long fine mist) the top of the same arm...underneath the wrist: some earthy and slightly floral air with a caloney feel BUT on top of the arm: an amazingly different array of notes and scents...much more airy and fresh and less sweet and thick. By Jove, it's true! The birch note here is more like white birch bark and not \"tarry\" or overly smoky at all. Rose and jasmine play quietly on a soft bed of fresh patchouli leaves. An interesting juxtapostion between male and female (woody and floral) notes. There is something here, as it goes on, that is giving me some kind of Deja Vu...but I will be damned if I can say \"of what\"?! This is, perhaps, the lightest \"dark\" fragrance I have ever sniffed. (Noir Lite? LOL) The finish (though this does have the usual CREED lifespan, ie: DAYS on paper, all day on skin) is soft and clean, but warm and sexy at the same time. Aventus intrigues me...but does NOT really \"WOW!\" me. (What IS that aroma that it reminds so much of??). Worth a decant or split? Sure...A full bottle at CREED prices? I am leaning towards a \"no\" here, though, if this is your thing, it would be soooo worth it to invest. Since it IS a quality scent for sure, just nothing all that earth-shattering. I shall (upon further wearings and finishing this generous sample) report back if my feelings have changed. Right now, as it stands, lovin it...but not in love with it!!\n\nSillage: above average\nLongevity: excellent (as usual)\nOverall: 4/5\n\nNow then...I agree that this is (probably) the most mass market smelling or \"popular\" (I REFUSE to call it generic, as it is anything but) CREED scent I have smelled, but it is still very good. Quality? Obvious (duh?!) Class? For sure, Worth it?...*hesitates* get back to me on that, will ya?", "38": "This review is long overdue and my reasons were mostly related to the massive discussion related to batches. In order to help anyone here make a good decision. I will tell you how my Aventus research journey went and advise you on how to proceed. So,  please bear with me. \n\nI tried Aventus at a Creed boutique and I kept sniffing the test strip all day and decided that I should get a bottle. It smelled amazing and it transformed beautifully throughout the day. \n\nBUT, and this is a big BUT.. My bottle just didn't perform and smelled a bit different than the tester. It was heavier on the bergamot and less smokey in the dry down. Batch 19Y01N. So I researched and as it turns out, the reformulation was not the only problem. Due to regulations, bergamot, oakmoss and birch had to be synthetic oils (I think post 2013). Due to that change, the fragrance lost a lot of power and some of its character. \n\nThat being said, many people on Aventus facebook groups swear that their bottles perfomed amazingly but only after a year or so of being on their shelf. The fragrance matured and the synthetic notes brokedown and it became stronger. Older bottles were ready to use out of the box. The older the bottle gets the better, basically. But that's terrible considering the hefty price you pay for the 'natural oils' and great performance of this chypre fragrance. \n\nSo don't aim for a batch really, if you wana get it just spray a few on you and leave it to mature. Trust me don't test it every other week. Just leave it. Also, buy it discounted. \n\nThe excessive amount of clones is overwhelming as well and kind of kills the fragrance. No they don't smell as good. But close enough to mislead some noses. It's sad really.. \n\nThere is no excuse for this to be happening (especially when you factor in the price) but what to do. I do love the fragrance and I hope this helps!", "39": "In short I believe this is the most over rated fragrance in existence. I also believe Creed in general is over rated. They must have an allstar marketing department", "40": "\"Masculine & Sexy\"\n\nI won't get into the scent or the notes because everything that had to be said about Aventus has been said. However, I will explain what I love and don't love about Aventus:\n\nLove:\n\n1. I love the fact that Aventus is super sexy but extremely masculine at the same time. You can be rugged and alpha male but also smell extremely sexy.\n\n2. Aventus is the fragrance I wear when I meet with someone for the first time, or when people don't know me well. It a safe choice, leaves an excellent impression, but it is inoffensive as well. If Aventus offends someone, there is seriously something wrong with the person that is being offended. \n\n3. Aventus is a compliment receiver, and it memorizes people. I see it in their eyes!\n\nDon't Love:\n\n1. As an engineer, quality control is extremely important in my job. Creed has failed Aventus in this department because different batches smell differently, and the bottles can be defective. In fact, some bottles are 100% full while some of them are 98-99% full. \n\n2. I paid $250 for Aventus. I also paid $250 for Ambra Aurea from Profumum Roma, $200 for Opus VI from Amouage, and $245 for Xerjoff 1861 Zefiro. I consistently get +12 hour longevity on Ambra Auera, Opus VI, 1861, but 3-4 hour longevity on Aventus. \n\nThere should not be an excuse for these defects at this price and quality.\n\n3. Aventus is becoming the Acqua Di Gio of niche fragrances. It is everywhere, so it is not very exclusive. \n\n\nFinal Rating:\n\nIf you love fragrances, you must have an Aventus. However,at this price, Aventus must do better. As much as I love the scent, Aventus is inferior to many products in its price range in terms of longevity and performance.\n\n7/10 in its class. 9/10 overall.", "41": "Browne54 summed this up for me best when he said: \"Before smelling Aventus I would have thought I was outside of my mind to purchase a $300 fragrance.\".\n\nI own and have smelled 100's of fragrances - niche, indy and designer. But this is the only one with this kind of price tag that had me immediately reaching for my wallet. There's something intoxicating about that combination of smoky pineapple, birch and leather that ticks all the right boxes. Doesn't hurt that it lasts all day, projects with just the right amount of authority and is perfectly versatile, too. Like I said, this one ticks all the right boxes. The only snag is the price...\n\nTo me, this fragrance is not a question of \"if\" you should buy it, it's more a matter of if you can justify spending this kind of money on a fragrance. In my mind, that's an easy question to answer. Besides, you can find 120ml bottles now for $190, which isn't even all that bad when you're talking about something this good. It's strong, too. A couple sprays with it's \"fire hose\" atomizer is all you need, so a bottle will last a long time.\n\nThere are 3 things I know about Aventus:\n\n#1: I love it.\n#2: Women seem to love it as I've gotten some of the most enthusiastic responses ever wearing this fragrance\n#3: It is Nieman Marcus' top selling Creed fragrance (at least in Scottsdale) and won their fragrance of the year award, so obviously a lot of people think this is worth the coin even at full retail (which is $330 I believe) \n\nThe bottom line is, does Aventus live up to the hype? Hell yes it does! Moreso than many other overhyped fragrances. \n\nMY RATING:\n\nScent 4/4\nLongevity 2/2\nProjection 2/2\nVersatility 2/2\n\n9/10 (-1 for price). Aventus would be a full 10/10 if it was more affordable. But if the price point keeps this from becoming too popular, I'm all for it... can't have everyone smelling this good.", "42": "I live in a coastal town and I have smelled Aventis twice on other people in the last year which is a lot for my location. I feel with all the clones and over hype it has lost it's uniqueness and exclusivity. I don't feel I will purchasing another bottle as I don't spend $450 on a fragrance that smells to the masses like it is a common designer perfume. I did that with Green Irish Tweed everybody thought I was wearing cold water\nWhich leaves you feeling quiet self conscious especially if it is a special occasion or your presenting your best self.", "43": "i dropped and smash my decant at work. Very dark moment in ones life.\nBut hey, best smelling pawn shop on earth!", "44": "The 'hype' comes from people who genuinely love this fragrance and want to share it. It just happens to be liked by a lot of people.\n\nIf you like it, great!\nIf you don't, great!\nKeep calm and move on.", "45": "you don't need to pay the retail price it's just mental thing that you will get the reall deal or the original stuff !!! ,Fragrancenet.com ,Perfume4us.com and alote of sellers on Ebay they having a great deals on it , the only reason why they sell it for cheaper price than the retailer price is that they get it from the middle east specially from the Gulf countries where you can find it way cheaper than anywhere else , I'm studying Canada and I'm Originality From Kuwait , when i went back home in the summer time i got my Aventus(A42b12c02)from one of the stores there for 50 Kuwaiti dinars witch is almost 150$ , because what the stores do they buy there stuff from the supplier by the value price while the big stores there they get it from the supplier for cheap and sell it almost 85 Kuwaiti dinars ( 250$ ), when i got back to Canada i purchased another Aventus from creed boutique for 380 $ after the taxes and shipping wondering does smell different or not , they all Exactly the same !! .\n\nso this what some sellers with great deals do, they get it all the way from there (middle east) for value price and sell them for good price comparing with the retailer's , some people asking why the hell we have creed products with some Arabian descriptions card inside the box , Creed have different production lines , the Arabian one they put the Arabian description cards in the boxes and the international one they put the multiple languages description cards .\n\nhope you guys have a great sharp deals on this monster so we all smell good without ripping our pockets lol .\n\nWarm wishes", "46": "I adore the pineapple note. Delicious. I think this could be unisex.", "47": "I finally got my nose on this \"legend\" among Creed fanatics and fragrance aficionados alike but truly, disappointment doesn't begin to tell the story, especially after the mass amount of hype surrounding the \"holy grail\" of a fragrance that is Aventus, accompanied by its hefty price tag. I'm not sure which \"batch\" I received in my 5 ml decant but in a nutshell, Aventus is a faint pineapple dominated by an extremely heavy smokiness. A natural birch and fresh cut florals annex a green and slightly herbacious element to the smoldering ash that eventually engulfs any fruity note to this fragrance. More so, I'd probably categorize it as a smokey incense smell that lasts well above 8 hours and projects fairly heavily. \nI would probably purchase a bottle eventually, but it's definitely not at the top of my niche list. \nAt the risk of possibly receiving death threats, Fresco by Illum Dean bares a minor resemblance and makes up about 40% of what Aventus is, especially in the top notes. I love Fresco and always receive great feedback while wearing it. Unfortunately, when I wore Aventus on several occasions and even had my girlfriend smell it, no one complimented me and instead gave me odd looks as if I was offending them. In fact, my girlfriend thought it was so overrated and awful. She much rather prefers Green Irish Tweed and Bois De Portugal. I absolutely agree. I'm not sure if the cut I received was technically one of Creeds worst batches, but Aventus certainly feels over-hyped and underwhelming.", "48": "The smoky pineapple from C42B11Y02 batch\n\nWhen lots of eyes are turning toward you without standing out from the crowd or when women have smiling faces out of nowhere, I stopped for a second and I asked myself: \u201cGod ! What is going on ?\u201d. The answer came when I realized that I applied Aventus on my skin.\n\nAfter all this a normal question took birth in my mind: \u201cWhat makes this perfume so adored ?\u201d Compared to many perfumes, Aventus becomes a partner that you can rely on due to its pleasant smell combined with good performances. And there is something more: most people don\u2019t have a real passion for perfumes; they choose decipherable perfumes. Almost everybody can enjoy Aventus\u2019 olfactory hallmark.\n\nOnce launched from the atomizer, Aventus intrigues the olfactory senses with a mix of well-crafted citruses that are invigorating and a little bit sharp. The initial blast is losing force when the pineapple appears. Until the end of the debut (2-3 minutes) I encountered a small transition phase of which the pineapple smells like it was took out from the refrigerator and cut by a sharp cold blade. The smell was very refreshing on the first five minutes. I must say that the contrast between cold and warm gives a pleasant feel. After that the smell of the pineapple became sweeter, juicier and pulpy. This is the sign that the citruses are somewhere in the background. Now, the masculinity is rising. The whole blend is enwrapping in a smoky cloak. Superb !!! The smoky note didn\u2019t become heavy like the one met in Bois D\u2019Ascese. After hours from the first spray the blend is resting on a delicate musk note combined with a green-grey oak moss which smells like a forest floor.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a well-constructed and easy to wear blend for men. According to the code mentioned at the beginning (C42B11Y02), the word balance is suited to characterize this version.\n\nFor those who want to evade out of the comfort zone given by the aquatics and citruses, Aventus opens the way to new lands of perfumery. The pineapple, the oak moss and the birch note are well done here. To understand the way I think, let me say this: the pineapple appeals you to the land of fruity perfumes or his sweetness leads the way to the gourmand type. On the other hand, the oak moss together with the birch note are guiding your steps toward the mysterious woody fragrances. To sum up, every man who wants to enter into the niche world of perfumery must take Aventus into consideration. It represents a bridge to olfactory development. As time goes by you\u2019ll become to appreciate this perfume because it helps you understand complex or artistic fragrances.\n\nA masterpiece !\n\nNote: 10/10", "49": "Smells different every time I smell a different batch. What a joke."}, "13": {"0": "How good is this fragrance? Well, let me tell you: \nAbout a year ago I began getting into purchasing fragrances. I started with less expensive perfumes from Victoria's Secret, Bath and Body Works as well as popular celebrity frangrances.  \nRecently, I've been sniffing around the higher end fragrances (Jadore, Miss Dior, Burberry Brit, Light Blue, Bright Crystal, Hypnotic Poison, etc.). I even built a huge \"I want it\" list based on reviews from this site alone. But about a week ago I found a sample size of Alien in my possession given to me years ago by a sales associate at Macy's. I didn't like it at the time but decided to give it a try.  \nOh my goodness... \nWhat have I been doing and where have you been? You know how people say that you'll know \"the one\" when you meet them? That's how I felt about Alien. It's as if I was going through the motions with the other fragrances when all of a sudden I meet the perfume of my dreams. I can't imagine wearing anything else. I'm so in love with this fragrance that I don't plan on continuing to build a fragrance collection. I've even decreased my \"I want it\" list from over 100 to a small handful (all of which I can still live without). \nFragrance truly is a matter of personal taste. I don't care whether it's going to draw compliments, or attract men, or make me look like I'm banking a million bucks, I just like it for my own pleasure, and this is the first time that I've had this mindset about a fragrance since high school. I was swept up by all the raves on this site about this fragrance and that fragrance that I never really thought about whether it was right for ME. \nAnyway...love!", "1": "Accidental Alien encounter: sitting in the doctor's office, up on the table, half-naked, I come across this peculiar perfume sample attachment in a magazine. I'm trying to figure it out when *poof!* it suddenly sprays me in the face. Awkward. Not sure what my Doc thought when she entered the room to find a heavily perfumed patient awaiting her. Like many people, I will now forever associate Alien encounters with strange and intimate medical procedures. Thank you, Thierry Mugler. \nThe rest of the day I walked around, thinking I was smelling the bizarre perfume on the person in front of me; I had to stop short from accosting them and inquiring a few times. But no, it was right under my own nose. Literally. \nHow can I analyze it? The apparent simplicity of the notes does nothing to indicate its potency. Can mere \"Jasmine, Amber, and Woods\" create this mind numbingly otherwordly smell? Seems like there's some alchemy at work here. Alien is very secretive, morphing depending on the heat of your skin, the wind chill, possibly the position of the sun, moon, and stars.  \nThis is a fragrance of blue-green woods on an alien planet with a purple sky, mysterious resin dripping from the trees and bubbling up from gemstone-encrusted craters. I'm not even sure if it's to like or not to like. It is truly strange, synthetic, chemical, and definitely not for everyone.", "2": "As this has been my signature scent for years, I think it's finally time to give it credit where it's due. Because this fragrance is so personal to me it's harder to express all of my feelings towards it but I will try and edit as I go. First of all, Thierry Mugler is MY house (no I don't own it nor work for them lol)... as in if I were stuck on a deserted island with three things, Alien would be one of them (the Gold Excess Giant Bottle 40.1oz bottle of course)!  \nTo me it is so many things: it is beauty and refreshing sophistication, confidence yet vulnerability, alluring and sensual yet innocent, floral, sweet, spicy, and it invokes an actual feeling of purple somehow. To simply say it is foreign, as in Alien, would be too obvious but not wrong. It is my go-to fragrance, especially if I'm feeling down or am ever in need of a quick ego boost. If I close my eyes it transports me back in time to my childhood house, which had several jasmine bushes and vines climbing every pillar. It is also what I've worn in times of happiness, any cause for celebration, first dates, even job interviews; basically every important pillar in the last 5 years of my life. The feelings and memories combined in this fragrance make me feel like... like an invincible jasmine petal!  \nFrom beginning to end it is a blossoming cold jasmine flower, accompanied with a side of warm, oozing, radiant amber and served on a smooth, creamy wooden plate. The lasting power and sillage is amazing! 10/10 on skin and a 12/10 on clothing where it will last for weeks, if not months! There is no need for more than 1-2 sprays so it can last you a very long time (unless you're like me and spray it constantly on yourself just because you can lol). I also very much enjoy the fact that there are refillable bottles and therefore it is economical and eco-friendly. This is my MOST complimented perfume to date with both men and women of all ages, but in my case, especially the men!  \n***Dear Thierry Mugler, please never discontinue this as I don't have $2500 for that 40.1 oz bottle and I'm fresh out of genie lamps***", "3": "Alien is most certainly not for those looking for something formal, sweet, delicate or understated.. no, no, you don\u2019t get that here. You wan\u2019t that?, go see Lancome, or Dolce - they got your back with their lush florals and gourmands. But if you want something that makes people turn heads and look satisfyingly confused... get Alien. Shes not a run of the mill kind of gal.. She needs a wearer whose not afraid of the unsual, and downright weird. Because her jasmine comes at you, BOOM right in the first notes.. then takes you through the cashmere wood and quickly hits you with the amber righhhttt at the end... look out. It all happens so soon and it\u2019s confusing but so very enticing. Her amber comes to dominate. Alien... foreign, odd, different and you can\u2019t quite figure it out. Perhaps we never will, but perhaps we arn\u2019t meant too...try if you dare...", "4": "I was at TJMaxx to pick up a bottle of Paloma Picasso that I had had my eye on, and I bought this on impulse. The name, the color, the bizarre bottle, the supposed notes of jasmine and wood, it all sounded like a safe blind buy. (This was not a safe blind buy.)  \nI've been wanting an enduring, penetrating, provocative perfume, something where a dab will do, something to spray on at bedtime and wake up in a scent cloud, something to create an olfactory bubble of protection around myself. \nThis does that.  \nI eagerly opened the box as soon as I got in the car, and this deliciously dry, slightly peppery, woody scent wafted out. \nI held the \"talismanic\" violet bottle in my hand and spritzed a little into the perfume box. An intriguing cedar and sandalwood with some vague white floral in the background. It filled the car with a compelling scent, full of tension between masculine and feminine. \nHoping that it smelled the same on skin, I spritzed my wrist. \nGrape candy, an alien's synthetic reconstruction of jasmine, and underneath, those woods that I loved. \nI was disappointed to smell that artifical grape smell that so many other reviewers picked up on, but I persevered. When I got home, I showered with sandalwood soap and oversprayed with abandon. I had no one to offend that afternoon except myself, and the weather was warm enough to open all the windows if the house needed an airing out afterward. \nBut after the grapey-ness softened, it evolved into something interesting. Not any jasmine on earth that I've smelled, but some kind of narcotic night-blooming white flower, a touch of sweetness from an overripe purple fruit, and that beautiful woody base.  \nHighly huffable. Wonderfully diffusive. I can see how this can be a polarizing scent, though. Dark and powerful, very synthetic, very loud. Unlike anything else I've smelled. \nIt lingers on clothes forever. The dress I was wearing the day I bought it will probably reek of it until laundry day. Stays on skin until the next shower. I appreciate this kind of staying power. \nI woke up the next day in a sweet haze of Alien, and I love it for that. Not something to wear to work because I'm a nurse. Something to wear to bed to block out all the things I've had to smell during the day, or to wear a drop of when I'm in a scorpio kind of mood, or to wear on dates because this is the kind of perfume that I imagine would be delicious to smell in your bed the morning after... and the day after that and the day after that."}, "14": {"0": "When I sprayed this on myself, a third testicle was born in my crotch\nThis is a work of art\nThe original Sauvage was more common than drugs in Hollywood, the air in Earth's atmosphere is made up of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 350% Sauvage\nBut Elixir, helped my baby cheeks and chicken chest to be filled with manly hair just after touching the package of the fragrance\nWhat a banger, you all need to try this, but only one spray, if you do more, 15 endemic species are going to die in Indonesia", "1": "People out here really try to say Elixir was reformulater ?

Yes, this fragrance even shares similar notes...the top notes have some similarities of other fragrances in this genre...but the mid and dry down turns into Oud for Greatness in my opinion. Every nose is different and how it comes off our skin may smell different to others too. \n\nIn all honesty, this fragrance is a \"banger\" and will garner lots of attention from women worn by the right man or woman if she prefers more masculine smelling scents. My wife loves this on me and she says it smells great! So, that really means a lot because my wife is very picky when it comes to fragrances...she prefers fresh scents as most women do; however, this fragrance morphs and changes on me by the hour...it's last about 9 hours thus far with about 2 hours projection and 3-4 hours of with regard to scent trail.

If I smell my arm it's a skin scent. Pleasantly surprised it made it this far. On my shirt it's still strong.\n\n24 hours later I can\u2019t pick it up in my arm.

The opening of Elixir is straight maple syrup when then goes away after 5-10 minutes. For the next couple of hours I'm hit with pepper/incense/lavender/cardamom/orange. And when I say \"hit\", I should say it's a bomb! It's very strong and can be sickly if you spray too much. \n\nThe pepper and cardamom seem to be the dominant notes with a hint of lavender for the duration of the fragrance. I'm catching faint similarities to Xerjoff Golden Green with the cardamom/lavender they are using. This is a good thing because Golden Green is on my Mt. Rushmore and I'm a sucker for this type of vibe!\n\nOverall I'm getting 8-ish hours of longevity and not the all-day performance some of you are getting. I am kinda jealous of the ones getting all-day out of this because I really do like it!\n\nElixir is not a young fragrance and is more suited for someone more mature. It's a little pricy but with how much longevity this gives and how much it projects, you'll only need a few sprays per wear and can make the 60ml last quite a while. I'm not a fan of the price tag but for what this does, it does very well. Is it worth the price?? That has yet to be seen.\n\nGet a decant before buying so you're not caught off guard. \n\nCheers!\n\nEdit: Ok.....perhaps I'm getting more than 8 hours and just going nose-blind! I wore this right out of the shower yesterday morning with 5 sprays...one on each clavicle, one behind each ear, and one on top of my head (bald). I caught wafts for a good part of the day and lost the scent when my wife and I made dinner. I changed into my pj's and put the clothes i was wearing next to my side of the bed. I woke up a few times during the night and could immediately smell it. When I woke up today I put on the shirt I wore yesterday and it was still there projecting!!!", "24": "$167 retail at Dillard' and it\u2019s being released on August 20th, 2021.

I'm not a fan of the Sauvage line but when I smelt Elixir I was instantly blown away. I didn't want to like it because I didn't want to wear any Sauvage but this one is a masterpiece. Demachy's last work will be remembered as one of the best scents of all time along with DHP. 60 ml lasts forever since you only have to apply 2-3 sprays maximum. This lasts 12 hours easily, days and weeks on clothes so those complaining about price have no idea about quality and performance. Not sure why Elixir gets compared to Initio's Oud for Greatness because these two smell nothing alike. 10/10.\nP.S. It is a compliment magnet, a compliment beast. Women love it. Have never received so many unsolicited compliments.", "26": "My second review on this beauty. People complain about the price for what you get but its stronger than 99% of fragrances on the market. It only requires a single spray for all day performance. People will stop you to ask what you are wearing. It's not similar to the other members of the Sauvage line at all so people that despise Sauvage need not worry. This is a formal, upscale scent that you would wear for fine dining or a romantic rendezvous with a cherished loved one. It deserves all the praise it gets. Also if you want a really awesome experience layer it with one of the other members of the Sauvage line for a more sporty and warm weather friendly smell. You will receive compliments galore. This stuff is a treasure and I really hope they never reformulate or discontinue it. This is what Sauvage should have been from the beginning and the others should have just been fresher sportier flankers to be honest. This scent is truly worthy of the Dior name.", "27": "Reminds me of a better version of Oud for Greatness, which I like, but I absolutely love Sauvage Elixir.  This is easy in my top 10.   Everyone says it too expensive, but is well worth the price.  I wish it cost more so everyone and his brother won't be wearing it.   10/10", "28": "I LOOOOOOVE Sauvage, ive purchased all three flankers along with the soap and after shave \ud83d\ude01. cant wait to try out this one.", "29": "Honestly at @Chanel de Lanvin yeah I have no idea why everyone is jumping on the boat of saying this has a passing resemblance to Drakkar Noir either. I own and wear Drakkar Noir on occasion and have worn it for a very long time and I can tell you honestly when I smelled this I wasn't even remotely reminded of Drakkar Noir. Most Drakkar Noir wearers who have worn it for most of their lives will say the same. It feels like the need to identify it as inspired by Drakkar Noir is probably because Drakkar Noir is so easily accessible and people's first if not only reference for an 80s foug\u00e8re that was made curious to new fragrance enthusiasts by Gents Scents. \n\nTo me this is just a modern sporty shower gel type of scent with strong performance and is pretty good in its own right. \n\nI blame Steven from Redolessence for the poor comparison and the floods of people who now believe they smell it (Drakkar Noir) in this. To be honest he was probably one of the first reviewers to receive a sample of this and was eager to get the video out so that he could be the first to review it and as a result made that comparison pretty abruptly being a first impression. I can't tell you how many bad blind-buys I've made or good fragrances I've missed based on his recommendations. But that's besides the point.\n\nI like this stuff but the price is not making it easy for me to justify getting it yet. It still has the same designer-ish mettalic quality that fragrances in PDM have and I totally see the comparisons to the nutmeg and lavender sharpness in Oud For Greatness which would be better references for how this smells. Those are overpriced and so is this.\n\nBut I do like it!!", "30": "Was smelling fragrances at the department store counter when an employee waved me over to his station. He had a little sprayer (tiny) of elixir.  He said \u201cwe don\u2019t have any in stock, but we are signing people up for preorders to be delivered to their homes.\u201d It was $155 for 2 ounces. He sprayed some on my hand. \nI should say, I have Sauvage EDP and I don\u2019t care for it. It is, to my nose, screechy and unpleasant. \nI have been wearing Elixr for about 2 hours and I am surprised how much I like it. I find it to be much darker and smoother that what I own.", "31": "In answer to all the comments about the performance of this fragrance, here is my experience (I\u2019m fuming).\n\nWhen I used the official samples from July 2021, one single spray lasted three weeks, I would still get compliments 2 weeks after that one magical spritz. It was so glorious and so strong that I would carry a hazmat suit in my car for those occasions and whip it out when the chemical attack sirens went off. My nights were filled with sound sleep and beautiful dreams of dancing in the sky, unicorns and happiness.\n\nSo finally I decided to pull the trigger and bought a bottle of this exclusive juice directly from Dior (batch FCK0FF) but when I tried it my whole world came tumbling down. Red mist. Drama and more red mist. SE had been severely watered down on purpose. So immediately I asked to God, knees on the ground, arms up: why me? \n\nEven after 17 sprays I smell nothing, just a faint whisper of a light scent for around 2-3 minutes. Not even a shadow of what the samples promised. In my desperation I often take the press cap off and spray straight into my nostrils, but still barely detect it. \n\nThis is a scam of evil proportions and the executives at Dior must be living a lavish life in the South of France, spending all the profits, drinking wine, fooling everyone and laughing hysterically whilst I\u2019m forced to snort their scented water directly into my brain. I call revolution and boicot, a crime is clearly being committed here.\n\n\u2026 Ok, I hope I\u2019ve made my point. This is how people are starting to sound and my advice to some of them, based on their comments and apparent state of panic, is to speak to a professional before their minds get completely unhinged and hurt themselves or someone else.\n\nSauvage Elixir has been out just a year. Dior is a reputable institution with decades of experience and probably one of the most transparent in the business when it comes to reformulations, so chill, don\u2019t lose your mind just yet, take a deep breath and enjoy this truly great fragrance.\n\n\u2601\ufe0f\ud83d\udecc\ud83d\udca4\ud83e\udd84\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udf38", "32": "I received this as a Christmas present and it was my scent of the day also. This in my opinion is a polarizing masterpiece by Dior. It's a blend of classic and modern that creates a massive scent bubble that commands attention from everyone around you.\n\nMost Designer's houses have their \u201cprivate line\u201d of fragrances that even most in the fragrance community are unfamiliar with. Dior could\u2019ve easily taken this route and this would\u2019ve been released without much fanfare. Dior decided to bring a \u201cNiche\u201d level quality scent and market it to the masses under the Sauvage name, which will cause a domino effect. Can\u2019t wait to see Chanel\u2019s response!", "33": "I don\u2019t think many people in these comments have a great knowledge of perfume concentrations. Lowest to highest: Eau fraiche, Eau de Cologne, Eau de toilette, Eau de Parfum, extrait/extract de Parfum, pure perfume. Sauvage Parfum is not a pure perfume concentration and is likely not even an extrait. It\u2019s probably just an edp marketed as a \u201cparfum.\u201d Same with with the other designer \u201cparfum\u201d releases. Usually designer scents under $150 only go up to an edp concentration. Marketing departments don\u2019t care about the actual concentration of fragrances. They stick a name on something to get more sales.", "34": "Wow this is one good scent. If anyone is complaining about a scent not performing, this is your guy. I burned my arm where I sprayed Elixir on which required a skin graft. After I woke up from surgery it was still in the mid part of the scent and you could smell that beautiful lavender and licorice blend of greatness. I love this fragrance.", "35": "Waiting for niche snobs to show up and bash this \nFYI..nobody force niche  snobs to try it", "36": "The best Sauvage since the original! Elixir retains the sharp citrus, and punchy, spicy opening of the EDT, but achieves it with warm spices like nutmeg and cinnamon rather than pepper. To me, that's where the similarity to the EDT ends - Elixir doesn't have that screechy, metallic vibe, and while it still feels classically 'designer', it doesn't have the loud ambroxan. Make no mistake, the performance is still incredible, but the mid is far more classically foug\u00e8re with the lavender. Combined with the amber, I do see a slight similarity to TF Beau de Jour. Into the dry-down, you get that slightly sweet, soft sandalwood, hence the comparisons with PdM Layton, but this is far spicier, punchier, and less vanillic. Elixir has that aniseed accord reminiscent of liquorice, and is also much earthier with the vetiver and patchouli.\n\nThis feels like an improvement on the Parfum, with performance to match the EDT. For those who find the EDT too loud, obnoxious, youthful, or ubiquitous, this would be a great alternative (at the expense of your wallet)!", "37": "Impressive farewell to the perfume master Demachy with a position at DIOR.\nA scent for men, not boys.\nBRAV\u00d3 MAESTRO!", "38": "Sampled this at the mall. Sprayed one spray on my wrist and as soon as I smelled it I was caught off guard. It doesn\u2019t smell anything like any of the other flankers. It is it\u2019s own stand alone fragrance. After I let it dry down I couldn\u2019t stop smelling my wrist. It is truly addicting and a masterpiece. You get hit with loads of spices, cinnamon being prominent. The lavender and nutmeg blend perfectly. It\u2019s creamy, sweet and spicy. It smells gentleman like and I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be a beast in the fall and winter. Projects like a beast 1-2 sprays max only needed. Got 2 compliments the first time I wore it if you guys care about that stuff.  Must try!", "39": "I owned Sauvage EDT, I LIKED it, but it was sometimes it felt quite harsh and metallic.\nI owned Sauvage EDP, I LIKED it a little more than EDT (maybe because of my age 36) but it felt a bit more refined.\nI owned Sauvage Parfum, I really DISLIKED it (sold it the next day after blind buying), far to much vanilla for me.\nI received Elixir yesterday and here is my 2 pence worth...\n\nIf you are 30 years plus, this fragrance is absolutely phenomenal and by far the best \"flanker\" in the Sauvage line. That doesn't mean if you are lucky enough to be in your teens or 20's that you cant wear it, but it most definitely feels more \"mature\". It has a subtle Sauvage DNA, but feels like an extremely well refined fragrance from the 80's. I sprayed it on my jumper yesterday and I have to admit I wasn't sold on it. However, I wanted to give it a proper wearing today on my skin and I have to say... it is absolutely outstanding and I'm not exaggerating. I seen a suggestion from a comment that you should mist the sprays and not condense the sprays and I 100% agree, gentle misting in the usual areas (behind ears, wrists, back of the neck and back of the hand) it works perfectly. I think if you concentrate the spray to tightly, it comes across a little dominant.

Yes? No?\u2026 or is it simply that Dior is just reiterating a proven formula?\n\nAlso, are we to assume that Francois Demachy, a 73 year old master perfumer, never smelled a massively successful fragrance such as Drakkar Noir?\u2026 and if he did smell it, is he not, at the very least, influenced by it?\n\nIf we were talking about any other form of art or culture, we would be debating between appreciation vs appropriation\u2026 why is perfumery exempt from such a consideration?\n\nAnyway\u2026 you have the information, you can answer all of the above questions by for yourselves\u2026\n\nNow, to the review.\n\nSauvage Elixir is a spicy fougere perfume\u2026 it\u2019s Lavender/Vetiver centric, which is a bit dated, but at the same time they managed to make it current and urgent by adding the spices on top and licorice as a bottom to have it\u2019s aroma encompass the whole fragrance.\n\nIt\u2019s warm, rounded, spicy, herbal, and slightly sweet\u2026 a linear but delicious scent!\n\nThis perfume leans completely masculine\u2026 It\u2019s really hard to picture a woman using it, however, many women rave about feeling very sexy using it\u2026 perhaps it would be a bit more unisex if layered with some flowers or musk, or even dialing up on the sandal.\n\nProjection is moderate and persistent\u2026 Longevity is around 8 hours.\n\nAn amazing fragrance, even for those of us who don\u2019t like fougere perfumery!!

That\u2019s for all of you to think about.", "41": "I my opinion the first minutes of this fragrance is too much, but after a while the middel and base notes gets more noticible and it gets even better. One of the best fragrances i have smelled.", "42": "This is really great! For the first 25 minutes or so, I get a beautiful Christmas tree smell. It's just lovely. Then, the Christmas tree smell gives way to a spiced, holiday version of Sauvage edp. Picture pouring Sauvage edp into a warm saucepan with cinnamon sticks and freshly ground nutmeg, letting them steep, and then filtering and bottling the marinated concoction. That's how I experience the smell of Sauvage Elixer.", "43": "I am going to get crucified for this, but this smells very bad to me. It reminds me of potpourri, my grandmother uses as a toilet freshener. I just cannot not smell my grandmother's toilet, whenever I smell this. I have two samples and have sampled it four times now. I just cannot get myself to like it. This has nothing to do with the EdT or EdP.\n\nThe projection and longevity are out of this world.\n\nLet the downvoting begin! :)", "44": "My expectations for this release were low - so many fragrance houses play it safe by churning out multiple versions on the same theme with only slight variations in the note breakdown - but I can honestly say that this caught me by surprise to the extent that it has compelled me to write my first review, after many years of being an interested onlooker.\n\nYes, it has an overall vibe that is reminiscent of the 80s powerhouses, but this is a thoroughly modern fragrance, with a complexity and quality that will have the other big hitters - Chanel, YSL, Gucci, Armani et al - panicking and no doubt deconstructing it in an attempt to copy and keep up.\n\nIt opens with the zing of grapefruit, followed by the sharp darkness of licorice, then the smooth creaminess of sandalwood, as the vibrant lavender and aromatic patchouli notes come through to balance it all out.\n\nThe spiciness develops as the elixir settles - the cardamom is muted here - this isn't the in your face cardamom bomb blast that welcomes you to Cartier's Declaration (which I actually love) - no, this is more of a stealth bomb where the spice dials in just as you're getting your head around everything else that's going on.\n\nThe sweet cinnamon note then moves front and centre and everything else orbits around it. It's not the candied cinnamon found in the much derided (unfairly, in my opinion) Joop Homme - no, this is the sultry, dry, spicy cinnamon of Est\u00e9e Lauder's groundbreaking Cinnabar.\n\nProjection is massive - a sales assistant I walked past told me she could smell me from the other end of the department floor. I can go nose blind to heavy fragrances, but not this one - I was enveloped in a cocoon of fresh oriental spiciness for the rest of the evening; sometimes getting a hint of grapefruit before it disappeared, then the licorice surprising me along with the vetiver and patchouli as time went on. \n\nLongevity is excellent - I can still faintly smell it 18 hours after spraying. This truly is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nThe original Sauvage DNA is present here, but this is best thought of as a stand-alone. It's a game changer in the same way Bleu de Chanel was when first released, but this will have less mass appeal - not everyone wants something as complex and challenging as this. \n\nAll in all - a resounding success from Francois Demachy. Bravo, sir!\n\n\nAddendum: I can't think of anything that's similar to this in its entirety - there's a bit of Sauvage Parfum in there, a hint of a homage to Cinnabar and YSL's Opium, the sweet stickiness of Joop Homme and the initial fresh kappow!! of vintage Drakkar Noir (not in the notes per se, but more in the full frontal assault on the senses that it delivered back in the 80's).", "45": "This was finally available on Dior.com US, just received it with overnight shipping.\nThis is perhaps the '80s version of Sauvage. It's very different from the other iterations. It reminds me slightly of Lapidus Pour Homme, in it's density, lavender and base notes. The DNA of Sauvage is certainly there, but this is very different from all the others. To me this perhaps smells the least like the Parfum version, not sure why so many are making that comparison, it has none of the smokiness of the Parfum. Calling this an Elixir seems very fitting it's like the original was distilled, compressed and boiled down to the syrupy nectar of the scent. It's a beautiful and somewhat daring release.

I actually love this scent so much that I bought a backup of it already. I find it cozy, sweet and warm. Longevity on me is awesome, lasting into the next day.

The only way you don't like this is if it doesn't work with your skin chemistry, your are not into spicey frags or certain notes which are highlighted in this or you simply have bad taste. lol. \nThis scent is in the style of Spicebomb meets Tobacco Vanille. It's beautiful and could easily be an alternative to those TF scents if their price tags turned you off from them. It reminds me so much of a designer version of TV that calling it similar to One Million is an insult to this scent. There's no way one should confuse this with that if you were to smell it on someone. It's Dark...It's Sophisticated...It's Rich...totally the opposite of One Million. It is actually the anti One Million. It may even be far superior to its original scent SpiceBomb which itself is a very good designer fragrance. I personally prefer this over the original because its more masculine, denser and I love the smokey resinous tobacco, vanilla and pepper combination. It almost has an incense vibe to it.  \nIdeally this is a night time scent. I'd wear it during the day as well but this would be best worn at night. As someone mentioned before this could've been called SPICEBOMB NOIR and would've fit perfectly. The word \"Extreme\" obviously tests better in marketing surveys though. I'd consider this strictly a cool/cold weather scent though it can be worn at nights during the spring as well. So to me its sort of versatile since you could reasonably wear it 3 of 4 seasons. The knocks on this is it's synthetic (but so is every Frag including Niche these days) and isn't versatile- besides being a no go in the summer it better suits a style forward look. If you go casual with it, dont go sloppy and im sure you will get a couple compliments wearing it. \nLongevity is great also. It last 9+ hours on my skin and really projects during the first 3-4 hours. After that it became less potent but never quite became a skin scent on me until about hour 6-7. It will however linger longer on clothes which is great for me as i like to spray the inside of my tshirts.  \nI just truly think people are not appreciating what a great fragrance this is. One of the best offerings in 2015 by a designer house without question. If Tom Ford put this in bottles, the love rating would be far greater than its likes or dislikes. Or probably not, as some might say he did this already...lol. This scent wowed me and the original didn't. The original is a boy. This Extreme Flanker is that boy as a man.  \n9/10- Im biased on this one because I love good sweet tobacco scents... \n8/10- if i were being totally unbiased. \nYouTube Channel- Simply Put Scents", "4": "Wow, this smells a lot more like the original than i though it would do. But in a totally better way. This one really deserves its Extreme moniker unlike many others... \nDo not pass this one by, this really is a hidden gem. Niche quality at designer price. Great signature scent for winter; I dont even care if it gets compliments or not this is a love at fist sniff with great performance. One of the best in my collection, a perfect 10", "5": "LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT !!!!! \nNo spicy tobacco in designer game is better made than this!\nNich\u00e9 quality and roundness", "6": "I'm going to be honest. I bought this because one of the fragrance reviewers I watched literally shot this into his mouth because it was so good >_>\n\nI wanted to smell like that guy! So I had to buy a bottle of Spicebomb. And it has changed my whole aspect on spicy/sweet fragrances. The opening is so candy like. It reminded me of Christmas nights where family would get together and have some cognac smoke cigars while grandmas baking pumpkin pie in the oven!\n\nThis fragrance is incredible! It leans more towards the gourmand side. For some reason the opening always reminds me of fresh baked pie haha. I get plenty of Vanilla and Tobacco. Also, I get some cinnamon spice from this too. Just may be my nose playing tricks on me.\n\nThe Scent: 10/10\nQuality :  10/10\nPrice :    10/10 (You're getting insane longevity and projection on this, I don't know how anyone can complain).", "7": "Spicebomb extreme these days is still as strong as the 2015 batch and is NOT reformulated!! I wear them all these lasts 2 months and there is no difference! \nIt is the designer Winter King of tobacco and vanille. \n\nI have the Vintage 2015 batch 38M33E. \n\n2018=62R40DS,and 62r70DD and 62r71DR they are just the same amazing fragrance as my:\n\n2019/01 batch 62S10D9.\n\nAbsolute No difference in smell, projection and longevity. Still very good! Don't listen to the bad longevity stories and pick it up until it's to late!! Reformulation Will happen for sure as With every fragrance after 3,4 years. For now it hasn't!!! \n\nLasts Arround 6-10 hours on skin and days on clothes. \nProjects about 1-2 hours strongly. Than becomes a skin scent but still very present. Original Spicebomb projects just a little bit better. \n\nThe 2015 untill 2019 all have the same formula code on the box: (I think it is: B197686/1) I compared every letter, number and it is on the same position on the backside of the box.. Nothing has changed since 2015.", "8": "It's reminiscent of the original Spicebomb to me, but I'm not sure I would have called it Extreme. It seems more deep and dark than the original. Quite spicy, that's for sure. Spicebomb Noir would have been more fitting I think. ;-)\n\nIt reminds me of something that I can't quite put my finger on. My initial impression of the heart was that this could have been the lovechild of Spicebomb and A*Men Pure Havane. It starts out somewhat fresh, but still it's more intense than the original Spicebomb.\n\nI will do a side by side comparison with the original soon, to get a fair idea of performance on this one. To me it seems a little subdued compared to the original, but that's no surprise considering this is an eau de parfum concentration. They usually tend to be more dense and warm.\n\nAs for the bottle, I know many people find the grenade a bit tacky but I'm not bothered by it. But the colorscheme of thise one is definitely an improvement over the original!\n\nWould I get a bottle based on this first impression? Well actually, yes, I think I would.", "9": "greyhoundmom has it right: \"...was surprised to find that it smells almost exactly like TF Tobacco Vanille!\" Yes, I think so, too. A tamer version of TF TV but very much in the same vibe. Very strongly tobacco and vanilla - not so much spice. (The pepper note is very downplayed.)  I like it. I like it better than Spicebomb, in fact.\n\nIt's also a cousin to CK Shock, I think.\n\nMy wife's comment was, \"It's okay. At least it's not soapy like a lot of the others.\"", "10": "The unicorn of fragrances. I've been trying to find this damn thing for two years with no luck. Well, I went on a shopping trip to a rather distant mall with my wife last week and there it was at Sephora. Begging to be bought, it appeared fully stocked as if a new shipment had come in. $120 bones for a blind buy? Tempting and not at the same time, I've slowed way down on buying frags so I figured, why not? I can't find it anywhere and it's perpetually expensive. With that said, fantastic sprayer, corny but endearing bottle with the \"grenade pin\" stopper.\n\nThe name precedes the fragrance and bottle as the first spray is for sure a bomb but not necessarily a grenade, more of the nuclear variety. My entire bedroom (and myself) smelled of an absolutely fantastic vanilla/tobacco/spice combo. The spice is heavy in the first ten minutes until it settles into a spicy vanilla/tobacco. It doesn't change much, it doesn't need to. The spice subsides but never fully goes away. The vanilla and tobacco the big stars. This, in the few wearings I've given it, is one of my favorite fragrances in my collection. Absolutely amazing. I don't particularly get any big dose of lavender but I could see it being a part of the concoction, caraway absent. I haven't worn (briefly smelled on paper) any of the other iterations of Spicebomb but whoever suggested Robert Graham \"Fortitude\" as a similarity is pretty on point. This is definitely sweeter but in a sense, this is what I imagine a less uptight version of \"Fortitude\" would be. My wife highly approved and for such an expensive blind buy, that speaks volumes.\n\nPerformance is also on point here. I get a consistent 10+ hours of longevity, way more on clothing. The projection, on the other hand, is deceiving. The first hour or two is nuclear but after that it's very noticeable but subdued. This is by no means a bad thing. Those around you will smell it and like it, it just doesn't beg for attention. I would definitely put this in date category but you could pull this off for formal or casual occasions as well. It's a damn fine versatile scent. Even in a warmer fall temperature, this is fresh enough for wear though the performance takes a hit. Overall, though an expensive blind buy, one I don't regret at all.", "11": "Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb Extreme Men EDP opens with a strong projection of very sweet, tobacco, and spicy notes. The opening is delectable, spicy, bold, dense, and very pleasant. The vanilla and tobacco are at the top of the notes; the vanilla is very sweet and aromatic, it makes the tobacco note very palatable and takes away any darkness from the fragrance. The tobacco is a prominent note, but it isn\u2019t pungent, it comes across as mild tobacco note as opposed to blond or black tobacco. The pepper is next, a noticeable note, but not as strong as the vanilla or tobacco. Not far behind is the caraway, a particular note with a nutty, bittersweet, anise and mild licorice touch, and it gives the fragrance a unique touch. As the fragrance dries down, the initial projection intensifies, at this point, the fragrance feels dry but very projecting. The fragrance is relatively linear, other than a brief opening lavender touch, and the fragrance that becoming dry, all featured notes come up as soon as it is sprayed and they continue into the dry-down. Once Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb Extreme Men EDP has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a strong projection, very sweet (vanilla), tobacco, and spicy (pepper, caraway) fragrance. The fragrance feels bold, casual, dense, elegant, formal, heavy, high-quality, imposing, intense, inviting, long-lasting, masculine, rich, sweet, syrupy, unique, warm, and very pleasant.\n\nBATCH REVIEWED: 2020 (#62T10DH).\nWOW RATING: 10/10. An impressive and unique fragrance, nicely balanced.\nDISLIKE RATING: 3/10. The tobacco and spicy notes are noticeable.\nUNIQUENESS: 10/10. The combination of notes, and particularly the caraway makes the fragrance unique.\nMASS APPEAL: 8/10. This is a fragrance that most people will enjoy.\nPROJECTION: 6/10. Very good, about 6 feet around the wearer.\nSILLAGE: 6/10. Very good, about 6 feet behind the wearer.\nAPPLICATION: 4 atomizations.\nLONGEVITY: 6/10. Very good, about 6 hours with 4 hours of consistent projection.\nSEASONS: Winter, fall, colder days, and climate-controlled environments.\nOCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office, casual, holidays, vacations, romantic, dating, clubbing. This is an office-friendly fragrance. \nVERSATILITY: 5/10. Moderate, a good fragrance for cold weather and casual wear.\nGENDER: Masculine, the tobacco note gives the fragrance a masculine character.\nAGES: Any.\nRECOMMENDATION: Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb Extreme Men EDP can be purchased for about $120, those that are looking for a sweet wearable tobacco fragrance, will find here a great option. On a side note, this fragrance does not feature spices but tobacco and vanilla. The name may be a bit misleading.\nBLIND-BUY: Yes, but only if you are familiar with its main notes.\nSIMILAR: These are examples of fragrances in the same genre. Amouage Memoir Men EDP is a good niche tobacco fragrance; Animale \u201cAnimale\u201d Men EDT is a very sweet, fruity, floral, green, tobacco fragrance with great performance; Azzaro Wanted by Night EDP is fantastic very sweet, cinnamon, fruity/citrusy, leathery, tobacco and incense accords; Burberry London is a moderate performance, tobacco, cinnamon, and woods scent; Calvin Klein One Shock is a popular tobacco fragrance but moderate quality; Chanel Egoiste is a bold, black tobacco, and woods fragrance; Cuba Royal is a great tobacco-based fragrance and very affordable; Dolce & Gabbana The One EDP is a very good, spicy, cardamom, fruity, and tobacco fragrance; John Varvatos Dark Rebel is a more wearable woody, leathery, tobacco, spices, and boozy fragrance; John Varvatos Dark Rebel Rider this fragrance is dark with incense, tobacco and leather notes, but low performance; Mancera Red Tobacco EDP is a strong projection, mildly sweet, ambery, tobacco, oud, cinnamon, and saffron fragrance; Nishane Fan Your Flames is a great niche fragrance featuring rum, tobacco, woody and tonka accords; Thierry Mugler Angel A*Men Pure Havana may be one of the best bold and sweet tobacco-based designer fragrances; Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb Extreme Men EDP is a very good, unique, strong, vanilla, tobacco, pepper, and caraway fragrance.\nSUMMARY: A strong projection, very sweet (vanilla), tobacco, and spicy (pepper, caraway) fragrance. The fragrance feels bold, casual, dense, elegant, formal, heavy, high-quality, imposing, intense, inviting, long-lasting, masculine, rich, sweet, syrupy, unique, warm, and very pleasant.", "12": "I've to say, a week after buying it, that this fragrance is one of the most beautiful things I have smelled (please consider that I'm new into fragrances). I feel a lot of spices in the opening (it's strong but I like it, it may be not so good for everyone), in a few minutes you can start to smell the vanilla that will take the lead from there. I just took a good warm bath and decided to spray it just to smell it again, made myself a good cup of coffee to appreciate with the fragrance and that is the perfect mood.\n\nLongevity is about 10 hours for me, haven't tried it for longer than that without showering.\nHowever the projection is good for about 2,5/3 hours, after that I dont feel it too strong but I can still smell it sometimes (maybe I get noseblind, not sure).\n\nMy bottle is from August/2021.\nI can't tell if that is stronger or weaker than previous batches, it's the first time that I own it and tried it (it was a blind buy after trying the original spicebomb).\n\nIt's now my favorite fragrance, absolutely loved it.", "13": "No need for a long review. This is my favorite sweet/spicy/tobacco fragrance in this price range, and even above. It strikes a great balance between those three elements. I prefer it to TF Tobacco Vanille, which I find too sweet for my tastes. For me this is a perpetual rebuy and a must try if you enjoy this style of fragrance.\n\nNow the fun part: Thumbs up if you ever pulled the atomizer off because you forgot it doesn\u2019t have a cap. \ud83e\udd23", "14": "This scent is beautiful but I do not love it on me. I wish it had less vanilla and more prominent spices. The tobacco note is lovely. Too sweet for my taste but a well composed fragrance.", "15": "Got mine today i really liked it,\nto me it has a more masculine vibe \nthan the previous  versions as i do\nlike the tobacco vibe, it reminds me\nof my grandfathers tobacco pipe, it smells great\nin my opinion. Tried the original on the other hand it\ndid not last as long, and i found this far superior, this \nwas a lot better than i had expected \nthis is a great scent I FREAKIN LOVE IT ;)", "16": "When I got hold of this I wore it every day for a week including to work, mainly because it will not come off your clothes. A great dichotomy of sweet vanilla and astringent lavender and caraway seeds. There is not very much middle ground although I do detect a note very similar to that in TF Noir Extreme, maybe the cardamom kulfi note. \n\nAnyway, the packaging is awesome, the performance is excellent and you can find it online from legitimate retailers for relatively low prices. I was convinced by it enough to immediately buy a reserve bottle from the same place.", "17": "While Spicebomb Extreme, despite its name, is neither spicy nor extreme compared to the original, it is one of the best fragrances on the market, and is niche quality at a designer price point. \n\nWhile the original Spicebomb gives you a bold punch of pepper, saffron, and cinnamon in the opening, Extreme is much less piercing and the spices are toned down, instead with a much more prominent tobacco note. The tobacco is the main feature, but isn't skanky or dirty at all, but rich and floral. When I saw the vanilla in the note breakdown, I thought it would be a sweet tobacco fragrance from the start, like Pure Havane for example. But the vanilla starts off quite subtle, and I wouldn't say it's immediately a 'sweet' fragrance. Over the next three or fours hours, the vanilla comes through to give a nice warmth and sweetness.\n\nOver all, it feels more mature, smooth, and rounded than the original, and a better fragrance to me. The first fragrance I ever bought for myself, and reviewed on Fragrantica, was Spicebomb, so while I love it, I always wished it was sweeter and longer lasting. Extreme is everything I wished the original was, and perfect for everyone who wants a fantastic performing, rich, interesting fragrance perfect for the cold weather.", "18": "I got my bottle back in 2020 and have been enjoying it ever since. Contrary to what many suggest, I\u2019ve worn it in warm days where the vanilla and spices got amped up nicely. Just don\u2019t go nuts on the trigger and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nBut what\u2019s most interesting about this fragrance is the mass hysteria that it generates every winter when the discontinuation rumours kick in. It truly is something to buy popcorn about.\n\nA few months ago I tried to explain this phenomenon to one of the YouTubers who fuels the discontinuation rumours in such a way that you would think he has a direct line with the CEO of V&R. Argument is that this fragrance isn\u2019t prominently featured on the brand\u2019s Instagram feed as \u2018a clear sign\u2019 of its discontinuation. Yet the marketing department of V&R continue tu push SBE alongside other flacons on their regular ads. I think it\u2019s so popular that they don\u2019t even need to invest much time and effort promoting it to get it out of the door. \n\nTruth is, this fragrance is so sought after, at least here in Europe, that stocks are always low wherever you look, giving the impression of it being on its way out. The hype is real.\n\nSo, in preparation for this winter just wanted to say, don\u2019t panic, be patient and get yours before stocks run out again.\n\nLike I said: \ud83c\udf7f", "19": "Guinea54 - this is quite different from the original spicebomb. \n\nThicker, richer, more tabacoo, more vanilla, more chocolate and cocoa.  Almost a gourmand fragrance but still retains some of the original spicebomb DNA.  \n\nSpicebomb now has 3 different variants.  This one,  the original and a fresh version.  \n\nExtreme and the original are the ones to get.  Women love them and a little goes a long way.  You will get your moneys worth.", "20": "Definitely not Extreme by any sense of the word. However, SBE  is a beauty, and a must have for anyone that enjoys or wants a well composed tobacco/spice smelling cologne. SBE is very easy to wear, has a very high quality smell, well tamed, and very aromatic without being annoying. Excellent fall and winter fragrance with major swag appeal. \n\nScent: 9/10\nPerformance: 8/10 \nProjection: 7/10 \nLongevity: 8/10 (8-10+ hours consistently on me. Not sure why others have issues).", "21": "Spicebomb Extreme... oh man, this is a STAPLE for Canadian winters. This is the ultimate go-to winter fragrance. Superb quality in a bottle and in my opinion only suitable for fall/winter season makes this a little confined on the versatility scale. To the contrary, when it becomes cooler outside, you get excited to bust this one out.\n\nThe scent is addictive, sweet, cozy, and classy. This falls in the gourmand realm of fragrances, but the tobacco note is perfectly subtle to offset it and give it a balanced vibe. Outfit wise, this is very versatile. This is suitable for men 20+ in age as it does have a mature aspect to it. The projection and longevity are immense. I have a 2016 and a 2019 bottle and I can say they both perform equally; about 10 hours+ on clothing/next day smell on clothing. Compliment factor is a beast as well, this will get you noticed. I like this way more than the original Spicebomb. \n\nI am looking forward to wearing this again! I love the memories associated with a fragrance. The most memorable moment is when I was at a chalet in December 2019 (to jog your memory, this was before COVID-19) with a mix of friends, their friends & the neighbors and I had this scent on.

It's nice as well when you are well dressed at the office.\nThe performance is POWERFULL.", "23": "I cannot stress enough how wonderful this fragrance is. 10/10 for me, and I almost want to buy like 10 bottles just because it's already quite hard to find and what if they discontinue it.\n\nBeautiful!", "24": "They did Extreme right.\nThey took the original and made an Extreme version of the same scent, but made it more bold, deeper and fuller than the original. The original has a freshness to it, where this one is more on the dark side. To me this one smells better, and it performs very well! Very nice scent for the cold months.", "25": "I have a 2020 batch with batch code 62T10DH  Checked on checkfresh.com and it's from January 2020. Formulation code is still B197686/1.\n\nWhat a lovely scent.No reformulation. Still going strong. Bought 90ml and will never regret that.", "26": "I love this fragrance. It was a blind buy I got yesterday, as I thought the notes would appeal to my tastes. This review is from wearing it all day today.\n\nIt opens with a sharp spicy note on pepper and caraway. I sprayed once on my wrist and three times on my torso. That was probably too much as it was a bit overwhelming to my nose and caused me to sneeze a few times. Initial smell was one of wooden pencil shavings and a strong smell of caraway. I often cook with caraway when I making European Goulashes so that note was very noticeable to me. It almost smells like a spice shop for a good 30 minutes on my skin. After an hour or so, the vanilla and tobacco notes emerge more prominently and are held together by the lavender. On my skin the caraway note took about 4 hours to die off. It\u2019s an odd note, but not terrible. The smell that lingers for  at least 10 hours is one of vanilla, tobacco and soft lavender. It has a middle level of sweetness.\n\nThis is a cooler weather scent and probably more for nighttime. I actually think this is ok for most age groups, maybe better for the younger person or young at heart. I\u2019m mid 50s and think I can manage this fragrance! It\u2019s more masculine, but I think some women could wear this. \n\nIt would be a definite re-buy for me, but I suspect that my new bottle will last some time as I will use it lightly and probably not for everyday use such as the office. I\u2019m happy to have this in my collection and will reach for my little grenade bottle when I feel I need to spice things up! Haha.", "27": "Spicebomb Extreme is incredibly great!\n\nIt is very spicy, warm, sweet, alluring, and smooth. An awesome combination of vanilla, black pepper, and tobacco here, with the caraway and lavender hiding in the background. It is one of the best fragrances incorporating those notes to me, even when compared to fragrances with more than 2x the price of this one.\n\nLasts for a very long time too, and the projection is great for the first 4 hours on my skin. It then becomes a strong skin scent for another 4 to 6 hours. I'd even wear this on a summer day, but with less sprays.\n\nThe quality of this fragrance is through the roof, especially for a designer fragrance. Everything about this fragrance, from the scent, bottle, to the atomiser itself, has a really high quality.\n\nIt has been on my wishlist for more than 3 years now and I knew I loved it so much when I first sprayed it, but I can't believe I just bought the full-bottle of it right now.\n\nAnd no, I don't think it smells very close to Mercedes-Benz Club Black. Club Black doesn't have the spiciness of Spicebomb Extreme. Also, it doesn't smell like Herod to me, as Spicebomb Extreme doesn't have that smokiness and a cherry accord of Herod and Herod doesn't have as intense spiciness from the black pepper and it doesn't have as much sweetness from the vanilla.", "28": "One of the very very few fragrances that's actually worth the hype. It is really good and pleasant and lasts a decent amount.", "29": "Yes some people think it\u2019s overrated and some people don\u2019t,\nAll I\u2019ve got to say is my girlfriend legit gets turned on just from the smell. This is the most perfect Winter/fall date night/sex fragrance.", "30": "This is just pure class. I just got myself a 50ml bottle an hour ago. I will use it as a casual scent for daily use this cold season. As I said, it is sweet and spicy and I see myself wearing during holidays with a wooly sweater. Very cozy and warming scent.\n\nPerformance so far it's crazy. I have a 2019 batch and it just projects that it choked my dog out, he kept sneezing when I got home lol.\n\nI get a lot of vanilla, tobacco and lavender. Lots of lavender. Overall a nice scent and looking forward to wearing it.", "31": "Wow! Check out the steep upward trend on the Fragrantica graph showing the recent level of interest in this scent. It really is as good as the reviews say, but before you buy it know this: if you are looking for this type of scent profile, Mercedes Club Black smells every bit as good, performs better, comes in a slightly bigger bottle and can be bought for around half the price. You can\u2019t go wrong with either fragrance but V&R is a little over-priced for what you are getting. Just my opinion for what it\u2019s worth.", "32": "Absolutely gorgeous.", "33": "Tobacco, vanilla, and pepper. Every man should have this one. Absolute masterpiece. Certified head turner that lasts LONG.", "34": "My god what a gorgeous frag. Vanilla laced pepper. The opening is quite intense, and I think could be off-putting to some people. However, it quickly dries down to a beautiful spicy vanilla type smell. Longevity is nuts. 2-3 sprays, and it will project wildly for the first 1-2 hours, then moderate projection for another 2-3 hours after that. Longevity is a solid 10+ hours for me. Really good stuff.", "35": "SBE's been getting a lot of hype as late for a good reason. This is one of my newer fragrances in my collection and haven't done a ton of wearings, but it lasted a full workday and strongly projected for about 3 hrs or so. As far the smell is concerned, you get that spiciness up top along with a great dose of cinnamon, vanilla and tobacco.\n\nWhat sets this apart from the rest is the addition of grapefruit and how it works so well to balance everything out. It's not overly sweet, spicy, or 'tobaccoey' at all and the grapefruit gives it a hint of freshness.\n\nAfter spraying it on my hand when I first got it and after 1 wearing, I'd rate this a solid 8.5/10. It is a bit pricey when you buy retail and it's a bit hard to find in the grey market. Finally, I will say this is blind buy approved. If you're looking for a winter fragrance that smells and performs great, Spicebomb Extreme is an excellent choice.", "36": "im the type to click NO when I see Other fragrances that resembles this before I start a review", "37": "One of the best fragrances on earth\n\nLongevity 8 hour +\nSillage moderate\nProjection moderate\n\nThe scent : 10/10 perfect already\n\nEvening scent only, do not use in the afternoon :)\n\nWanginya enak bgt gan, recommended Abis!!!!\n\nTop!

Like DAMN nice! \nI hate the original Spicebomb which might sound weird because they\u2019re  similar but this extreme has amped up vanilla which makes a massive difference for me since I dig that note.  Heavily reminds me of Tobacco Vanille but this is much smoother and doesn\u2019t have the annoying clove or almost ginger like vibes going on. Nowhere near has this got that spice cupboard vibe either. So smooth and just an addictive scent. Performance is crazy good. Projection on this is amazing. If this was from a niche house it would rival TV  and the likes with ease. Not sure how this one didn\u2019t catch on. Noting not sure either when it came out here in Australia but it took ages and finally glad it\u2019s in the shops now.

It begins quite medicinal (because it's fresh spicey) and then a woody note kicks in. After the woody note I quickly become aware of vanilla on one side and lavender joining on the other side. If I sniff very hard I could make out a little tobacco, but this perfume is by no means smokey. It's a fresh tabacco which I like. \n\n* After a while on paper *\nIt's VERY woody and the vanilla has completely taken over the ship with some lavender.\nThe tobacco chilling on the deck.\nAfter a very long time vanilla is king. :P\n\n* My womanly 28 y/o opinion *\nI don't mind it, but it doesn't draw my attention. It's a safe choice for any age starting from 20. Would I do you?  Only if you also have a nice smile.\n\n* What kind of man do I imagine *\nIt doesn't make you smell like suddenly you're the only man alive, but you are a comfortable choice who I might not regret having a one night stand with. You smell like someone who still can comfortably be friends with benefits whilst being an actual friend. I'd say it makes one smell reliable, because it is masculine, but not too. A calm guy, but not shy.\nI think of 80's boy toy types. The ones that's not afraid to bend gender a bit by getting an ear pierced or wearing too tight clothes, you are still masculine. This would also be a great scent if you are a lesbian who wears short hair, but can also rock some edgy lipstick. :)\n\n* When would you wear this *\nNot too early in the morning, but surely at school or the office. Out to dinner? Maybe, if you don't overdo it, because it smells kinda gourmondy (edible) and that could not match with any dish. Datenight then? Yes!\n\nTo conclude:\nStay away if you hate vanilla and lavender. If you do like that; this is a safe choice for a calm confident guy (or maybe woman).", "49": "What's the hate all about? - The Name!

Probably Bvlgari Man in Black, but way more spicy!\n\nWhat's delivered instead?\nNOT spices. Sweet pipe tobacco scent.\n\nIs the Spicebomb DNA still present? \nYes, but very mildly.\n\nIs this really Spicebomb \"extreme\"? \nNope. Not by far. This is a scent in its own regard. In all honesty, V&R would've had a much better commercial success by releasing this as a totally separate release. TabacBomb, maybe?\n\nPerformance?\nLOUD!

Lavender make little masculine vibe at first, but just wait and the magic happens. It become just beauty and feminine, soft and warm, free and comforting parfym that you couldnt resist.  \nPlease note, that If you sniffing your wrist like me, all the time, somebody could think that there is something wrong with you :D So try to avoid that when there is other people around you, I know its hard, becose Libre smelling so, so good, and getting better and better after time goes by.. \nLibre is definitely my new signature, no doubt.

I could always give it away as a gift or wear it on occasion I thought. \nI opened it and smelled it and immediately loved it. This stuff is good ! I looked up the notes and was in complete love now. A lavender perfume with vanilla. ...one of my favourite category of all times. This perfume has incredible staying powder , great silage and amazing performance. It\u2019s like a memory of the past , to me it\u2019s Europe in a bottle. This is how perfumes use to perform , memories of the 80s here ,updated. Great quality , elegant , sophisticated yet sexy and warm. It has a sweet creamy vibe which is slightly herbal and aromatic , the vanilla makes it so feminine and sexy , something is slightly fresh it must be the lavender and jasmine and orange musk and ambergris that may appear ever so slightly soapy. All the notes are pretty much a combination of my favourites notes. So to me this perfume is heavenly ! \nAmbergris , musk , cedar and vanilla are the base of this creamy rich scent that manages to be light and fluffy at the same time. Masterpiece to my nose. \nLibre is described as a sexy cool , warm floral walking the line between masculine and feminine ,they say it\u2019s the hottest launch of the year , they say Libres freestyle takes on the fougere , a classic style of men\u2019s fragrances featuring lavender with the warm heart of the vanilla and ambergris and burning hot with orange blossom. ... \nThe only thing not so great about this perfume is the cheap light plastic cap. It should have more weight to it. It cheapens the perfume bottle somewhat. \nI see Sephora carries this now. So I ordered a purse spray from there. Not that it\u2019s needed as this perfume lasts and lasts into the night and next morning.", "2": "Look, it's not a bad release or anything and the fact that it's nothing groundbreaking doesn't really take away anything for me ... but it's business perfume, plain and simple. Hitting the right chords to be a big seller and not really building from that. In saying that, it does a good job at that so no complaints. \nOnce the ultra synthetic opening settles down, it becomes a lovely vanilla and orange blossom fragrance with light herbal aspects that softly waft around you. Would it be someone's signature? Sure, why not. It's a 'live, laugh, love' wall-sign type of scent, though.", "3": "Oh wow, this is an eye-opener. Libre does smell like free air, but gorgeously fragrant. \nThe head is so enchanting that I literally gasped. My overall impression is delicate floral. There is no loudness, no clich\u00e9.

It is feminine as can be. \nAnd the longevity is exceptional.", "4": "Wow. I loved this in the store... but I had no idea..\nWhen I first sprayed this on after I bought it, wasn\u2019t truly impressed, but it was pleasant enough to continue wearing.

I have no been disappointed with the growth that has occurred and persisted for the now 13 hours I\u2019ve had it on.  \nLasts forever.  \nGets richer and lovelier with time.  \nProjects well enough that people smell you when you walk by.  \nIt really did blow me away. At first, it smelled too simple and clean, but boy was I wrong.  \nI love it.  \nCould be a new sig."}, "18": {"0": "I'm with you positive folks... \nYes, it's not a Dior or a niche. Big whoop! I've avoided reviewing this one because of the review bashing going on, but for me, this is a great loud scent for hanging out with the guys. I don't wear it for the women, I wear it for myself. I wear it when I'm confident, and maybe a little cocky. I wear it when I have absolutely zero desire to impress anyone and when I don't really care what anyone thinks. I have however received quite a few compliments on it.  \nTo me, it smells better than Le Male, as that was its competition when I bought it. I couldn't stand Le Male, but I love the note separation in Eros. The vanilla and mint are very distinct and separate, yet very well balanced by the tonka. It starts out smooth and LOUD! Then it dries down spicy and intimate while retaining good projection until it's gone. Luckily, my skin eats the vanilla-mint alive, so I tend to get more of the scent of the drydown for the duration of the fragrance, but on others' skin, it tends to remain more minty.  \nMost days, I'll pick up Eros and give it a sniff, and it doesn't match my mood. But on the days that it does, it's the only scent that fits. Nothing else in my collection fits that mood, and although I don't wear Eros often, it has earned a home within my collection.  \nBottom line: Don't feel ashamed for your fragrance tastes. Cheap, expensive, doesn't matter. Wear what you like. That's the POINT of fragrances! Some of the best scents in my collection are also the cheapest, and some of my favorites are among the most \"synthetic\". \nFor the love of fragrance, happy sniffing. ;-)", "1": "Here to say that Versace Eros is not JUST for the younger clubbing crowd! It can also work for the mature man (30+) who is both confident and willing to wear an attractive, creamy, soft-sweet fragrance for men, worn in moderation. I have found this fragrance to be such a smooth, soothing, and incredibly \"self-satisfying\" everyday/casual scent when appropriately applied (as other similarly-stated reviews here \"convinced\" me a year ago). I quite enjoy the scent of Eros, but I am equally grateful for how it makes me FEEL (ie. calm, relaxed, content, with a sense of \"life is good\" throughout my day). It is actually this latter quality that makes it doubly hard NOT to reach for Eros-- Essentially I am now a 50-plus year old addict of this fragrance!  \nSo if you are 30+ and interested, definitely try before you buy with a \"light to normal\" wearing of Eros--waiting at least an hour into the dry-down to allow the minty open to fully settle-in, getting creamy smooth..... with the vanilla, tonka, apple, lemon, and woods. Don't over-apply lest you find it too sweet, cloying or having a clubbing effect. You may just be VERY pleasantly surprised with what you discover! I find Eros is best worn in the Fall, Winter, and most Spring days. I have a mid-2017 batch having near-perfect light to moderate projection with beastly longevity @ 17 hours on skin and a solid 7+ days on clothes!

It's a great fragrance and definitely a head turner. It has crazy projection and longevity. Great for a night on the town!

Love Eros ! \n10/10"}, "19": {"0": "I held off on buying this beautiful fragrance for months because every youtube video and review all parroted the obvious *fact* that it had terrible performance due to years and years of irresponsible reformulations. There are several youtube videos comparing the smell and longevity of LNDL over the course of a decade and the videos all found that they farther back the bottle was made, the darker and stronger it was and the longer it lasted. It is still treated as fact that YSL is a greedy awful company who is watering down their product over the years to sell more bottles and save money. Even though it would be terrible business to alienate your loyal customers and the costs of perfume oils and raw ingredients are marginal to the overall cost of a fragrance. Out of curiousity I looked at old reviews of LNDL that are on this website and I found the following comments: \nIt certainly lasts longer than L'Homme but still not more than about 4 hours (unless you spray lavishly but which makes it too sweet) -04/18/2009 \n3 hours of good sillage then close to the skin -09/19/2012 \nI like the base note, but it's weak as water -2/26/2013 \nSmells good, but nobody notices I am wearing it. -2/24/2013 \nSmells wonderful straight from go, gets better as it drys, doesnt last long though. -2/17/2013 \nLasts about 2-3 hours on my skin. -10/01/2014 \nIt has the basic vibe of the original though more generic and so much weaker that I wish I didn't go through my old bottles so quickly. The original scent also projected more. The sillage was better as well. So it is very safe to say that reformulations have ruined the performance of this once beastly fragrance. -09/06/2015 \nThis was never a beast mode fragrance and performance has always been fairly weak to moderate longevity. Well why do youtubers say the older bottles lasted longer? Because they do? What? Let me introduce you to a new word: Maceration - The aging of chemical compounds. All perfumes will change in smell overtime, often becoming denser as the lighter top notes like citrisus and bergamot burn off, alcohol is slowly evaporated, and basenotes combine becoming stronger. The back of all your fragrance boxes has a number (usually 36 to 48) which is the number of months until the scent starts to change significantly. \nThe Creed Aventus message boards all harp on how old bottles of aventus were darker and smokier and longer lasting and all the new ones are much brighter and weaker. The comments from 2016 all say they wish they had stocked up on the 2012 holy grail batches, the 2017 threads all wish theirs performed like the 2015 holy grail batches and the new 2020/2021 wish they had more of the 2016/2017 batches. It's all the same juice. It might be reformulated slightly to be in compliance with EU regulations but it's all essentially the same. \nThe point of this long post is I'm trying to say that the reformulation police are mostly a bunch of morons who have no idea what they are talking about. Almost every fragrance is accused of reformulation that has made it weaker and killed performance. These companies aren't stupid, these frangrances are multimillion dollar businesses and subjected to stringent quality testing and extremely precise material inspection and mixing standards. This is an incredibly beautiful fragrance, performance is just okay.", "1": "I gave Le Nuit to my father as a gift. To me, mens fragrances are usually too strong for my nose.

Love ya daddy and enjoy!", "2": "Review for Vintage (Original 2010) formulation:  \nThis is truly awesome fragrance! To me, if you can conjure imagery from a scent, then you have accomplished something unique and exceptional. Your olfactory senses allow your mind to visualize...with La Nuit de l'Homme I find myself, \"...upon a dark, cool night with a light breeze and a full moon shining bright, radiating off of clouds. I am in the woods - alone, but not afraid or cold. I am walking on a path to the one I love and I will be there soon...and, I know she is waiting for me.\" \nOkay - a little cheesy, but this is honestly how transcendent YSL's juice is to me. I first smelled this and was absolutely in love with the intoxicatingly rich and spicy cardamom - a note that I am already very fond of and I think this bottle has used it masterfully! However, as singular as the nose is at first, it warms into a heart of gorgeous lavender (fresh, not dried) that is blended harmoniously with warm citrus (bergamot), which also lifts the accord and giving it a breeze of fresh air. The cedar is not overly used or dusty - on the contrary - this is very rich and damp cedar. The olfactory pleasure continues into the dry down with a nice fresh vetiver accord that is not overly \"rooty\" or earthy. A slightly sharp, but also clean vetiver that melds with the cedar and lavender with the cardamom carrying through the whole composition. This turns, on my skin (nothing short of amazing) slightly sweet, powdery blend of warm notes that just seem to breathe on my skin! That is coumarin in the base...and it is used in perfect balance here. A word of caution...don't over-apply. But, feel free to wear a fair amount as this is not overly 'loud'.  \nI have seen people say 4 shots - one on the chest, one each pulse point on the neck and one on the back of neck. I think I would say that is about right - on a cold night (when this is perfect) maybe add one to the wrists. This is a fantastic, radiating scent. Maybe put one shot on the clothes, but this really feels fantastic (and smells right) on my skin.  \nA true night-time scent - possibly year-round with milder application on a summer night, but absolutely do-able. Stunning, dark, sexy as hell and chic! Better for formal, but possible with up-scale casual attire. This can wear you, if you are not confident and know what you want out of \"that night\". If you are in a Nascar shirt and jeans shooting pool and wear this, you have offended this fragrance and the bottle should be taken away from you at once. \nMy firm score - 9/10. Don't try to make this work for you...ask your partner as you are close with them if this is something they like. La Nuit de l'Homme is truly an intimate fragrance. I believe most will love it, but if they don't then you need to find something that does - or possibly another partner. Cheers.", "3": "la nuit de lhomme is a beast!!

Also I liked it better. \nWill test it a couple more times, but it seems like it could be bottle worthy. \nAlso I think it will shine mostly on summer nights, as it has some tropical sweetness with some cardamon in it making it seductive. But it could work year round, maybe not on hot summer days.", "10": "I've been wearing JPG Le Male flankers, and the original Le Male, since its release 25 years ago. Le Male Le Parfum smells like Le Male came full circle and reached its maturity. The Lavender note is regal, severe, sticky and sweet from start to finish, but in an addictive way, not sickening or nauseating. The cardamom and vanilla combo is magnetic and uplifting. I got random compliments from strangers, male and female. Powerful stuff, so I guess 5 sprays is the limit, even for a night out.", "11": "I always loved Ultramale but it was a little too sweet, then there's Le Male Le Parfum and I'm loving it!", "12": "On my skin spicy opening, it cuts a little bit. However after a while it settles down into nice vanilla - lavender cocktail with gentle cardamom, but sort of dark one (I wouldn't be surprised if there was a bit of coffee or tobacco). Can't pick any mint or cinnamon.\n\nThere's original Le Male DNA for sure, but Le Parfum smells to me more mature and rounded. Not so much straight into your face (no offense, I'm a big fan of original actually). Not sticky sweet as Ultra Male. It's like an older confident brother of those two, sitting in a nice suit by the fireplace after dark, waiting for the right moment to come.quite sensual. \nSort of J'ose Eisenberg vein.\n\nI wouldn't have guessed by the paper strip sample, but after testing it on my skin, I would be definitely fine wearing this myself in colder months as a woman too.\n\nTo me solid 7,5/10 and well done", "13": "A little Lolita Lempika au Masculin, a very little Fierce A&F (really!), some Le M\u00e2le Le Terrible, and the original Le M\u00e2le.\nI don't care for the opening, the opening is a little off putting but the dry down is divine.\nIt's not sweet, it's fresh and clean.\nThere is even a hint of BR 540.\nVery very pleasant flanker.\nEdit: wow, it's gorgeous.\nNow I also love the opening.\nAnd performances are excellent.\nLongevity 24h+\nI'm still able to smell it 24h later after a shower.", "14": "Sheeeeet, this stuff is magical. Smells amazing and lasts 10+ hours. Blind buy worthy.", "15": "i've worn this now for a few time in last 3 weeks. First thing that i want to notice is JPG finally released a fragrance that does perform well. My le Male of 1998 is a real beast but unfortunately aged since it is open for more then 20years now. My Le Male of 2018 suck in performance, and smells different than my old bottle. Ultra male did never perform on my skin. 2-3h max before it isn't noticeable on my skin (BPI last a little bit longer, but not like a beast). This le Male le Parfum performs really good. The scent projects for about 6h and is for 10-12h a skin scent. Le Beau, essence the parfum, eau Fraice, aviator, in the navy, and many other flankers did not perform well, this one does. \n\nThe opening is sweet but elegant, and after 1h some notes reminds me a little bit of my old le male bottle of 1998. However, it is a totally different fragrance than le male. \n\nFor me it was worth a blind buy, but if you are not a fragrance collector I would suggest to first smell it in a store before buying it.", "16": "I have this perfume in 75 milliliter size.\nTry a high intensity for the first hour and then lower to a medium intensity.\nWith a duration of about 8 hours.\nWhen I tried this perfume I realized that it has notes that we are not told anywhere, so to be able to make a better opinion of the perfume (for the review on my youtube channel). I got in touch with one of their perfumers Quentin Bisch, who very kindly told me some of the important notes in the perfume:\nIris.\nA woody flower with an animal character.\nFir resin.\nVanilla bean (not vanilla).\nThe idea of this perfume to reissue the well-known Le Male to give it another character.\nThey remove the orange blossom and add irises to give it character, maturity and elegance.\nThe fir resin combined with the vanilla pod will give the perfume a dark and powerful tiled character.\nThe lavender have wanted that in this case it does not feel clean.\nLike vanilla, instead of being so sweet, here it feels more earthy or woody because of the vanilla bean.\nWhen I put on this perfume, its salutation is dark, dense, noscturnal, indeed it is like a sweet but dark liquor, the sensation of these notes even reminded me of dark cocoa or coffee notes. When about an hour passes, you can feel the lavender trying to give this outfit some scent.\nThis perfume changes what is the DNA of Le Male, it is as if the young and crazy boy that was Le Male has matured and is transformed into a mature man who is more handsome with age.", "17": "This scent really reminds me of Prada Luna Rossa Black. Both fragrances are dark, smokey, and seductive. However, this fragrance takes it to a whole new level with the performance. Whereas with Prada Luna Rossa Black, I get about 6 hours at most, with Le Male EDP, I have gotten 9-10 hours, even receiving an unsolicited compliment 8 hours after I had initially sprayed it on. \n\nLe Male EDP is a great blind buy if you want something sexy, dark, and smokey. Perfect for cold weather and the night, although it can be surprisingly versatile too, and can be worn to the office (providing you dont spray too much). \n\nScent: 9/10\nLongevity: 9/10\nProjection: 8/10\nOverall: 9/10", "18": "If I had listen to all the negative comments I wouldn\u2019t have had this amazing new edition in my collection. In fact I\u2019m glad because that means less people will smell like this, like the original le male. Le male Le parfum is such a sexy scent with hints of le male and ultra male but has his own lane. This guy has grown up and is super Rico suave! Crisp button up shirt, while showing some chest. When I say this thing is beast mode I don\u2019t say that lightly. The projection is there, the sillage and longevity is there. I can\u2019t wait for the cooler, windy nights here in California because I will be noticed haha. Listen folks this is definitely full bottle worthy. A strong 9 out of 10 for me. It\u2019s hard to get a 10 outta me. It has to be a masterpiece for a 10.", "19": "This is probably the best men\u2019s fragrance I\u2019ve ever smelled. The opening is good but the dry down is where Le Male Le Parfum really shines. It\u2019s sweet the whole way through but it goes from an oriental/spicy to a warm vanilla that just feels so cozy. \n\nThis is definitely a fall and winter fragrance that works better at night but can definitely be used during the daytime if it\u2019s cold. Perfect date night or clubbing scent. Wouldn\u2019t recommend for the office or hot weather. \n\nI\u2019ve smelled the original Le Male a few times and it\u2019s just too sickly sweet for me. This one smells more mature, refined, and mysterious. It\u2019s one of those scents where people want to get closer to you because it\u2019s so alluring. \n\nLongevity and projection are quite good, so don\u2019t believe anyone saying otherwise. \n\nCurrently this is my favorite out of the 15+ frags that I own.", "20": "Dont listen to people saying this is for men above 35 or date night only, I wear this to school and got 2 compliments the first day", "21": "This fragrance smells reeeealllllly good. It slightly smells like the original Le Male but not much. I put off buying it because of the bottle design; but between Bleu de Chanel EDP, YSL Y EDP, and Versace Dylan Blue this smells the best. It will likely be my Fall/Winter signature.", "22": "Very addicting, chocolaty and sexy. Great performance. One of my favorite night out scents", "23": "I'm 44 years old and never liked the Le Male line. I remember trying it 20 years ago and not liking it. Then my wife 10-15 years ago bought me a bottle of the original and I ended up donating it to goodwill. If I wanted to dabble with lavender I always like the Montblanc Legend DNA better (and wife liked that one too). I tried several of the flankers at malls and never liked them. By the time Ultra Male came out I already had 2 kids and wasn't interested in a clubbing type of fragrance. But this one is a stunner. Instead of being a freshy it's a spicy vanilla warm scent. That Le Male DNA is still there in the background but for me it works 100x better as a warm spicy fragrance. My wife loves it too. Probably my favorite fall/winter fragrance of 2020.", "24": "Just pure love for me. I find this absolutely incredible and probably my favorite JPG as im not really a huge fan of JPGs, but this is just one of the most gorgeous colder weather fall scents going imo.", "25": "Hands down the best fall/winter designer release of 2020 in my opinion. I was never a fan of the original Le Male as I couldn't stand the prominent mint note but this latest flanker knocks it out of the park. Not too sweet, not too dark, simply exactly right for colder days. It has this light smokey quality, combined with uplifting iris and lavender and a hint of vanilla. Just brilliant. Projects well and has good longevity as well.", "26": "I've never smelled anything as good as this. I sprayed this on my hand at Macy's many moons ago. It was heavenly, I washed my hands multiple times and yet the scent still lingered on. This scent starts off spicy with a tad of iris, then in the dry down it is all about lavender and vanilla. The beginning by itself is a 10/10, I could smell it all day. The dry down is an 11/10.", "27": "I liked the original Le Male back in the '90's. Didn't bother for it though since the reformulation. Le Male was more for 30- anyway. But then I got a sample of Le Male Le Parfum and I liked it. I actually liked it a lot. My girlfriend liked it. A lot. So I bought a 125ml. And I still like it. It has pretty good longevity on me. Sillage is not overly powerfull to my nose, but people around me tell me they can smell it from a small distance. But in a nice way. To me, the scent is spicy, cosy, warm. It has a bit of a sweet, creamy, oriental gourmand kind of vibe. I even ordered a back up bottle.", "28": "Best perfume ever, is already my signature.\nMost projecting of Le Male line, one spray fills a room.\nA perfect all season all occasions head-turner.\nIconic packaging. Black and gold: elegance and luxury.\n\nWarm, sensual, enveloping sweet cardamom opens the symphony;\nClean hearth with iris and a gorgeous nice quality lavander makes you addicted;\nExotic oriental and woody base notes make the scent FANTASTIC.\nJust wow.\n\nReminds me of Venezia by Laura Biagiotti (my mum\u2019s signature for over 30 years) because of his oriental-woody sweetness.\nTrust me, Le Male Le Parfum will make you want to lick the bottle and have sex with yourself on the table in front of million people.\nLove for everybody, bye.", "29": "This is some magical juice. I blind bought it last year and at first thought not for me, but after giving it a few wears, this was my biggest cold weather compliment getter. The things my wife said when I wore this... I'll leave it to your imagination.", "30": "Holy crap, LMLP is currently sitting at a 4.52\nI think it's safe to say it's reached S tier status.\nI remember getting it when it was first released and it was scored at about 4.45.\nNow it's surpassed The One EDP. Pretty impressive", "31": "Mix Le Male and a little bit of Ultra Male, this is the outcome. 9/10 from me.", "32": "A balanced mix of sweet vanilla, powdery iris and aromatic, almost soapy, lavender with a touch of cardamom sparkling off the skin. Moderate-strong initial projection dies down to a small bubble over 2-3hr, longevity 8-10hr.\n\nNot my favorite of the modern male designer vanilla fragrances, but it is unique enough to be up to an individual's tastes. You've got the powdery, more pure vanilla Code Absolu, the darker and slightly spicy amber Luna Rossa Black, the most spicy and excellent performing Spicebomb Extreme... this is the more aromatic cousin of all these. Maybe even Code EDP, which this is most similar to, or budget niche options in Divine Vanille + Eau des Baux. Honestly, just pick your flavor.", "33": "Oh my, this is going to be abrasive \ud83e\udd2d \n\nI can't understand how people think something with such a sweetened cardamom and vanilla is inherently masculine. I totally think the masses have been hooked by marketing, this easily smells completely unisex, and even for more feminine-leaning than so many other \"for men and women\" scents out there. My husband foisted this sample on me because it rose above his preferences for sweetness. So to read on and on here about how \"manly\" this is actually confuses me entirely, it's got some performance for sure, but it's rounded, soft, warmly spiced and very vanillic. The only classically masculine here is lavender, which is subdued very much so by the other notes. \n\nWhat is important to note (as I repeat myself for the 30,849th time) is that it doesn't *matter* and people should wear what they *like*. If guys are wearing this and feel attractive, or if women are attracted to it, more power to everyone. I just need to call them as I see them (or rather, smell them). \n\nHeck, I feel a little hot too in it \ud83d\ude18 \n\nAlso what is important to note, is that this is developing gorgeously on my skin, and I LOVE it. The combo of vanilla and a bit of lavender is reminiscent of Mon Guerlain, but the cardamom is gloriously soft and plush. I smell nutmeg as well. \n\nIt really has some \"lift\" to it and projects quite well. It's buttery and smooth (yes, really, I think fragrances have texture), and it's fun.\u00a0 \n\nI would definitely rock this.", "34": "Got a 4.2 ounce for around $67 dollars so I figured why not and I\u2019m so glad I bought it. It\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s all I can say. If ultra male was too sweet for your taste (like myself) and you want something more well rounded and luxurious go for this. It\u2019s a easy wear and I\u2019m definitely making this my signature for the winter.", "35": "Very addictive, sexy fragrance. Sweet, gourmand and masculine. Has a little bit of the Le Male/Ultra Male DNA + Bad Boy (dry-down) + La Nuit in it. Possibly my favourite JPG yet. Not sure about projection, but definitely long-lasting for me. It's similar to a lot of other fragrances in this category, so it's not unique or terribly interesting, but still smells amazing! Can be worn all year round except on warm summer days, but could be good for cooler summer evenings. 9/10", "36": "For everyone saying it is too sweet - what did anyone expect with a note breakdown that includes iris, lavender and vanilla. Plus it's a parfum version so it'll be darker, sweeter and overall more intense. It's lovely for what is wants to be and more refined - the current le male formulation is a bit headach-y in how it wants to balance freshness with sweetness to retain versatility. The Le Parfum doesn't try to do this double act, focusing on being a more committed cool weather cozy warm scent. And no - it isn't like Ultra Male - there's not just fruitiness, the sweetness is rich and creamy. Please don't buy this thinking it is the original le male - the notes should tell you that. This is just a great cool weather scent - more like the dessert course in a perfume meal that serves Bvlgari Man in Black or Dior Homme Intense....", "37": "As samples go, Le Male Le Parfum has risen to the top of the list for me.  Affordable, non-offensive, and sweet smelling to my nose.\n\nI can understand where the \"lady killer\" reputation for this fragrance came from.  I could see myself wearing this fragrance year round, for any occasion.\n\nEDIT 12/7: HOLY SHIT.  I wore this last night to an event and I felt SEXY.  Le Male Le Parfum is going to be my next full bottle of fragrance.", "38": "My Top5 and my personal favourite for intimate night out\nRich, deep, intimate, sexy, not too sweet and too brutal like Ultra Male, but its SUPER LONG LASTING, can easily stay 12-14 Hours on my skin\nEven its my personal favourite for intimate night out, but honestly Rasasi Daarej and D&G the one EDP still got lot more compliment from girls when i used it", "39": "Yes. Just yes. If you are thinking of buying it then just do it.\n\nI love Le Male, and JPG perfected this one. The cardamom is so dominant on this one which makes it very inviting and appealing. The dry down is dominated by lavender and vanilla.\n\nJP continues to run such an underrated fragrance line, this might just be my favourite from JPG.", "40": "This scent portrays a gentleman who knows that he is sexy yet humble about it at the same time. An intimate, soft scent that still grabs your attention because of the sweetness. This one gets the job done. \n\nThe longevity and projection is not nuclear like Ultra Male but the performance is still very good for me. \n\nI reserve Le Male Le Parfum for occasions like date nights in the cooler weather. Actually wearing this right now, and about to pick up my date in an hour or so to go to our Valentine\u2019s dinner. Felt I should share my thoughts first. \n\n9/10", "41": "Sounds like this is catching some shade here.\n\nThis is an AMAZING scent!!  I think that there are similarities to the original le Male but barely.  Just enough to say they may be related.  I love the richness, the vanilla, the warmth.  This could easily be my signature scent... if I didn't live in a desert where 112 degrees is pretty common (but have still worn in that heat and received compliments).\n\nWhen I first received it, I sprayed it in my off on some paper.  Didn't think much of it but 3 people came in during the next hour and wanted to know what the awesome smell was.  This stuff is fire!  I love the Ultra Male too but this is not that.  They did a great job with it that it's not the original and not Ultra Male but has some qualities of both.  \n\nLove this stuff!!\nBTW, I think they did a similar thing with Armani Code Parfum... which I love as well!", "42": "This thing is awesome. Definitely don\u2019t go crazy on the trigger tho. Women absolutely love this scent.", "43": "such a great fragrance, I see it as the Modern Le Male.

Lasts all day.", "44": "I\u2019ve smelled this one on a customer and asked for the name of his fragrance and went then to buy it immediately the next day. My first one was a 75ml and when that nearly went empty i bought a 200ml but something was different it smelled so weird and different so I just stopped wearing it. \n\nAfter 2 months or more of not using a single spray I didn\u2019t know what to wear to work today so I just tried this again, I wanted to give it another try and god damn am I glad i did. \n\nI don\u2019t love the opening but I also don\u2019t hate it, it\u2019s too spicy for me to a certain degree. \nToday was the first time I\u2019ve experienced a fragrance developing from the top notes to the middle and then base notes(I just began recently to collect and try many different fragrances so that was very special to me.).\nAfter 2 hours or so the spiciness disappeared and seamlessly transitioned into the Iris. The Iris is so amazing and smooth I thought that my Dior Homme Parfum is what I\u2019m starting to smell from the day before, but then I remembered that\u2019s a new shirt so it can\u2019t be and then it came to my mind that this one uses Iris.\n\nAfter another 2 hours the Iris merged with the Vanilla and holy shit was that amazing. \nThe Iris mixed with the Vanilla was sooooo creamy and smooth. \nI was able to smell Le Male Le Parfum for about 6 hours on me which is really really rare since I go anosmic to fragrances pretty fast. So i can never tell how long they last. \nThis was an amazing journey where I became familiar with the transition of Top -Middle and -Basenotes for the first time.", "45": "When my decant of this finally arrived and I was able to apply it, I immediately hopped online to buy the biggest bottle I could.  This \"wow'd\" me.  I haven't been wow'd in a while after obtaining 140+ fragrances.\n\nHere's a short story confirming how good this smells.  \n\nSo I received my package in the mail early in the morning.  After applying about 4 spray, one on each arm, one on the front of my neck and one on the back of my neck, I had to go to the grocery store.  Within 3 minutes inside the store, a woman stopped me and said \"I'm sorry, but you smell really amazing.\" I continued to tell her what it was (saying this whole fragrance name is kind of a mouth full lol).  I'm one who doesn't get a whole bunch of compliments like some of you say you do.  I don't work in an office.  I don't go around asking people if I smell nice.  But this one got me a compliment in the first 20 minutes of wearing it.  \n\nIn short, this fragrance is really good.  This is a resounding Big Bottle Blind Buy approved!!!", "46": "received a 1.5ml tester in the post. Its a warm vanilla oriental, doesnt have great depth and its not exactly mind blowing.

Is something truly generic? Or is it just a phrase too over used in fragcom? \nLayton is in my opinion a brand new take into a masculine sweet fragrance. A borderline gourmand but with a fresh bite. A rich apple note with warm cinnamon with vanilla that\u2019s aggressive, yet inviting. The opening does come off a bit like other openings of designer realms such as bergamot based openings but the scent is far from over. 15 minutes after you\u2019ll start to detect the warm cinnamon and creamy sandalwood.

This is an amazing scent.  \nThe snobs will tell you this is generic and not even niche. But ask yourself this, when have you ever smelled something like Layton out there? There are other offerings from the house that indeed smell similar to designer fragrances. You can say Eros, ultra male, boss bottled, but none of those even come close to this creation.

It turned up in the mail 3 days ago. From the first spray I was totally in awe of this fragrance. It is something really special. I\u2019m not gonna bother discussing the actual notes etc.. it\u2019s all been said here already.\n\nBit of background Before I go on.. In my line of work I\u2019m half office/half site based. Climate where I live is sub tropics and we\u2019re coming into summer. It gets hot and humid.\n\nToday was the first day I actually put it on in the morning before work and put 2 sprays on either arm and one on the neck/shirt collar area.\n\nToday was 27 degrees C and humidity around 88%. Yes, I ignored the reviews stating this wasn\u2019t a scent for high temps/heat. Off I went In my air conditioned work vehicle to the Air conditioned office really pleased with the beautiful scent that was lingering around me. It wasn\u2019t over the top strong/loud by any means..\n\nAfter a couple of hours in the office I had to go out and do a site inspection so jumped in the work vehicle and off I went. once I got to site i got out of the vehicle and undertook my inspection which took half an hour walking around in the heat. Got back in the vehicle and drove back to the office. Half way back to the office I turned the aircon in the vehicle off cause it was getting cold and then once I parked I had to walk a few hundred metres to my  office buidling entrance basically in the hottest part of the day.. \n\nLet me just say WOW... I can\u2019t believe what the heat did to the three decent sprays of this juice that I put on 4 hours before.. It went from being something that I could sense was lingering around me to something that I could taste in the back of my throat and was LOUD..\n\nSeriously it just exploded off me.. I sat down at my desk and about 5 minutes later one of my work colleagues (who was there in the morning before I left to go out to site) who sits about 5 metres from me on the other side of a partitioned desk stood up and said \u201cwhat is that unbelievable smell in the air\u201d.. \n\nAlthough I\u2019m pretty certain she didn\u2019t find it offensive, after all the beautiful smell was still a beautiful smell just bloody well stronger, I was shocked that something I\u2019d sprayed on at around 6am in the morning and hadn\u2019t really seemed very strong had morphed into this after adding the heat of the day and heat from my body from walking in a humid heat at around 11am. Does this happen to others here?, is this normal?\n\nLesson learned I guess.. and at the time I was more than a little worried that I\u2019d subject those around me to something overpowering and potentially offend them.\n\nI got home from work around 4pm and it had faded back down to being much less obtrusive but I was still getting some nice wafts of it (mainly off the collar of my work shirt that I was still wearing) nearly 10 hours after application..\n\nThis juice is an absolute powerhouse on my skin and I as stated I absolutely love the smell of it but I just don\u2019t know how I can wear it again.. even in winter here where I live it doesn\u2019t get cold.. most winters days are 25 degrees C, sun out cloud free..\n\nEdit:\n\nI wore Layton again on Friday and only went two sprays.. it\u2019s was a milder day and whilst I could definitely sense a cloud around me it never got out of hand anywhere near what it did the day before.\n\nSo.. I pulled the trigger on a full bottle.. dear as poison but worth it. I figure I\u2019ve got plenty of other good juices to wear on hot days so I\u2019ll use the Layton selectively according to weather forecasts and whether or not I know if I\u2019m going to be in or out of the office etc that day..\n\nIt\u2019s far too great a scent to not try and make it work!..", "9": "Layton is the only fragrance in my sizable collection that makes me physically aroused..", "10": "2 sprays lasts for hours and strong as steel, I can't see why someone will need a stronger version, It is a very lovely charming masculine/gentleman scent; That changes and becomes greater after an hour. I recommend do not over apply ; For it will repel someone in the next room ;If done so, 2 sprays last an estimated 12 hours on skin and 4 days on clothing.\nScent 10/10\nSilage 10/10\nLong lasting 10/10\nThanks,", "11": "Dear Fragrantica Friends, \n\nPdM Layton is a sweet apple mixed with super addictive spices. A beautiful juice indeed. I went through 2 bottles and recently bought a third. Unfortunately, the new batches (2020) are extremely bad. Performance is awful - I mean 6-hour longevity as a skin scent but only 1 hour of consistent projection (maybe around 2 or 3 on clothes). Unacceptable for a 220 Euros fragrance. I went to the store and returned my bottle.\nIt seems Parfums de Marly is going the Creed route. A shame.", "12": "It has the apple from Boss Bottled EDP, vanilla from Chanel Allure Homme, cardamon from YSL La Nuit de L'homme and sweetness of Ferragamo's Uomo. Make no mistake this stuff is better than all of those fragrances I listed. Mainstream appeal with niche quality, well blended and worth every penny. Atomic projection and sillage, to my nose this is the King of fresh spicy scents.", "13": "Patchouli, patchouli, patchouli! Why does no one mention the patchouli in this?! So far I'm getting more patchouli than cardamom, but I love the way the peppery notes offset the fruitiness of this scent. The black pepper/cardamom blend really well into the patchouli to create one very well unified texture. \n\nSo far, this reminds me of the creamy, tangy, fruity notes in Pure Malt, the vanilla-apple notes in Versace Eros and Boss Bottled, and the salty patchouli and pepper in Sauvage, but this smells higher quality than all of them. This makes for quite the well rounded scent! \n\nNot to mention, it lasts and projects VERY well! I could easily see this being someone's favorite or someone's signature! I'd really like to own a full bottle some day.", "14": "Smells like a higher quality boss bottled meets pure malt/zest, but fresher and a little less sickly sweet, but still very sweet overall. Easily signature scent worthy, all around banger. Day, night, every season except for hot summer. This is a winner! This is also beast mode longevity. Wore it last night and the next morning its still strong. BTW for the ultra male comparisons, this is so much classier and versatile than ultra. I see the comparison because both give off a cotton candy sweet vibe, but this is so more usable.", "15": "I have to buy a full bottle of this just for myself. This is literally one of the best fragrances I've ever smelled and idc if its masculine I am going to rock this as my signature scent.", "16": "I\u2019m surprised this scent is so polarizing in the reviews! Layton smells damn good, plain and simple. A fresh, clean, satisfying scent that definitely has a designer-type undercurrent, but I don't think that\u2019s a strike against the scent itself.\n\nThe opening is fizzy and bright \u2013 ethereal tinkling on a piano\u2019s highest keys. Sweet, but not overly saccharine. The effervescent sparkle morphs into a pretty floral heart that spins you around a few times until you get the champagne giggles. It dries down to a creamy, wood-tinged vanilla.\n\nI think many of us (myself included) tend to have preconceived notions about what a niche fragrance is *supposed* to smell like. Anything that smells too good, too perfect, too well-blended, too refined, too synthetic, too whatever is immediately demoted to unartistic rubbish. A niche that smells designer-ish is a sell out. \n\nI have seen (and been guilty of) this same mentality working in the music industry. \u201cIt sounds too slick.\u201d \u201cToo much production.\u201d \u201cThis was clearly created with a decent budget and good equipment \u2013 so basic.\u201d But listen, a great pop song is a great pop song, whether it was recorded on a battered 4-track by an indie artist or in a fancy studio by a mainstream musician. Layton has epic riffs, a killer hook, and a smooth composition \u2013 basically, it\u2019s a great pop song.\n\nLayton is a jam. Layton is MY jam. So yes, you might hear Layton on a Top 40 pop radio station alongside the mainstream bands you hate. But you know you\u2019ll be humming that damn chorus and chair-dancing like a mofo until the last note.", "17": "This is a rich, gorgeous scent. The opening in particular is mesmerizing for me. One of my favorites from the house along with Herod and Carlisle. I don't agree with the comparisons to JPG or Boss Bottled, to me it is unique even though it does have a designer-ish vibe in the sense that it is in the \"crowd-pleasing\" realm. \n\n\nSome niche-snobs will not like this one for the simple fact that is not a daring scent, but nonetheless for the average person this is a gorgeous, bright scent that is also high-quality. \n\n10/10 for me.", "18": "I have just recently acquired this fragrance and I can say with confidence this is one of the best cold weather fragrances out there (whether that be in the winter, fall, or even spring).  On my first day of wearing this through my campus I had three girls that were walking behind me catch up just to tell me they loved the smell so not only is this a compliment getter but also a conversation starter!  \nIn terms of the scent it opens with a sophisticated smelling combination of a minty cinnamon-apple, lavender, and a tinge of an orange zest. You may find this a bit off putting for the first couple minutes but once it settles down it is really excellent.  However, my favorite stage of this complex fragrance is after a couple hours where you will get this gorgeous vanilla and cardamom dry down that makes for such a cozy inviting scent\u2014perfect for cuddling up after date night.  The performance as I\u2019m sure you all have heard is excellent; all day longevity with what, in my opinion, is a perfect projection bubble(Just a little bit longer than arms length).\nThis isn\u2019t a must have for everyone because of the price point especially since a lot of the complexity is mostly enjoyed by the user but if you have a little extra money laying around I would 100% recommend this if you\u2019re looking for one of the best cold weather fragrances the world has to offer.", "19": "Like the reviewer below me stated, the best niche release of 2016 imo. Now, it has a designer appeal with a niche quality. To me it has similarities of chanel Allure PH, Bleu De Chanel, even a little African Leather due to the Geranium.  Remarkable fragrance! Lasting power is 10-12 hrs on skin and days on clothes.  I'm glad it's under the radar and not so hyped. I guess it's not daring enough? Good, you can stick to your challenging Oud and civet shit  (literally), and I'll stick to smelling pleasant.", "20": "I felt compelled to write this because the fragrance community has a real problem with elitism. Granted this is not a cheap hobby but it seems to me that people here love to find a reason to say that *their* bottle is better or that older batches *used* to be better than what we have now. \n\nNow I own a pre 2020 decant of Layton and I own a 2022 bottle so here will be the side by side review of the two bottles. \n\n2020: This has a strong green apple in the opening that lingers for 10 - 20 minutes. It lends a fresh edge to what is otherwise a very dark and spicy fragrance. While the green apple never fully goes away it does mellow out quite a bit and lends a fresh background haze to the vanilla and spices. This fresh note keeps the fragrance from ever becoming cloying even though it leans so strongly into the sweetness and spices at its heart. \n\nIt takes the richness and well blendedness if a niche scent and applies to it designer cues. It has a resemblance to Boss Bottles and Eros but whereas the other two are loud and screechy, Layton is gentle and soft. Designer fragrances with these notes would be a punch to the face, Layton is a gentle touch. You simply can't ignore it, but it does scream out its presence either. \n\nLongevity and projection are out of this world. I can smell this for 12 hours and it projects for 7 to 8 of those in an air conditioned room. In warm conditions this scent simply does not quit so I wont even bother with telling you how long it lasts. In heat it becomes a room filler.\n\n2022: This has a strong green apple in the opening that lingers for 10 - 20 minutes. It lends a fresh edge to what is otherwise a very dark and spicy fragrance.

These two bottles are near identical and any differences can probably be chalked up to 2020 batches having more time to macerate vs their 2022 counterparts. If you're finding that there is a difference between the two I would encourage you to do a blind test. I sincerely doubt you'll find any meaningful differences. \n\nLayton is still a very safe buy in 2022. I might even go so far as to say its blind buy worthy but it is quite expensive so get a sample first.", "21": "Layton is a fragrance that I\u2019ll always have in my collection. It is amongst the most complimented in my growing collection of approximately 100 colognes - people LOVE it. Smells like warm apple pie and is super long lasting. Bravo, Parfums de Marly!", "22": "At first I just liked Layton. Possibly jaded by others opinions and finding some merit in them, at first. This is one you have to wear multiple times to see that it is way better than good, its VERY good. Easily signature worthy for those that don't care for loads of variety. Within Layton itself you essentially get two distinct fragrances. The juicy and freshly washed, still dripping wet, apple is mouthwatering. The base comes off as a delicious cardamom infused caramel accord that warms the fresh vibe that the fragrance opens with. Each is composed beautifully with a transition that is smooth and showcases this fragrance is not in the designer category unless it now includes all mass appealing scents. Youthful, playful and eventually sensual.", "23": "The hype is real, it's amazing! \n\nNot much to add\n\n10/10\n\nPerfection!\n\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\nJohn:3:16", "24": "Spicey yet fresh!  Really enjoy this one.  For me, it\u2019s a cardamom explosion mixed with the sweetness of the apple.  I get the patchouli playing around in the background.  Do not get much vanilla anywhere with this DNA...but that is OK, because it\u2019s fantastic how it is.\n\nI can see why this gets so much love.  Besides being a great fragrance, it is the closest niche fragrance to a designer.  Saying that, it is well worth the money.  It\u2019s got the entire package...DNA, longevity, and performance.", "25": "It's hard to dislike this offering from Parfums de Marly.  Layton is a spicy sandalwood fragrance, with accents of green apples, and a sweet, caramel-like vanilla. The sandalwood is made spicy through the addition of an aromatic, herbal lavender note. It's sweetened with green apples, and this is how the fragrance begins. While it's woody-spicy, the notes are of the fresher variety so it's something that works well in warm weather as well as cold. As it transitions light floral qualities emerge, but they're not very strong. The dominant florals to my nose are jasmine, which begins to pair with vanilla, and geranium which keeps it along a \"fresh spicy\" plane, continuing the theme that began with the lavender. Layton warms up in the base, the robust sandalwood remaining, blended with vanilla and to my nose, some caramel. Although Layton is not a gourmand, it has gourmand qualities--mainly the green apples and their transition to vanilla/caramel kind of remind me of caramel apple Halloween treats or some kind of apple pie a la mode. I guess this could be classified as a spicy fresh woody gourmand. Versatile year round, and with enough charm to be dressed up or down, Layton is definitely in my top releases of 2016, maybe even number one. It never takes itself too seriously and it's a ton of fun to wear, I recommend it as a blind buy if you don't own any other PdM fragrances. If you already own Habdan or Oajan, you may want to sample Layton first as certain aspects of it overlap with the other two, and for some may seem redundant. Performance is good on all fronts. Thumbs up for this excellent release from Parfums de Marly.", "26": "Wonderful fragrance. The opening is powerful with the apple, bergamot and spices. The dry-down is equally awesome with vanilla, Tonka, and spices still siting in the background.\n\nThis is my second purchase from PdM. Galloway and now Layton. I plan on picking up Pegasus at the end of summer. I'm a newb at the 'fragrance game', but I really enjoy PdM's offerings when it comes to niche fragrances. Perhaps my nose isn't quite ready yet for more challenging scents (although I do like the new Gucci Guilty Absolute, which I consider a challenging scent).  :)", "27": "Intro: Its my first, this house.  \n\nLongevity: Considering the Middle Eastern temperatures, environment, human variations, this does last all through the day with a couple spritz. \n\nSillage: The sillage is pretty good and its trail lasts for about 20-30 seconds at best. \n\nOn Skin: Opens with a sweet note, mostly a ripe apple with a hint of lemon and geranium, then turns into a woody, vanilla, cardamom, lavender bouquet. Settles down to a complex sweet powdery lingering scent.\n\nVerdict: This perfume is sheer class. It is loud and not loud at the same time. Safe for office. This can be worn for any occasion, goes quite easy on sensitive noses as well.", "28": "I already own Herod and Pegasus by PdM. I tested 5ml of Layton and I was shocked from the first moment because because somehow it reminds me of La Nuit de L'homme and CH Men Prive with a PdM touch. It is a freaking nice Fragrance. The longevity is not so strong like Pegasus or Herod but it still last for 6-7 hours on my skin which is pretty good. For me the best release 2016 niche fragrance.", "29": "Wonderfully blended. You can really smell the quality in this at the first spray. An extremely smooth vanilla is the main player here (to my nose). Green apple and a hint of black pepper with the vanilla in the opening, then it evolves to this creamy vanilla/sandalwood/lavender/cardamom mix which is amazing. \nVery versitale tho I can't see myself using this during summer/hot days. It is office safe but don't overspray it.\nI get about 6-7h projection and then it turns to a skin scent which i can smell for about 10h.\nCan be used for any age and occasion.

This is NOT a generic fragrance. This is a unique, one-of-a-kind fragrance that gets us men compliments. And if getting ladies compliments = generic, then i'll choose generic over niche any day! Layton is a special spicy and aromatic fragrance that will draw peoples attentions! I'm not going to describe the notes breakdown as you can see from the chart nor will I compliment on how long it last because everyone else already has. I'm just going to say that men and women will love this fragrance. This fragrance actually gives me more compliments than most of the generic brands! Layton is still pretty new and is only really known within the fragrance community. Get this fragrance now before it turns into another hyped-up, FOMO (fear of missing out) Creed Aventus!!...

It's the one that invokes the most happiness.\n\nFor me, that is Parfums de Marly Layton. For one it smells absolutely fantastic, but what draws me to it the most is this strange but alluring menthol/Vix Vapor Rub smell it has. This subtle scent reminds me of when I was young and had asthma really bad for years. I remember always having Vix on my chest and under my nose, and through association a lot of good times were had while I smelled it. Movie nights and snacks with the family wearing nothing but a huge shirt as pajamas, Halloween nights where there is sweetness in the air, being able to have a calm and peaceful night's sleep with free'd up airways etc.\n\nAnd finally Layton has an enchanting feeling about it. . .Reminds me of a Grimm's Fairy tale where the air would smell sweet and alluring like forbidden apple trees at Snow White's cottage.\nIt just makes me happy when I smell it throughout the day and relaxes me. . .Makes me nostalgic and fantastical.\n\nI ended up selling a lot of my collection after buying this one and Tom Ford's Oud Wood.

There's no question about it, Layton is super popular and it makes the \"top 10\" list for so many reviewers. \n\nTo be perfectly honest though, when I got the sample, I really wasn't impressed by it at all. I smelled nothing that I would describe as being \"apple\" by any means. What it had, however, was something I didn't find particularly pleasant. \nIf you've ever vaped, then you might know the flavour \"Koolada\". It's not so much a flavour (because it doesn't taste like anything), but it gives you this really cold feeling in the back of your throat. It's popular in tropic cocktail type of vaping juices as it's intended to sorta simulate the feeling of having ice in a drink. \nAnyways, when you smell it, it gives you that cold sensation in your nose too. Layton had a bit of that, and then also felt like it had a waft of licorice with it. Those were the 2 main things I could smell, and it really didn't feel good at all. So I didn't pay any more attention to Layton.\n\nSo, fast-forward to 11 months later and I've gotten to that stage where I'm rounding out my collection and have a wide enough variety which keeps me interested in it. I've got PdM Herod as my \"special\" winter-time fragrance, but I had no \"special\" fragrance that would work well for the slightly warmer temps. \nLayton kept popping up everywhere and I though \"meh, maybe I should give it another go\". I've experienced a number of fragrances now that I didn't particularly like at first, but after a while became one of my favourites. I found Layton on Amazon for a really good price (full bottle) and decided to give it a go. I've ordered other fragrances from Amazon, and if I didn't like it I just returned them, so I figured I was safe doing that with this bottle of Layton too. \n\nSo, it came, I sprayed it on, and I got that Koolada licorice sensation. \"Oh, great, back it goes\"..or so I thought.\nI wore it a bit longer, used it a bit more, and the more I did the more I started to like it. I still won't call that main note \"apple\". Actually, the licorice smell is something I pick up on very prominently in apple flavour shisha (hooka), but it really does not remind me of an actual apple. After about an hour or so it develops into a nice vanilla-fruitish kind of vibe, and the final drydown goes to a soft vanilla. \nI've now had Layton for about a week and I do have to admit that I really do like it now. The other thing I simply cannot deny is just what a compliment beast it is. No lies, every single time I've worn it in public I've got at least one compliment. Unsolicited, mind you. \n\nSo, if you too have tried Layton and have not liked it at first, give it a little longer time and you might also grow to like it.\n\n\nUPDATE #1 : this is not the first time I've experienced this, but it's still amazing just how drastically your perception of a fragrance can change. I'm now no longer smelling that Koolada licorice thing, but it's straight up apple and vanilla now with it drying down to a soft vanilla as before. I've said it before in some of my other reviews and I'll say it again, it's really important not to judge a fragrance based on your initial impressions. How it smells to you and how it makes you feel can change so much over time.", "40": "I\u2019ve been exploring the Parfums de Marly house over the last couple months.  I absolutely LOVE this house.  Layton is a very nice high quality scent, but it doesn\u2019t wow me quite like Carlisle or Herod. \n\nThe opening is familiar but doesn\u2019t smell quite like any one scent that I\u2019ve come across.  I do detect some elements of Pure Malt, but it doesn\u2019t smell like Pure Malt.  There is a fruity (mostly apple), lavender, bubblegumy sweetness that has a Le Male vibe to it, although it certainly isn\u2019t a clone of that either.  Layton also has PDM\u2019s distinctive scent fingerprint lingering in the background. \n\nI like the dry down better than the opening.  The wood and sandalwood become more prominent, the sweetness tones down slightly, and the lavender gives a crisp freshness to Layton. It has awesome longevity, and lasts over 12 hours. \n\nMy PDM fragrance ranking:\n\n1a.  Carlisle \n1b.  Herod\n3.    Layton \n4.    Habdan\n5.    Oajan \n6.    Godolphin\n\nI ranked  Layton 3rd.  I can understand some ranking it 1st, or some ranking it 6th because PDM makes so many truly stunning scents.  Overall I give Layton 9/10. \n\nUpdate:  The first couple wearings I wasn\u2019t that impressed.  After about 5-6 time wearing it I really started to love Layton.

Soon after, the fragrance feels like it warms up, the menthol note fades away, and vanilla comes into play, blending together with the apple and cardamon. It creates this spicy apple pie feel. The dry down is years better than the opening, it becomes more smooth and woodsy the longer you wear it. Is this worth the hype?

Classy. Not outdated. Mature, but not too mature. Sexy. My wife loves it.", "46": "Apple, vanilla, citrus and lavender? SIGN ME UP! I always get a warm, calming vibe from this fragrance because of the vanilla although it's not really heavy and that's why it's very wearable in Spring.\n\nI don't get the criticism of it being too \"designer-esque\". Okay so maybe you're paying more than usual but the scent and performance of Layton makes it absolutely worth it. When you put this on, you don't need any validation from people around you. You will smell good.\n\nThis gets a perfect rating for me. Backup bottle worthy. If I can only have 3 fragrances, Layton makes the cut easily.", "47": "Yes. Hype is true on this one. Fantastic in every way. Performance is great. Lovely note mixture. Just an excellent perfume.", "48": "Possibly the most addictive fragrance in my collection. Sweet but at the same time \"airy\" without being cloying with its sweetness, a very seductive aroma that exudes luxury. Oriental, sensual and definitely unique, despite being associated with some designer perfumes.\nI didn't fell in love with Layton with the very first spray tho, got some \"One Million\" vibes, a fresh bubblegummy feel which didn't blow my mind. Give Layton some minutes...or some sprays/wearings more. There are a lot more things also going on, it is not just a simple \"refined Boss Bottled Intense\" fragrance.\n\n\nScent: 9.5-10/10 \nSmellwise i do feel it is one of the most stunning scents I have ever smelled, but this is of course a matter of personal taste! You will hardly dislike or hate it tho. Vanilla, apple, cardamon, levander and some mild woods blended masterfully, creating a delightful harmony to the nose.\n\nPerformance: 8/10 \nVery good, it is a scent that lingers in the air a lot and stays on clothes. Noticeable enough but not huge projection. \n\nVersatility: 9/10 \nWearable almost all year around, except from the hot summer days. Suitable for every formal event, almost every casual, office friendly with soft use. I do not also see someone wearing Layton while going on sports or dressed sporty.\n\nOverall:\nTaking everything into consideration, Layton is a SOLID 9/10 in the fragrance stage, for me is a 9.5/10. Even blind buy worthy, as I did, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend ($$$...) \n\n\nPS!\nAny other with a seemingly very new bottle with LOT 0130038? It's a 7-digit batch code instead of the classic 6-digit and the batch number is printed on the bottle, not in the sticker on the bottom of the bottle. Has the manufacturer maybe made some minor changes?\n(bought from a -considered- trustful and legit discounter)", "49": "One of the smoothest, well-blended spicy vanilla fragrances of all time.

I was, when he was still art dirctor at YSL where he launched the amazing M7 frag for men and created the beautiful bottle. In 2005 he left and created his own brand (what else of a self proclaimed egomaniac) called: 'Tom Ford'. Cashing in on his supposed 'sex symbol' status for the ladies, he posed sedutively on a cover of Vanity Fair, where he sat clothed between an totally naked Scarlett Johansen and Keira Knightly. Although he is 100% and now openly gay. Sorry ladies. \nThat misleading of people, I don't like with TF. I also don't like the excruciatingly overrated and overpriced 'Private Blends' by the man and his bigger than big ego. Those private blends are medicore frags dressed up in ridiculous expensive prices, so that when you bought one, you have to find it great or you would die of embarassement that you let yourself be fooled byt the TF marketing bulldozer. But I must confess, I find some of the first frags of his own house like 'Black Orchid' (2006) an unabasehdly and shmeless masterpiece on the same level as 'Opium', 'Chanel Coco' the first 'Lolita Lempicka'... I think he is a blown up poser who is capable of making the occasional great frag. 'Genius' I guess. And 'Black Orchid' is fabulous and gorgeous, make no mistake. As is the bottle. Praise where rightfully praise is due. \nHow does 'Black Orhcid' tick and smell? It is a complex frag in the 'old school' style of the 'classics' mentioned here. Not 'Less is more', like the minimalist Bernard Ellena's for Herm\u00e8s like 'Jardin apr\u00e8s le Mousson', 'Toit', 'Nil'... but 'More is more'! Black Orchid is also like the Guerlains, the Diors... an intricate work with a symphony of notes. Top: jasmine, gardenia, ylang-ylang, bergamot, lemon, mandarin, blackcurrant, tuber; Middle: Spices, fruity notes, lotus, orchid; a very powerful base: vetiver, sandalwood, patchouli, incense, vanilla, dark chocolate, amber. With that much notes it can go two ways: a cacaphonous mess where all these strong notes fight each other to death or a soul caressing harmony, outerworld beauty and olfactory bliss where all those notes pull together to play a team match and score. To make the symphony sound better and more than all seperate notes together. The sign of a True Great. Black Orchid scores big time. \nYou can maybe in the long and lively development sometimes detect some separate notes for a short time like the dark chocolate, the incense, the orchid, the vanilla, the amber... But you are literarlly blown away by this concentrated mass attact of awesome perfume power. Smell and awe. Incense, dark chocolate, orchid, vanilla, amber and gardenia are the most pronounced notes for me.\nThis is an gorgeous tsunami of fragrance brilliancy. This fragrances rocks, like 'Chanel 5' rocks and 'Jicky' rocks and 'Joy' rocks. And will always be rocking. This is Timeless Quality. Here not the top notes lead the dance but the formidable base. They let the middle and top exist, but as a compliment to the power of that exceptional strong base. The middle of orchid, spices, and fruity notes, plus the top of flowers enforce and interact with each other and with the base. They deepen the scent and make it more intricate. The result is one of the most intoxicating frags I know. 'Le Baiser du Dragon' by Cartier is the one that really resemble it the most IMHO. If you think 'Hypnotic Poison' makes you dizzy and giddy with pure delirious pleasure, try this magic potion. It is that magic of your first full blown good wet kiss. It is deep, dark, mysterious, earthy, sex in a bottle, unashamedly powerful strong and sensual. I'm a man, but I can imagine this being a 'man magnet'. It is without a doubt a masterpiece. The only masterpiece perfume of his own house to date sadly, apart perhaps from 'Tobacco Vanilla'. When you put this on you feel like Christine Lagarde of the IMF, Scarlett Johanssen, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jake and Mary Gyllenhall, Uma Thurman, Penelope Cruz all rolled into one. Glamourous, ageless, unisex, beautiful, eternal beauty. A fragrance for strong personalities, but also a fragrance that in applying makes you feel stronger. And let there be not doubt: totally unisex!\nAfter a period I didn't use that bottle, I spritzed again a few weeks ago and now I am lost and addicted, hopelessly in love like an alcoholic who starts to drink after a 10 year dry spell. The power of 'Black Orchid' is that awesome. I quiver, I shiver, I sigh, I sniff myself like crazy. Put me for 24 hours in an isolation cell without food and drink, but give me a bottle of 'Black Orchid', I won't hesitate. \nBlack Orchid is a masterpiece. Despite the ballooned ego of TF anno 2011. \nSo if you like the clasics 'Opium', 'Coco', 'Arp\u00e8ge'... but you also like more modern 'big personality' frags like Narciso, Addict, Midnight and Hypnotic Poison, YSL Cinema, Gaultiers Classique, you'll love 'Black Orchid'. Don't let yourself be persuaded by reviews like mine and other less favorable. Try it and you'll surrender to the magic of Black Orchid. It is a one of a kind tour de force. I don't like Tom Ford since his 'Private Blends', but I love Black Orchid.' To death.", "2": "Imagine a dark forest at night, thick with mist, the moon full and bright.

For men, this is an ADULT fragrance. A confident, secure MAN that knows how to approach and talk to women without coming off as a creep or a dudebro can wear this. This smells like seduction (not sex, learn the difference).  \nI feel confident when I wear this because I know this scent will create an awesome scent memory with whoever encounters me. And as a man of color, this fragrances smells like it was made for me.  \nYes, it's \"supposed to be\" a colder weather fragrance, but I wear this year around...and only at night. It lasts 8+ hours on my skin and it project extremely well. I go 4 sprays at night, 5 sprays if it's a big space or outdoors.

On drydown, it tempers into something sensual that reminds me of Kate Walsh's Boyfriend, which is another love. Don't be afraid to try it ladies! On me, it is also a sillage and longevity BOMB. I love it so much I get annoyed when my husband uses it.", "1": "This is listed as a men\u2019s fragrance, but I love this on myself.Wonderfully smoky and sweet (but not candy sweet) I wear this out when I don\u2019t want to smell like flowers or fruit.

This is a great scent you can pull off almost all year at night. Even on hot summer nights (just go easy on the trigger). Forget all the other notes, its vanilla, tobacco and rum; full stop.

Personally, it's 2022 and I can wear whatever I darn well please so I spritzed this on with zero expectations. The weather is warm today, but that only aids in this herbal smokey sweetness. I feel sultry and delicious and I'm literally wearing a baseball cap and gym shorts...\n\nThe first whiffs were sprinkled with a hint of smoke that has now faded to what reminds me of smelling a cigar wrapper before lit. The sage flicks against the vanilla to balance out any dryness and and it's a sharp and sweet swirl of rum in a thick crystal rocks glass. Ladies and gentleman and whoever the hell else wants in should be free to guzzle this down.", "8": "Opening is praline/vanilla/caramel candy. A little boozy. I thought whisky from a whiff of the bottle, but on skin, it is closer to rum, as described in the notes. The vetiver pops in, giving it an ethereal smokey vibe. The vetiver lingers but the rum dissipates quickly.\n\nThe longer it sits, the more the sweet, sticky praline, vanilla notes dominate. This comes devilishly close to giving me nightmare flashbacks to aggressive tonka fragrances, but it safely stops before crossing the line. It is a \"yummy\" fragrance, which I don't really usually like. But it also has a mature, classy, even vintage vibe to it - like a distant cousin of Chanel No. 5, but one who goes out drinking and bakes a lot of cakes. The vanilla dry down then takes a slightly talcum-y turn.\n\nThe tobacco is there just a touch on my skin, but by far overpowered by the praline-vanilla at the outset.\n\nIn ongoing dry down, the scent becomes more and more subtle. I really like it at the 1-2 hour mark. Projection has gone from maximal to medium/minimal. It sits much closer and the scent left on the skin is really quite beautiful. It reminds me of cozying up with a blanket around a fire with a nightcap. It has transitioned from a loud clap of jazz music to a quiet evening at home. \n\nI don't see it necessarily being a male-only fragrance. The gourmand nature lends itself to unisex application. \n\nMy SO, who always has very imaginative and character-descriptive reviews of fragrances I am trying describes it as follows: it smells like a guy who smokes but wears a cologne he thinks is really nice, but it's actually really cheap. Plus talcum powder.\n\nOur noses are so different.", "9": "Jazz club, one of my first high end perfume purchases! \nI got it in Paris almost 3 years ago at the Margiela store. I smelled it in the store and instantly I knew it fits me.\n\nOn the bottle it\u2019s says the location is Brooklyn, but when I wear it I feel like I am at a Paris cabaret show in the 20s watching Josephine Baker. I feel mysterious and grown up when I wear this.\n\nThe scent is really spicy on me and you definitely do get a mix of whiskey and vanilla cigar scent that lasts until the dry down. \n\nI used to wear it also in the daytime but know that I have more scents I wear this in special occasions or even as a bed time scent because it relaxes me and makes me feel like I am in a 20s bar like I mentioned above watching Josephine dancing or hearing Billie holiday sing.\n\nIf you like spicy, dark, warm fragrances def get your hands on this gold liquid. In my opinion a woman can also pull it off", "10": "This is a fragrant journey. I love Replica because this fragrance gives me the opportunity to immerse myself in situations that I currently don't have the opportunity to get into.\nFor me, this is a very romantic scent.\nIt's like I'm sitting in a jazz club on a cold rainy autumn evening (or snowy winter) and warming up. I am a noir makeup brunette with a strict bun on my head. I am dressed in a gray plaid coat and nothing pleases me except jazz and a man sitting on the right and looking at me with interest.

And yes, I think it is very much a unisex fragrance.\n\nMaison Margiela's describes the scent as \"heady cocktails and cigars.\"  I'd say that's a pretty accurate-ish description.

There's also woody, leathery, and zesty qualities to the perfume as well to compliment the main two \"notes.\" I'm typically not the biggest fan of vetiver, but it works so beautifully here. Everything in this perfume is blended beautifully, and I think it smells wonderful on my skin!\n\nI'd classify this as as a nighttime fragrance.  I think it's both sexy AND classy.", "15": "I don't understand why people don't talk about this more. Its so intoxicating and seductive. It like D&G The Ones stronger older brother.", "16": "I have a hard time with this fragrance. I do love it, but it's tricky to wear. Rum, tobacco, and leather are all things I love to see together. However, I wouldn't call it an exact hit in this cologne. The notes, while they can be appealing, can come off as very chemical and even overly sweet if the cologne is too concentrated. \n\nThat said, there is a smokey sexiness to it. The bottle says that it's \"heady cocktails and cigars\". To me it smells like a highball of rum and cherry Coke with tobacco leaves. The leather is there, but it's in the background. Dark, smokey, with a hint of sticky sweetness. It really does remind me of a bar. An upscale, dimly lit, intimate bar, such as... a jazz club. (What can I say? It's an aptly named cologne.)\n\nI think it's a tad smutty, but in a good way. Think dark, sexy, and confident. It reminds me of the perfect scent for date nights, wearing a sweater with red lipstick, a leather jacket, and sipping cocktails. I enjoy it as a night fragrance for women, but I think it is too sweet to be a fragrance for men. I've received numerous compliments wearing it as women's night fragrance. My boyfriend is particularly fond of this fragrance, even though he tends to have a preference for things that are light and feminine.\n\nI've found there's a trick to wearing this perfume: you can't spray it directly on yourself. If it's too concentrated it starts to smell synthetic, and somewhat like rubbing alcohol. It creates an effect where the cologne smells amazing from a distance, but chemical and harsh up close. The way around this is to spray the air near you and walk through the perfume cloud you've created. Or, if your arms are long enough, spraying it at a distance. It's not just a matter of \"not wearing too much\", it's a matter of making sure the cologne isn't too concentrated to any one area. The sillage is intense, so even in small amounts this scent will still project quite a bit. It's easy to give yourself a headache over applying this fragrance due to it's headiness. Because of these things I find this cologne is one that is best applied lightly.\n\nAgain, I really do love this cologne. It's tricky to apply, and certainly not an \"everyday scent\", but I've found it to be perfect for the right occasions.", "17": "In answer to the question below...\nThis has great longevity but better than Pure Havanne? I don't see them as being worthy of comparison, scent wise and who needs better longevity than Pure Havanne? It's a powerhouse!!!\n\nNot a huge fan of boozy scents as a rule but I've liked a few with rum notes recently so this intrigues and I also love jazz so this fragrance appeals to me before even sniffing it out.\nNow that I have I'm very impressed it's lovely, A kind of boozy, tonka bean and tobacco vibe with a leathery/vanilla drydown. I'll be honest I expected something heavier and more avant garde when attempting to evoke a jazz club vibe. I half expected it to be a bit more raw, dirty, earthy or smokey maybe a heroin note in there? It has a bit of those elements but is pretty smooth and refined on the whole and will appeal to a wide audience I suspect.\nProjection is moderate and longevity is good.\nI'd recommend it.", "18": "Disclaimer - I wear this as a 22-year-old woman, and continue to get compliments from men on it. I can see how it's a male fragrance, but it's certainly the type I'd see an approachable, educated man wearing. It has a refreshing absence of the usual in-your-face \"I AM COLOGNE\" announcement like Aqua di Gio or similar carries with it. It smells more refined yet still approachable, without coming across as stuffy or mature, like amber without the heaviness - it reminds me a bit of Burberry Brit (women), actually. \n\nI wasn't going to pin \"rum\" as one of the notes until I saw it here - but I can smell it now. I smell a bit of cigar, but there is absolutely zero staleness or bitterness and it's really more like that of a hookah-like or incense-like warmth. Underneath is also something papery, a bit like the sweetness of aged books. There is something almost metallic about the scent after the drydown on me, but it's a sort of a warm, brassy metallic that I'm sure the perfumers were after in its namesake.  \n\nGorgeous.", "19": "I LOVE this scent.\n\nI don't get rum from this - but maybe that's because I personally loathe rum as a drink? What I smell is the exact taste of a perfect, boozy manhattan - smoky-sweet carmelly bourbon mixed with that brandied black cherry and bitters. Or maybe an old fashioned - there's some biting, bitter citrus in there, that orange pith rim on the glass. All while settling into a well-worn booth, leather and wood, a hint of something like clove cigarettes or cigars. I'm getting verbose, but as far as the 'replica' scents go, this goddamn nails it in terms of some saturday night fantasy of days of yore.\n\nthe first notes for me are super masculine - and FYI i'm a rather femme and very blonde lady who gravitates towards more 'masculine' scents and loathes most white floral and aldehydic scents - but that pink pepper and citrus smells like far too many average colognes at first. the first whiff seems cheap and cliche, but on me, within five minutes it settles down into that rich complexity mentioned above. \n\ni resent margiela for labeling this as a 'male fragrance' (come on, guys! if any house would manage androgyny or not being so gender-specific....ugh!) as i find this a very unisexy/androgynous/dirty scent. Those masculine top notes settle down into a very sweet, dirty, smoky vanilla that on me lingers close to my skin for nearly 24 hours. Maybe there's some joke there? That the fleeting and shitty top notes go away in a few minutes but smell like every other citrus-pepper fragrance out there, and then immediately change into something different and far more complex? i love that the base notes are sweet, but don't at all feel 'girly.'\n\ni suspect there is a polarizing skin chemistry thing happening here as well - from reviews it seems it goes sour on some folks after a few hours or the bitter notes or cheap 'masculine cologne' bits that faded on me within minutes come out. but on me this is goddang perfect. i find the first few minutes harsh, but after that i will spend the next 12 hours trying to find ways to surreptitiously sniff my own wrist. On me it settles down into this perfect dirty subtle smoky dirty burnt vanilla-amber that lingers for over 18 hours, but only an inch from the skin - which to me is, uh, really sexy. \n\nAnother note is that I have an awful lot of perfumes but most of them have a vanilla/amber/wood/spice base note, and the lingering notes of this work perfectly with that. My scarves and jackets all hold some days of old scents, and if you're a fan of dirty or spicy vanilla/spice/wood/amber bases, this will work just fine with whatever is lingering on your clothes or bedsheets.", "20": "Jazz Club is fragrance that my husband and I share. It works equally well on the both of us. It's that sweet, slightly powdery, spicy kind of scent that we both love. \nRight on top are boozy vanilla mixed with soft tobacco, and towards the bottom you get those woody, peppery notes. \nHowever, this is extremely easy to wear fragrance for someone used to wearing heavy, spicy oreintals. Something that's great for either of us to wear during the daytime and to work without being afraid of choking anyone nearby with our fumes. The sillage stays close to the body, but it lasts a full day. \nLovely! Will get so much wear out this one.", "21": "Jazz Club is another blind buy based on the notes and reviews I have read. I am very glad that I bought a bottle. \n\nJC opens has a Coconut rum soaked white floral opening, although coconut is not listed in the notes. Not being a big fan of coconut or white floral, I am glad that this opening does not last long on my skin. JC develops into a mix of a sweet cigarette and cigar smoke wafting over the leather chairs and well trodden carpet of the club. A boozy tobacco scent that is slightly sweet without being cloying. \n\nMore on the masculine side, but I could see a strong confident woman pulling this one off. \n\nHigh quality juice with good projection and longevity on my skin. Works well in a sports coat or trendy casual attire\n\nBottom line: Put this on, sit back in the slightly smoky lounge, relax into the leather chairs and have your favorite adult beverage.. I will take a whiskey with one large ice cube please...", "22": "I tried a sample today from a recent Sephora order and was surprised how much I enjoyed it since the boozy scents are a big-hit or a bit-miss with me. I basically get sweet-run with a bit of a coconut, a mild non-smoked pipe tobacco and a leather vibe. It's masculine, yet playful, for the man who doesn't take himself too seriously. Suitable for a Fall, Winter or Early Spring Nights while in casual or semi-formal attire.\n\nOkay, I need to define coconut...although sweet, it's not a loud sweetness like you get when tasting Coco Lopez Cream of Coconut or Coconut Flakes. Rather, it's more of a Coconut Oil vibe that hangs in the background and gives Jazz Club a bit of a buttery feel. Moreover, a lot of folks do not detect leather, but it comes through just as clearly as the tobacco vibe to my nose. So I guess I'm getting rum, mild tobacco and soft leather covered in coconut butter. Sounds like a kinky party I hosted back in the 80s. It's no wonder why I like it! LOL!\n\nThis fragrance lasted a solid 8-9 hours on my skin and projected about average, but it left a nice scent trail. Overall, I do like it but it's a little pricey and not one of my favorite boozy fragrances. So I won't be buying a bottle. Still, it's worth checking-out if you're into boozy fragrances.", "23": "This is my favorite maison margiela replica perfume! It\u2019s perfect for autumn and cold weather.

Hopefully I will get it for myself as a christmas gift, so I can wear it for New Years Eve!  ( That is what I did, that year.)\n    I think this is just as lovely, hot and exciting on men and women.

Would like to have an old Chesterfield leather sofa in my livingroom...)", "25": "Jazz Club is described by the house as reminiscent of \"heady cocktails and cigars,\" a beautifully simple bit of imagery to a beautifully crafted scent.\n\nHowever, I don't get so much of a \"jazz\" club vibe. This scent brings to mind a Hollywood archetype of gentlemens' clubs (whisky and cigar houses) from the 1920s and 30s - think Great Gatsby style. Refined, wealthy or powerful men gather in the evening, sinking their silk suits into their tufted leather armchairs, fedoras set atop beautiful oak tables. They talk and chuckle quietly, utterly relaxed, nursing a smoking infused Cuban in one hand and a stiff pour of liquid gold garnished by a lime in the other.  \n\nWhile fairly linear, this fragrance opens with a fresh pop of a lime, with a sweet dark tobacco and rum creeping in underneath. As the opening fades, you get a coconut vibe which are the floral notes giving a smooth powderiness to the vanilla, rum and tobacco accords. \n\nPerformance on this nothing short of stellar, but it does begin to smell stronger of the coconut cream as it heads into the far dry down about 8 hours later. Others around you will notice the perfume, and too many sprays could easily fill up a room with a strong sillage. Another strong one from Maison Margiela.", "26": "Oh lordy what a beautiful fragrance. As a female I had written this one off but it's a beautiful deep fragrance, just sweet enough to temper the boozy tobacco and spice. It would make such a great sexy night time or winter fragrance. Just beautiful.", "27": "Jazz Club opens with a not so boozy rum. A bitter aftertaste lurks underneath the sweetness, which makes the rum more realistic and a nice contrast in itself. I also get a hint of coconut, which makes the smell veer towards being a tropical cocktail.\n\nThe fragrance doesn't change much on me with time, just becomes a bit more creamy with the addition of the vanilla. I can hardly discern nor feel the impact of tobacco and leather. The scent itself is a very nice and gentle combination of booze and vanilla, but I'm disappointed as I expected it to be darker, deeper, or more raw and dirtier, according to the name.\n\nThe sillage is moderate to soft, and the longevity is around 6 to 7 hours. Although I did enjoy Jazz Club, as a fragrance featuring booze, leather and tobacco, I think there're other stronger contenders in this genre. It'd probably make a nice gateway fragrance to this genre, but I'd suggest testing other fragrances as well before settling down.", "28": "Blind bought the 10ml edt spray from sephora. This is one blind buy I'm happy to have gotten. It sprays feminine then quickly goes to tobacco and vanilla with a bit of booze note on the dry down. This fragrance is completely unisex. A man can really rock this to its full potential. Because it's not harsh, I will gladly wear this this upcoming fall as a daytime scent and Chergui in the night as a happy female. Yummy", "29": "This was my signature for a looooong time. I love the sweetness of the rum and the heaviness of the leather. It's absolutely delicious on me, and dark as anything- It's definitely too much for some of my poor friends who've had to deal with its monster silage, but my girlfriend adores it on me, so I guess that's all that matters. Try not to spray with a heavy hand- one or two sprays is more than enough.", "30": "Really quite appropriately named. In my mind it smells like I'm in a room with poor ventilation where friends and acquaintances are lighting up the odd cigarette, we've all been drinking, and someone's poured shots of whiskey. This smells like the initial moment when you bring the shot up to your nose.", "31": "Memory in a bottle? Absolutely nailed it! This fragrance takes me back to when my dad was alive. He'd be in his home office, smoking pipe tobacco and listening to vinyl. Within arms reach would be glass filled neat of bourbon. He'd be sitting in his fine leather chair and bobbing his head to the trumpet of Jack Teagarden. All of those smells and sounds come alive when I wear this. Back in those days as a young lad, that was my jazz club.", "32": "I love this fragrance and couldn't add much to the many positive reviews already on here. The one thing I disagree on is that it's a 'masculine' smell. To me this is perfectly unisex - but I find the whole concept of feminine and masculine scents baffling and slightly annoying, so it could be just me.", "33": "Very nice fragrance for the colder days. Classy, sexy, sweet but not cloying, definitely boozy. Beautiful vanilla-infused tobacco note.\n\nIn the opening, I also get a fresh minty note that reminds me of wintergreen (methyl salicylate). Maybe the clary sage? This one seems a bit off or at least too dominant throughout the opening. As a European who recently moved to the US, I'm extremely sensitive to this note, as it is widely used here (tooth paste, chewing gum, root beer) but rather uncommon in Europe. I'm not a big fan of this stuff. Once it blends in, the scent becomes really good. \n\nA noticeable earthy vetiver surfaces soon after spraying. I first thought this would ruin the fragrance for me (I absolutely hate vetiver, especially the earthier ones), but it turned out to blend in extremely well and move to the background a couple of minutes later. It blends nicely with the tobacco, making it a bit dryer, and creating a nice contrast to the sweet/boozy accord.\n\nDry down is gorgeous. A nice and smooth, well-blended leathery effect with a warm tobacco and vanilla vibe, maybe a touch of cinnamon (styrax?), and a pleasant level of sweetness.", "34": "Yesterday I walked in to a store looking for a fragrance to wear when going out. \nAfter sniffing numerous suggestions made by perfume-lady I bought this one, and I thank her for suggesting it to me.\n\nI'm not an expert on notes but by looking at the Margiela website, and comparing what I smell to the notes listed I am able to make them out.\n\nNotes listed on the website are;\n-Top: pink pepper, lemon, neroli.\n-Middle: rum, clary sage, vetiver.\n-base: tobacco leaf, vanilla bean, styrax.\n\nI instantly get the pepper and a little lemon, the neroli kicks in after about a minute and will come an go throughout whenever it pleases. \nClary sage kicks in shortly after the neroli and this gives the fragrance some freshness, albeit a sweet, spicy freshness because of the rum.\nThe rum is a dark spicy Caribbean rum and is noticeable from beginning to end. The vetiver is quite smooth and sits in the background for a long time. After about 15 minutes this fragrance gets darker/heavier and a little balmy because the vanilla and styrax get stronger. The tobacco kicks in to take some of the sweetness away. After about an hour or a little longer, after everything is blended in, this fragrance gets a spicy, sweet, leathery, smoky, animalic character on me.\nThis is the moment I felt really glad I purchased this fragrance.\n\nIt's a dirty in the good way type of creation.\n\"Jazz Club\" is supposed to evoke the ambiance of a Brooklyn jazz club. It might just do that, if the jazz club doubled as a brothel.\n\nThis fragrance is quite strong, in my case, it will last me all night. \nProjection is good, I sprayed scarcely this morning because I didn't know what to expect. The fact is, I didn't go unnoticed at work. \nIf sprayed heavily, this will turn in to a sillage monster for a good part of the day.\n\nAlthough this is a \"men's\", women can definitely pull this off.", "35": "I had refused to even try this one due to the cigar note (ugh) listed, but was feeling brave today. It is GORGEOUS! By far the most nuanced of MM's line, Jazz Club opens as you'd anticipate from the notes except that the tobacco is more cigarette than cigar smoke and is definitely a background player in the sexiest way--like someone smoking a hand-rolled cigarette just outside the club, where you sit inside, warm and a little bit flushed from the rum.  \n\nThe drydown is where Jazz Club goes from nice to stunning, though. The initial smoky note dies away and the rest of the notes mellow into a seamless blend. On my skin it's warm and spicy-sweet, with the most mesmerizing hint of freshness at the base, maybe the styrax? It reminds me of some of the Big 80s feminine scents: Obsession, Fendi, K de Krizia, Boucheron--with that boozy vanilla note. I will be buying the FB.", "36": "Amazing fragrance.. to me at least anyways on my skin I get if Dior did a men's version of Hypnotic poison. Having said that this is not just for men..very much unisex for it's sweetness. I didn't pick up the tobacco on my skin though I know it's deff. there I got more of a boozy Vanilla..very nice smooth & seductive-esque scent if I didn't have so many fragrances to go through I'd say deff. fb worthy..will keep in mind for future when I finish one of my fragrances off..lol maybe next fall/winter.", "37": "Replica has done it again!\n\nI wore this to an evening event, and I genuinely felt confident.  Plus, with my love of film noir, I came into this fragrance with high hopes that I'd love it.  And I was right.\n\nHaven't tried it during the day, but I think Jazz Club is better suited for a night out.  Most likely NOT office friendly.", "38": "A very sexy masculine fragrance. This is the smell of a tall, good-looking, freshly showered (with fresh gel in his hair) man holding a cigarette in one hand and a drink in the other. Love it.", "39": "Jazz Club is another one one in the long line of booze and tobacco frags being put out by Houses of late and is one of the better ones I have sniffed. Starts off bright actually from the Citruses and pepper but this stage is very short lived, a few minutes tops before it settles into a heart/base mingled stage of Boozy rum notes,dry tobacco and a sweet layer of vanilla holding it all together.\n\nLots of people compare it to DnG's The One but as far as I can tell, the only thing they have in common is a tobacco note. To my nose, Jazz Club reminds me more of a Bvlgari Man in Black with vanilla added. Same boozy,spice mix but sweeter and I actually prefer the addition of Vanilla and styrax here as I think that balances out the fragrance better. Projection is good but not monstrous , it gets noticed without blowing up in peoples faces as they meet you up close. Longevity likewise is good, it's the monsoon out here and I have been using it as an evening fragrance mostly with temperatures between 18-23C and it's been quite stellar.\n\nLike the name suggests, this is a good choice for a night out for drinks and dancing.I will definitely enjoy my decant and might just end up springing for a Full bottle at some point if I can get a good deal. If you like frags like Bvlgari man in Black, Spicebomb etc, do check this out. 8/10", "40": "I get the comparisons to D&G The One, but this has a lot more rum and vanilla than spice. The longevity is also better. Jazz Club is warm, comforting, sexy, and boozy. A bit linear, but what it does, it does very well. Better in colder weather, and pretty unisex.", "41": "This was my Wedding day fragrance, I got married in November which is the time of the year when this is best, weather getting colder and you need something warming. It doesn\u2019t smell as smokey as you may have imagined but it\u2019s the smoothest fragrance I own, much sweeter than it\u2019s name would suggest. Longevity is Average, projection is not the best but it\u2019s a getting close and kind of smell where this works best. I would say indoors is the safest bet for this as if it\u2019s too cold and outside this can get lost too easily.", "42": "Well this is embarrassing.  I'm wearing it as I type this, and just now see that it is \"for men\".  \n\nI don't think it is anywhere NEAR masculine enough to be categorized as \"for men\".  A man could certainly wear it, and not be mistaken for wearing a woman's parfum, but it is not decidedly masculine, to my nose.\n\nIt's very sweet.  The open, to me, is Flowerbomb-esque, then it goes to a sweet vanilla, and I reckon it is the tobacco that I smell.  It's very warm and nice.  I like it good deal.", "43": "Beautiful cool weather scent and HUGE compliment monster!\n\nMade it on my TOP 5 STAY AT HOME FRAGRANCES video.\n\nThis opens up with a blast of rum, tobacco, and vanilla. The warmth lasts for 4hrs+ plus easily on my skin. The scent transports you to a place that feels euphoric and free.\n\nA fantastic alternative to D&G The One EDP if the performance is too weak for you.\n\nThis is a scent for life.", "44": "This scent really lives up to its name. Your sitting in a nice leather chair sipping a rum and coke, smoking your pipe and listening too some calming jazz music.  I can fully imagine being in that situation and at least to some degree smell things in the air that resemble this. It\u2019s a very calming scent for the man who doesn\u2019t need to shout to be heard. The performance on me is good in terms of longevity but it\u2019s definitely \u201cquiet\u201d but I can appreciate it for that as the scent is so calm and comforting to wear. If you get any female (or Male) attention then they will get a lovely surprise when they enter your scent bubble. Fall in a bottle", "45": "The dry down of Jazz Club is an immaculate cozy dream! I got this for my man, but have trouble keeping myself from wearing it. This is the kind of scent that your girlfriend would steal your hoodie for, stashing it away in her closet to snuggle in and smell when she\u2019s missing you.\n\nThe opening is smoky and more tobacco-forward, but this lasts less than an hour on clothes, maybe 30 mins on skin. The dry down is where it shines, leaving an all-day impression of cozy vanilla, rum, and warm resinous woods.\n\nNot a blind buy for those put off by tobacco. Please try it first if you\u2019re hesitant. I personally hate the smell of cigarettes and cigars, to the point where I cover my face with my shirt and run out of the room, but I find this to be such a lovely scent. The only aspect of the tobacco that lingers (if any) is a sweet natural tobacco - not smoke.", "46": "Really love this. It's totally unisex even though it's marketed for men. As a young woman I love the way it smells. There is a sweetness to it, but not in a cloying gourmand kind of way, but if you are really sensitive to sweet fragrances and are into real dry/fresh scents this may be hit or miss for you.\n\nI basically pick up exactly what the fragrance is described as: boozy tobacco notes with a soft vanilla base. I think it's a great replication of what one would think to be a \"jazz club\" scent. Some people say they smell leather and I can see that, as how the tobacco combines with the other notes can smell a bit leathery.\n\nThe other great thing is that it last a very long time- I've worn this while traveling and so far we are going on 8 hours and I'll get a whiff of it still here and there. Sillage is moderate. Nothing too overwhelming but it's there.\n\nA great fall/winter day/night fragrance for men and women to consider trying.\n\n9/10", "47": "Here we go!!! Winner. What a great scent. One of the most well rounded buttery smooth blends in awhile. I bought this a couple weeks ago and don\u2019t regret it. Great for these cold Midwest winters. I\u2019m not huge on sweet scents but this is within my limits. Leans a tad feminine for my dark scent preferences but the notes dance on me and cause a Olfactive orgasim., I always want to keep smelling my hand on this one. Projects perfect. This would be a great date scent too. Great composition. Boozy, tobacco vanilla with sweetness blended to perfection is what I get", "48": "Amazing cocktail of alcohol, vanilla and tobacco. Shares some similarities with Dolce & Gabbana The One, but is deeper, richer and more intense. Simply one of the best boozy fragrances on the market (if not the best). Sorry, CH Men Prive, you don't have any chance against THAT.", "49": "This is definitely unisex. I don't pick up on any leather, just smooth rum and tobacco, nothing heavy or overly syrupy. \n\nI like it but I'm not blown away, though a co-worker adored it on me. I feel like this is an easy compliment-getter. A solid outing for the popular rum & tobacco combo.\n\nSillage is moderate and it lasted a good 7+ hours on me."}, "25": {"0": "This fragrance is simply amazing. It never gets old or boring. It's timeless. It's vintage. It's modern. It's clean. It's dirty. It's captures true expression like a piece of art would an emotion. I would imagine if you have never smelled this before and someone passed by wearing this, your eyes would follow, your expression might drop, and after quickly recovering, that stranger wearing terre d'hermes would be a focal point until they were out of site.  \nMy imagination creates a vivid sensation through this scent of what John Lennon's vintage Gibson acoustic guitar might smell like after being cleaned with a woody orange citrus polish and stored away in an imaginary cedar lined case. That is how powerful this fragrance is to me. Very classy, very powerful, and very stimulating.  \nClean yet dirty, woody fresh yet delightfully aged, orange peel, dirty citrus acidic woods, under ripe ruby red grapefruit, day old orange pulp muddled nicely in a fresh cut cedar mug. A hint of pinecomb, but then again not, perhaps a hint of fresh pine sap that has somehow found a way onto your clothing. You fold it, it's dry and hard and releases it's piney aroma mixed with your sticky fingers from peeling an orange. Imagine, the aroma of cracked pine sap and sticky orange fingers....and the smile that follows. \nVery good projection, in fact unbelievable on my skin. A scent trail so wonderful it turns heads and makes impressions. The rest is up to you..lol. I have received many compliments, and many \"what on earth is that you're wearing?\". Especially at work.

You know, many people have \"opinions\" about who, when, where, and why whatever is appropriate or not about fragrance and how and when it should be worn. \nIf a fragrance makes you feel good inside it's the right fragrance, so wear it....there is no other way to enjoy what you're wearing unless you're enjoying what you're wearing.  \nDress shoes no socks and cut off shorts... \nThe opinions will come as they always do, \nconfidence is key...Fragrances don't come with instruction manuals, just many opinions.... \nTerre D'Hermes is one of the best fragrances I have ever had the pleasure of sniffing. \n8/10 longevity EDT\n10/10 longevity EDP \n9/10 projection EDT & EDP \nEDP/stronger sense of spicy muddled orange\nEDT/ orange woods for a long time........", "1": "I don't understand the age thing everyone is talking about. I first smelled this scent when I was about 11 (2013) and immediately fell in love with it. It was to me, the best thing I had ever smelled. Now, at 20 years old I bought it. And, no - you won't smell stupid if you aren't rich and in your 40s. Every scent works if you are confident and wear it with pride.  \nJust last month, I put it on to test it on my girlfriend, without telling her. About 5 minutes into our date and she \"wanted to rip my clothes off\". Other women also love it on me. Haven't got a bad review yet. Just for the compliment-oriented people. But remember, wear what you like and what makes you feel unique and confident. \nGenerally, you could wear this in all situations, accept for the heights of summer. I wouldn't exactly recommend you put this before a morning coffee date in the summer. It's too heavy for that IMO. But, in general, if you get to know it and ration your sprays, it could easily be an all-year fragrance.", "2": "When I was a girl, probably age 7 or so, I loved to sit on the floor with all of my grandmother's perfumes and samples, Guerlains, Chanels, Estee Lauders, and so on. I would close my eyes and smell each bottle, sometimes testing on my skin, sometimes, when faced with one like Shalimar, leaving it in the bottle where I felt it belonged. My unequivocal favorite was Christian Dior Eau Sauvage, the only masculine scent among them. I expect that now I would find it too bracing and herbaceous, and I have never owned it. But I have found another so-called masculine fragrance that owns me the way that first sniff of Eau Sauvage did. \nI first bought Terre d'Hermes as a blind buy, based on the description by Jean Claude Ellena, who made my favorite scent at the time, Vetiver Tonka. About the sensation of wearing Terre d'Hermes, he wrote, \u201cFeeling the earth, lying on the ground, gazing at the sky.\u201d I was enchanted. I love abstract fragrances, and wearing this scent is indeed an encounter with the idea of the elements. It is a solo encounter. You are lying on a sun-warmed rock, smoothed by time, with salty waves crashing just below you. You are level with the earth and the sky is framed by soft grasses that blow to and fro in the breeze.  \nI don't have the scent in front of me now, but can tell you from memory, as I've owned three bottles. The opening is sharp, as many reviewers have noted. You smell the orange, the grapefruit and a kick of pepper, and hope it develops. It does, and beautifully. The pepper births the woods, which are cedar-dominant. There is something 'flinty', as Jean Claude Ellena has described, which explains the sensation of being on a rock. The minerality keeps the fragrance cool; the rock, of course, is under the sun, which keeps the fragrance warm. It is not the least bit aquatic, but evokes the coastline. On me it lasts all day, and sinks into my skin without ever smelling masculine. It smells fresh with none of the usual 'fresh' suspects. The vetiver is light-handed and lingers longer than the other notes. \"You always smell so good,\" a male friend of mine said. \"Like the ocean.\"", "3": "The first time I smelled this scent was about 5/6 years ago, on a guy that was on his was to have lunch at the same place as me. I was walking about 15 feet behind him and his scent trail was just amazing. My immediate thought was \"this guy smells like money\".  \nFast forward a few years to me watching fragrance reviews on YouTube. As I'm trying to narrow down which fragrances I'd like to try out, the reviewer says the exact same thing about this fragrance (smells like money). Mind you, I had no idea that this was the fragrance that had mesmerised me a few years back. So I added it to my list of scents to try out. \nWhen I found myself at the mall, I went into the fragrance shop and asked them to spray it on a test strip for me. I immediately recognised it. MONEY!! I asked them to spray it on my skin so I could see how it performs on my skin as I walked around. It was perfect. I bought the 50ml bottle just so I could give it a few wears to make absolutely sure that it works for me. I gave this one full wear and I was sold. A lot of reviews said that this is a polarising scent which would be hit or miss with people. After that initial wear I didn't care what anyone around me thought of it. I loved it and I was gonna wear it as my signature scent. \nHowever, it turns out that every time I wear this scent I receive at least one compliment. On one occasion, a guy who went into a restroom a little while after me asked waitresses at a restaurant who the person was that went in before him. After being directed to me, he said he smelled it lingering in the air and HAD TO find out what it was \ud83d\ude02. \nThis scent is absolute perfection to me. I live in a city with moderate climate that ranges from 15-30 degrees Celsius across all seasons. I wear this all year round, day and night. Its lasts about 8-10hrs on my skin, projects about 4-5 feet (just over a meter) and leaves a gorgeous scent trail.

He was holding a woven basket on one hand and his pet a French Bulldog named Pepe Le Pew. \nWhen he had this idea of creating a magical summer scent made with \"8\" ingredients from all over the world that would unite all men during hot summer days.\n\nHe picked a couple of fresh yellow grapefruit straight from its tree and couple of big overly ripe oranges from the dirt that has fell from its tree probably a couple of days old. \n\nHe then went to his outdoor kitchen and squeezed the juices from those fresh grapefruits and big oranges in a large bronze mixing pot.\nHe could smell that it's has and old orange smell, not as sweet, a little bitter and the scent from the dirt has also seeped in through the oranges as well. \n\nTo start creating this mysterious scent, each of the ingredient have to be combined and measured to perfection to achieve the perfect scent he was looking for, no more and no less.\nHe cannot fail, the summer scent for men was on his hands and failure was not an option.\n\nHe started by adding a large bundle of sun dried vetiver grass to add this earthy sweetness, a handful of benzoin resin to add a vanilla like aroma, freshly cracked black and white peppers to add a little spice and hand picked patchouli leaves and pelargonium/geranium flowers to add a sense of refreshing freshness into the bronze pot filled with grapefruit and orange juice.\n\nHe then mixed the \"7\" ingredients and put them in a copper still. The fire has been started and the temperature of the liquid has to be consistent. The ingredients was slowly cooked to perfection. \nSteam from all the ingredients slowly started to evaporte and gather on the cover of the still. \nHe can finally start to smell the scent, but he knows something was still missing.\n\nAlong with the steam, precious oil was also collecting below the copper still cover. A narrow copper pipe is connected to the cover, it runs down, around and a few feet straight through a cold fresh water stream that helps to cool down the hot oil.\nAt the end of the pipe was the final and 8th ingredient that completes the unfinished scented oil...a jar made of cedar wood that becomes the container and gives subtle woody scent to the cologne. \nOnce the cooled oil drips from the copper pipe into the wooden cedar jar, it mixes with fresh water from the Alps. \nThe adventure of the perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena is now finished.\n\nFinally, a cologne that will unite all men during hot summer days has been created .\n\nThe magical summer juice was called  \"Terre d'Hermes Hermes for men\".\nAnd alot of men lived happily from that summer until now...\nThe End... = )\n\nAnd yes I was so bored why I wrote this.\n\nThanks for being bored like me and finished reading this.\n\nI made up the fairy tale and science of making colognes, but I am SERIOUS with the ingredients that is used to create this wonderful cologne.\n\nI don't know why I came up with this story. I don't even know how oils are harvested and mixed to the right amount.\nI guess, I just want to do a unique review on colognes.\n\nMy overall rating is 9/10", "7": "Ok.\nI'm ready to fucking write this.\nI'm going to let it all hang out.\n\nI have always loved citrus.\nThe problem is that citrus as an aromachemical is volatile.\nFleeting.\nEspecially orange.\nOrange.\nMandarin or otherwise, \nlike Clementines,\nor Cuties as I call them.\nI cannot tell you how many I have tried.\n\nI'm built like a brick shithouse.\nBut when I was a school-kid I was small. \nI got fucked with, kicked around.\nThey stole my money and/or lunch.\nThey never took the orange. \nThey never took the plum.\nOr the tangerine.\n\nThis scent has my orange or my tangelo, or my south street cutie\nit has clay and dirt and metal\nit has woods\nbut my cutie or tangelo or orange is still there\nall the way through.\n\nThis scent with my natural musk ...\n\nThis is a great, great scent.", "8": "This is no ordinary perfume, this is a masterpiece, and I'll give you three reasons why. 1) Dry natural feeling top quality vetiver: refinement; sweet-citrusy orange: pleasantness; spice-earthly combo: patchouli, geranium, pepper: density, complexity, mistery; all these notes in a alluring just-right amount of volume: ART. 2) Probably the most versatile fragrance out there. This goes year-round in terms of weather - summer, winter, this manages all, suitable for the office, suitable to casual runs. Forget Aventus, that can't scratch the surface of the impact this has on making a man smelling like he should in most situations possible. 3) I hated this fragrance, back a few years ago when I started in this hobby and didn't know shit about perfumes. I blind bought this, sprayed it on for two office runs, hated it - \"argh, too harsh and rotten orange like\", sold it immediately. Man, talk about regret.

What else could you possibly expect when Herm\u00e8s goes \"earthly\"? Recommended.", "12": "Smelt this in a department store today. Is honestly the first fragrance I have instantly thought \"wow\" with. Beautiful citrus opening that calms down into something delicate yet at same time masculine and bold. 8.5/10.", "13": "It's like a smell taken from the core of the earth mixed with woods and the forest, raw orange and air.It's pretty strong but smells fantastic!!", "14": "Terre d'Herm\u00e8s is one of the best men marketed recent releases. It's a true quality scent, which pleases everyone.\n\nIt starts with a burst of citrus, I can definitely say that the most noticeable one is orange, and it dries down to a very peppery-woody-citric scent, with vetiver and orange, again (as you can see, orange is there from the beggining) being the main notes. I can also say that benzoin can be detected, giving a balmy feel to the scent, although is not proeminent.\n\nThe thing about Terre d'Herm\u00e8s is that it is a fragrance for everything: for every ages, every seasons and every occasions. It's not too mature for a young one to wear, and it's not too young for an old person to wear. It will fit every single season; I would avoid it just in extreme hot conditions. It can be used in formal events, as well as casual every day meetings and life. There are very few perfumes who can adapt to everything like this one.\n\nThe quality of the ingredients are top notch: it smells so mild and natural, like we're in the desert, and suddenly, we get the refreshing scent that the wind brought of an orange tree.\n\nThe longevity is very good (7-10h) and the sillage is noticeable, never being too loud, but loud enough for people to understand you're wearing perfume (and a good one).\n\nIt's a success in sales, and perhaps that's Terre's biggest problem: it's a bit too mainstream. But, who cares? Most men don't wear perfume, so go for it!\n\nIf you're looking for a neutral fragrance that fits every person, age, climate, and occasions, this is the right one to buy!", "15": "I love this! Fresh and dirty all in one!\n\nIt has a unique blending of orange and vetiver notes which work incredibly well in any situations.  I see the expression \"swiss army knife\" used for scents on here, this is surely one of the best of this type.\n\n2-3 sprays will stay with you for a full working day. Many times I have thought this scent has gone then from nowhere it emerges in all its glory.\n\nTicks all the boxes in my opinion. Smells great. Performs great. Versatile. Unique quality. Good price. Nice bottle.\n\nEssential classic scent!\n\n9/10", "16": "you will jump bunch of colognes throughout your fragrance journey . leathery, oud, sweet, gourmand, shower gel types of colognes will come and go in your wardrobe... one and only bottle, which will stay forever there is gonna be Terre d'Hermes...

We like it on ourselves, and we like it on each other. This is the scent of the forest just after a hot summer day. This is the smell of campfire, but not the noisy summer camp kind. It's an intimate fire for two, in the middle of the forest, with nobody else around but deer and foxes and birds. It's not entirely dark yet, and the magical, translucent light of dusk mingles with the smell of gently burning dry wood. Beautiful.", "18": "Terre d'Hermes is a truly unique blend of flinty earth, charred wood, orange peel and ozone. Quite possibly it is the best of the modern masculines.\n\nTerre comes in two flavors, the original EDT and the Parfum which comes in a smaller bottle for the same price. Though more concentrated, the Parfum stays closer to the skin with less sillage, and requires the same number of sprays as the EDT. Try both on skin before you buy as they are quite different.\n\nTerre EDT is an orange peel thrown at the foot of a dwindling wood fire at the edge of a cedar forest. It is cold stone, mineral and ozonic. It is literally burnt orange.\n\nTerre PARFUM is the same orange hours before, uneaten but baking in the noonday sun. The cold mineral accord is gone but the cedar and charred wood are there, and the whole thing is somehow rounder, fresher, more ripe than the EDT.\n\nNOTE: The wonderful cedar accord that is the base of both versions of Terre d'Hermes is notorious for causing olfactory fatigue. Meaning the Terre you smell today will be missing half its glory tomorrow. I have waited up to two weeks between wears of the EDT, which I own, and still can't smell the cedar.", "19": "I keep telling myself I\u2019ve not buy a Terre D\u2019hermes But it\u2019s the 5th time I\u2019m ordering it. This should reflect to you how much of a great scent this cologne is. Should be given the citrus scent of the century. To attract a lot of compliments. Layer it with Cartier D\u00e9claration and spray this... in less than a minute you\u2019d be blown away", "20": "I wear different fragrances for different reasons. Some are daily office wears, while others are more tied to my social life. Some are chosen for traveling, picked especially to not choke out the person next to me on a flight, while others are loud declarations that I want to instill in my memories of various adventures.\n\nI wear Terre d\u2019Herm\u00e8s as a signature to project the way I want the world to see me every day, whether I happen to be wearing it or not. I smell maturity - years of diverse experiences that have shaped, and to an extent curated, a complex worldview and set of aesthetics. I smell an adventurous spirit - a readiness for years more of new experiences. I smell confidence. And I smell humility. All of these virtues depend on a delicate balance. To me, a well blended medley like Terre d\u2019Herm\u00e8s serves as the perfect metaphor for a well blended life.\n\nI don\u2019t always feel this way about myself personally, but I think the projection of these associations helps me get there. Don\u2019t underestimate the power that senses hold over the human psyche, and in this case, confidence transcending insecurity.\n\nI first smelled this in late 2019, so I\u2019m about 15 years late to the table. I\u2019ve often read that though many consider this a masterpiece, it has been worn to death by everyone, and as such some consider it an extremely boring reach. Fortunately for me, I don\u2019t typically frequent places where people might be wearing this much. Even if I did, I don\u2019t think I would be bothered by it\u2019s ubiquitousness.\n\nI also own the Eau Tres Fraiche and Eau Intense Vetiver flankers and love them pretty equally in their own rights. I think it is a rare occurrence to love every single variety of a given fragrance. That, paired with the fact that nothing has wowed me quite as intensely as Terre d\u2019Herm\u00e8s so far, makes me comfortable calling this my signature even though I pull from a vast selection of fragrances from day to day.\n\nMy next step will be layering the pure parfum, the only flanker I have yet to purchase, with the EDT to try to broaden the spectrum and extend the boundaries of depth in the limitations of each version. Crazy talk, I know.\n\nAnyway, A++ forever. Clearly. This might be received as over the top and silly, but I want to be candid about this one.", "21": "I smelled this years ago and got it straight away. It smells like this middle aged Lebanese dude that worked in a gas station by my house, he was an absolute asshole, real pos, constantly rude, zero social skills but he smelled unreal.  \n\nI never asked him but now I know it was 100% this he was wearing, brings back good memories though... of the time, not the gas station, I really wanted to go full open season and batter him into outer space, but what annoyed him most seemed to be when I was nice to him, what a douchbag fck him and that gas station. \n\nAnyway, this is a beautiful earthy frag that's best in the summer. NOT the winter, the cold does something to this that's unfavourable.\n\nUPDATE - I MUCH prefer the Parfum by far, see my review on that. \nfor summer 9.5/10", "22": "I blind bought this one and when I first sprayed it, I really disliked it. I was puzzled how come so many people were talking positively about it. But for some reason, I sprayed it on my wrist, just to sniff it from time to time while I'm working at my desk. \nWith time, I \"learned\" to like this fragrance. Now, I really enjoy it and I find it very elegant. It is a controversial one, some people love it, some hate it and probably few people like me change their mind along the way and learn to love it.", "23": "This is my perfect cologne. Just so many different layers, citrus and then notes of flint and gunmetal. Awesome all around fragrance. Will probably go down as one of the greatest of all times. \n\nSuper natural smelling too, long lasting, and very complex. It has so many different levels overall. I love this cologne and everyone should definitely try it out!", "24": "I wore this fragrance all summer. Exploring the city, having picnics in parks, going to the beach, going to parties on rooftops, falling in love with my boyfriend. All to this beautiful scent. It smells like you're in an orange grove full of ripe juicy oranges and it's just rained, but now there is brilliant sunlight, and next to the orange grove is a pile of flint being warmed in the sun after the rain. It's so lovely and effervescent. It smells natural but luxurious. I will always own a bottle, for the smell and the memories. I intend to make many more with it.", "25": "I once had a friend tell me you only need two fragrances in your life. Terre D'Hermes and Terre D'Hermes Eau Tres Fraiche. He isn't wrong. An absolute MONSTER from spray one. Can be intimidating if you've never smelled it before. However, just let it be. Don't scrub, don't attempt to rub a little away, just let it do it's wonderful, exquisite thing. I promise you, if you can suffer the initial punch to the nose you will be rewarded with a long-lasting, earthy citrus like never before. If Hermes ever announces they are discontinuing this, I will need about 9 bottles.", "26": "Having read the reviews, I was a bit hesitant in buying because it seemed like an older guys scent. As a man in his early 20's, it didn't seem appropriate.\n\nThat all changed when my brother bought a bottle and I tried it. It was like love at first sight! It's an incredible scent with so much sophistication yet versatile. I don't think its an older man's scent. \n\nThe grapefruit is really striking at first but once it mellows out and the base notes emerge, it's divine!\n\nWould definitely recommend it!", "27": "One of the most evocative designer (no niche) fragrances that I have ever smelled. Terre d'Hermes (TDH) it has a very ''organic'' smell. Sincerely, I detect enough the ''earthy'' aspect but not too much rough if not rather soft.

Am I the only woman who wants to wear this??", "29": "Terre D\u2019Hermes EDT opens with a moderate to a strong projection of sweet, citrus, green, spicy notes. The opening is fresh, classy, mature, elegant, delectable, and inviting. The orange, vetiver, and pepper are opening prominent notes. The orange is a delectable, sweet, citrus, and mildly sour note, it feels natural, juicy, and inviting. The vetiver is the note that makes the fragrance feel mature and classy, earthy, grassy, hay, woody, and green. Both combine creating a great balance. The pepper is one step behind with a spicy touch that enhances both featured notes. As the fragrance moves towards its dry down, the cedar develops introducing a very fresh, bright, woody note. The rest of the notes are there to provide support but don\u2019t have any significant participation, the faint green touch of the patchouli, and a sweet resinous touch of the benzoin are the most noticeable support notes. The fragrance is relatively linear, the sweet, moist, and tasty orange is a more noticeable than the vetiver during the opening, but they swap places towards the dry down, the vetiver does its job making the fragrance feel dry and earthy. Finally, the initial projection takes a step down to moderate. Once Terre D\u2019Hermes EDT has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, sweet, green vetiver, citrusy orange, fresh woody cedar, and spicy pepper fragrance with benzoin and patchouli accords. The fragrance feels casual, classy, delicious, diurnal, dry, earthy, elegant, energizing, formal, fresh, grassy, green, high-quality, masculine, mature, office-ready, playful, professional, resinous, refined, relaxing, sharp, sophisticated, sour, sporty, sweet, versatile, wild, woody, zesty, and very pleasant.\n\nBATCH REVIEWED: 2019 (#EGB#3).\nWOW RATING: 10/10.

Manly, playful, sporty, earthy. Sexy but not seductive. Sweet but dry. This was the one that made me want to start a collection because of the way it affected my mood throughout the rest of the day. I felt like a million bucks. I don't know what it was, maybe the vetiver that stuck out so much that I was smelling myself for over 24 hours. I don't receive too many compliments but generally people DO like it. I wear it more for myself because I love the scent. I bought it on a crisp fall day, so it always reminds me of the fall and that is when I wear it the most. It was my signature for about a year so, yes, you can wear it year around.\n\nNow lets talk about the scent for a minute. I must admit that I am not too crazy about the opening. It isn't necessarily bad but it is a bit too grapefruit citrusy. Reminds me a bit of those chocolate orange peels. Within the first 1-5 minutes of applying it I have had at least 5 people tell me that I smell like pine-sol, which I don't get at all, but there seems to be a pattern. The dry down is where this one gets really good and I will try to put it into words. To start, it is subtle and does not project too monstrously, but on a breezy fall day you are going to get plenty of whiffs. You will get a lot of vetiver, but not too overpowering. It is a dirty, earthy vetiver but the orange is going to give it a touch of sweetness. Picture a big hunk of cedar that has been rubbed with vetiver and orange peels. In my opinion, the grapefruit is almost gone but you might pick it up a teeny tiny bit. It is almost metallic, but in a sweet and soft way. I absolutely love it and this one is going to last you at least 8 hours sometimes up to 24.\n\nNow this has been very interesting in terms of compliments. As I mentioned earlier, people think the opening smells like pine-sol or some kind of cleaner. In my year of wearing it I received only one compliment from a male, and he is one of my best friends. Guys don't really tend to compliment guys too much. I did however receive some great compliments from women. A girl I worked with at the time came up to me mid shift one day and asked \"Is that you that always smells so good?\" She took a good whiff of me and, yes, it was the TdH. My girlfriend and her female friends all loved it. They found it to be very masculine and a bit sporty/playful. Once I started to wear new fragrances I had a friend tell me that she missed my \"old cologne,\" referring to TdH. It was interesting because that particular friend never complimented me when I wore it, but brought it up months afters I stopped using it frequently. So keep in mind that just because you don't receive compliments doesn't mean people don't smell you.\n\nLast thing, this makes a great signature fragrance.\n\nRating\n\nUniqueness: 9/10\nLongevity: 8.5/10\nProjection: 8/10\nScent: 9.5/10\nOverall: 9/10", "36": "I bought this fragrance for the first time in 2008 and as much as I liked it back then, I feel like I was too young to fully appreciate its beauty. Nowadays, being almost 30, it has definitely become my signature scent. It's sublte yet powerful. Mysterious yet familiar.

Here in Mexico, perfume lovers don\u2019t have too many options, so I profited every visit to an US mall to access a more extended universe. But still no scent seemed to meet all the features I was looking for.\nI had tried a couple of Hermes Jardins, but considered them maybe too extravagant and unisex for me. At the end, always skeptically, I sprayed TdH on my arm, and waited several minutes until the alcohol vanished. My first impression was \u201cNot bad, I could give away this to my brother and make him forget ADG\u201d. But then I got addicted to smell my arm, and one hour later I definitely wanted to eat it.\nThere was no more need of search. The fact now is that I\u2019m addicted to TdH and I use it even if I stay at home. I read somewhere that TdH is for the man who is self-confident and doesn\u2019t need to prove anything to others. I totally agree, I don\u2019t care if others like it, just like I don\u2019t care if others like me.\nTechnically I don\u2019t think I'm qualified to describe it: I only detect bitter orange peel, vetiver and pepper, though after an hour it gets woodsier and less peppery. For me, the magic of TdH is how it captures your senses and doesn\u2019t allow you to grab it nor analyze it (just like a Rubens or a Vermeer). To fully appreciate it, you have to be more intuitive, though I\u2019d like to have a trained nose and professional reasons to love it.\nComparisons? Well, I usually don\u2019t like citrusy smells, as I wrote before, but this could perfectly be the non-formal brother of Allure Edition Blanche, which is creamy and claims \u201cI\u2019m here in this special summer night, wearing a nice designer suit, with a girl in a cocktail dress\u201d, whereas TdH only would need to say \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m a man, yes, attached to the earth, but, isn\u2019t that reason enough for you to look for my arms?\u201d.\nFor daily use at office, self-confident, distinctive.", "48": "God I love this stuff. \n\nAddictive. A true masterpiece.", "49": "Enough has been written about this stuff that anything I add will surely be superfluous, so I'll keep this brief: Somehow, 16 years after its release, Terre d'Herm\u00e8s still smells like nothing else. You either love it or you don't, and if you do, you've probably been wearing it for years and have no intention of stopping (join the club, we have donuts in the next room). But even if you hate it, you can't deny its uniqueness, its clarity, and its bold coloring. Smelling it \"on the street\" is like greeting an old friend, one who made an impression on you years ago and has lost none of his charm. Breaking Terre d'Herm\u00e8s down into its component accords - bergamot, cedar, flint, you know the drill - does exactly zero justice to the experience of wearing it. It's an aura as much as a scent, one that's easygoing yet utterly distinctive, outdoorsy but refined, sparkle and sunshine with a dashing grin. A one of a kind, once-in-a-generation touchstone. Even if you never wear it, you need to smell it."}, "26": {"0": "My eldest son wore this and it will always remind me of him. Sadly he passed away at the age of 23, but this smell brings him back into the room. He was a junior doctor, working in London and as soon as I smell Bleu de Chanel I am transported back to meeting him in the city, sitting at a restaurant ready to eat, being engulfed in his huge strong embrace, seeing his handsome face and watching his smile light up the room. The first thing I would say to him...every single time... was 'you smell so good,' and he would laugh because I always said the same thing, but he truly did smell amazing. This is masculine, intelligent, classy, and sophisticated; it's mysterious, warm, inviting, and captivating. It doesn't scream at you, although the smell will linger in your memory forever. Bleu de Chanel is the confident signature of the man who easily embodies its classy sentiments.", "1": "I wonder how many of these reviews will get edited after they realised that this is a great frag (just like the EDT) some of you reviwers really are sad.

If you're not fully into fragrances and have no desire for a large collection and you just want something that smells really good and is super versatile this might be the one for you. Cold weather warm weather day or night work or play this will get the job done admirably at that. Better than YSL Y and Dior Sauvage imo.", "4": "I suppose we can debate the merits of Bleu de Chanel Eau de Parfum until we are all \u201cbleu\u201d in the face and nothing will be resolved; nonetheless, I am here to tell you that Chanel does not make junk. This company is a worldwide phenomenon and the owners, the Wertheimer brothers, have 6.3 billion reasons to maintain fastidious control over the quality and distribution of their products. Wearing Chanel fragrance, like wearing Chanel couture, is a mantle of discovery with many layers, often as incomprehensible as it is playful and alluring. That is called Chanel mystique. You either get it or you don\u2019t. Whether this is due to Mr. Polge\u2019s efforts alone or some other factors I can\u2019t say, but it would be hard for anyone to believe that he could be creating fragrance after fragrance for more than thirty years if he did not possess a devilishly extraordinary (and monetarily successful) nose.  \nIf you think back to the origins of Chanel, you may remember that Coco Chanel not only freed women from corsetry, but made an art of mocking the very Edwardian prudes she converted, ladies who formerly rejected her in society until she made them all want to wear her little gray and navy uniforms. Decades later, when the Chanel look became dated, creative director, Karl Lagerfeld (who understood her divine contempt), was hired to revive the brand by producing unexpected, masterfully crafted, incomprehensible couture and the name \u201cChanel\u201d once again ascended the worldwide stage. Chanel is God. Chanel is Satan. Chanel is all the good and bad in all of us, and some of us hate it and others love, love, love it. But if you think you are laughing at Chanel, please know there is a lot of cackling going on at 31 Rue Cambon, all the way to the Banque de France. \nBleu de Chanel EDP is subject to all of the above. You must pay the price to wear it, and wearing it is like wearing the whole history of the company with all of its strange idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. Attempts to diminish Bleu de Chanel EDP by saying it smells like deodorant or some amalgam of chemicals are just na\u00efve. Chanel pulled all its fragrances from drugstore shelves in the 1970\u2019s to increase its luster and exclusivity. Beyond this, Chanel marketer Jean Hoene has been quoted as saying \u201cWe introduce a new fragrance every ten years, not every three minutes.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine, with so much restraint and guile attributed to this brand, the House of Chanel would take the low road by releasing a trash fragrance. Such a premise would be a non-sequitur anywhere those interlocking letters appear under license. \nThere is no tidy way to describe Bleu de Chanel EDP, just as there is no tidy way to sum up the influence of Chanel on fashion. The notes taken together seem to create something abstract or quixotic and the \u201cprofessional\u201d sample sniffers who promote enthusiasm for long extinct fragrances that have become fetid with the years and can only be purchased second hand are not qualified to critique Bleu de Chanel EDP, which is, in my opinion, pure modern luxury. There will never be another (1981) Chanel Antaeus, but there is good stuff in this flask. For example, if you bother to read the discreet embossing on the back of the box you will see that Bleu de Chanel EDP contains among its components extract of evernia prunastri or oakmoss (not listed in the pyramid above). Now restricted by IFRA, you will have to go far to find a comparably priced, recent release that contains the complex woody aroma of natural oakmoss. That\u2019s just one of this deep blue bottle's little secrets.  \nOccasionally, I will write a negative review, but I haven\u2019t made a life\u2019s work out of it. I would rather write about things which give me pleasure. The true irony here is that the \u201cchemists\u201d, on the other hand, are often so intent on lampooning certain molecules they hate that they fail to recognize some of the better attars because their assumptions and egoism get in the way. However, if you keep an open mind (and you have established the funding) there are many things in life which hold delight: I believe Bleu de Chanel EDP is not only one of them, but can\u2018t be anything less.", "5": "Fresh, sharp and scrubbed clean.

The problem is obviously you and not the cologne, that goes for any cologne you choose to wear.

The overall composition lingers through to dry down, rather than the individual notes rising and falling in prominence. It is citrus heavy on top, with the main note being grapefruit.

In the opening there is a citrus accord that smells like a mix of deep yellow lemon and grapefruit. Very refreshing and very attention grabbing.\n- Second strong impression. The not strong balsamic and smoky incense/amber base notes frame that actualy makes this fragrance a bit less blue and stresses the woody facet of it. Due to this accord, the fragrance gains performance but above all, it excell in the wearability and versatility domains.\n- Third remark. The wood notes are superb although not dominant. They add a lot of class and masculinity to the dominant \"bleu\" panorama.\n- Fourth and last reasoning. As a masculine and manly perfume, the scent must please the ladies around us. And it does it quite well.\n\nI do have other designer blue fragrances that I probably wear more frequently, like Mauboussin Private Club or even Versace Dylan Blue.

Purchased at Macy\u2019s on March 8th 2020-\n\nMan this stuff is absolutely incredible. There\u2019s a lot to say about this fragrance so I\u2019ll start with the broad statements first-\n\nThis fragrance is a modern masterpiece and there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s so popular and so copied, because it\u2019s f**king AMAZING. I\u2019ve tried a lot of the fragrances that obviously try to ape off this formula/composition (Y EDP, Dylan Blue, Sauvage, Luna Rossa Carbon to a lesser extent) and I can confidently say, this Is king And blows them all out of the water and it\u2019s not even close. \n\nI get so tired of hearing how fragrances are \u201cplayed out\u201d or \u201ctoo trendy\u201d or whatever you wanna say. Nobody cares. Unless you\u2019re  an obsessive fragrance enthusiast people care about one thing: do you smell good? And with this fragrance, you will smell good, guaranteed. I actually am a fairly obsessive fragrance enthusiast and I still don\u2019t care if it\u2019s \u201ctoo popular\u201d (it\u2019s almost comical that\u2019s even a complaint from some), because it\u2019s easily in the top 3 fragrances I own and I\u2019ll wear it any day of the week.\n\nThe scent itself is perfection: it opens up crisp and blue, but with a touch of spice. This is not some fleeting, airy citrus fragrance: this is a beautifully blended and DEEP fragrance that opens up with beautiful and crisp citrus/grapefruit notes. In ways it can remind me of Polo Blue, especially the Polo Blue EDP formulation, but much better. You definitely get a deep blue/aquatic feeling, but not really like a daytime beach, more like a luxurious private pool overlooking the evening ocean sunset as you relax with your loved one. \n\nThe blending of citrus, fresh spice and beautifully deep and resinous woody notes is absolutely gorgeous. It\u2019s a scent I never tire of. Many fragrances, even those I love, simply have their time and place and if it\u2019s not the appropriate setting for them, they can be overwhelming or unwanted. This, along with L\u2019Homme Ultime, are my two favorite scents and insanely versatile. I would wear these in any situation, any season, any time of day, without hesitation. \n\nWhile I enjoy all the BdC iterations, this one is my favorite currently. It\u2019s not loud, and it lasts a very long time on my skin. It projects nicely, just nothing crazy, and it\u2019s just pure class in a bottle. While many scents can smell classy, they also often come off as too mature and not really invigorating or youthful, or again only being appropriate in certain situations. Not so with BdC EDP, a true masterpiece and one of my favorite scents of all time. \n\nTL:DR, skip the copycats, ignore the nonsense about it being \u201ctoo popular\u201d, and just do it. The copycats can\u2019t hold a candle to this masterpiece. One of the most important designer scents of the past decade. \n\n10/10", "43": "There is surely nothing I can say that hasn\u2019t already been said in the 100\u2019s of reviews before me.

With that said, I\u2019m an idiot. \n\nAvoiding something simply because it\u2019s popularity, isn\u2019t a good game plan. \n\nThe reason this is so popular is due to one simple fact: it smells great. \n\nAnd when something smells great... you wear it...(I.e. you get what you paid for!)\n\nThe only thing I\u2019ll add is that this is one of my longest lasting fragrances. 12+ hours.\n\n7/10", "44": "This was my dad's signature scent. I remember him asking my brother and I to get him a bottle for $160. I wasn't into the cologne game at the time, and neither was my brother. However, we both thought he was out of his mind LOL. \n\nHowever, having giving this more time with the bottle my dad had left behind, I have come to appreciate this scent all the much more.", "45": "Just bought a 150ml a couple of months ago and I'm really enjoying it this summer. It is one of my wife's favorites out of my collection and she always requests that I wear this one on more formal occasions because it has a very classy and sophisticated vibe that some other fresh fragrances tend to lack. Like the original it still has that sporty aquatic straight out of the shower vibe to it, but the incense, patchouli, and oak moss have been amped up to give it a more luxurious feel. \n\nThe opening is sweet, a kind of fruity musk with grapefruit, ginger, nutmeg and patchouli, the fragrance comes into its own about an hour after application, with vetiver, incense and the subtle animalic notes of ambergris/ambroxan coming into their own. These ingredients smell plenty of quality: round and clear citrus, peppery incense-y woods, and subtle musks. Even if Bleu de Chanel does not break new grounds, its balance and quality will not go amiss if one simply wants to smell fresh and feel well-groomed.\n\nThe seductive aroma of Bleu EDP opens the doors of palaces in the East, and makes you relive the mesmerizing oriental mysteries. In the top, musk is gradually gaining strength by absorbing the sugary heart and the sensual scents of sandal wood and incense. The feeling of bliss and pleasure overtakes when the secrets and surprises of this beautiful fragrance are discovered.\n\nBleu EDP has all the essential aspects of a great fragrance. It\u2019s a scent that is romantic yet mischievous, appealing to bold stylish youth of all ages. Designed for those who are versatile, smoothly adapting to prevail over situations & people, those who are confident and don\u2019t have to brag about their accomplishments. A fragrance that\u2019s a facade of nonchalance before its wild characteristic comes roaring through! \n\nI've never once received any type of negative reaction from it even if it is over sprayed. I also think Bleu EDP is severely underrated in the performance department because people around me mention that they can smell it even 12 hours after application. If you don't have this fragrance you are really screwing yourself because the beautiful memories you will receive from it are just priceless.", "46": "This is probably the best fragrance in my collection.\n\nLongevity, projection, scent, sophistication. All 10/10\n\nIf I want a guaranteed positive impression by a fragrance, I pull off Bleu de chanel\n\nThe EDP is far better than the EDT.", "47": "Best flanker and best blue fragrance, versatille and quality by chanel", "48": "People do not believe the lies. Bleu de Channel edp has never been reformulated. I have a 5 FL. OZ. bottle with batch code 1501 produced in march 2017 and who says it has been reformulated, has a fake. Bdc edp is still very strong and long lasting. One of the best fragrances out there.", "49": "This is a fragrance that executes simplicity very well similar to Sauvage; it's not that it's like \"OMG I've never smelt something so amazing\" no, it's not that at all. It's that both BdC and Sauvage do something very well which is take a very simple premise and turn it into something gorgeous! \n\nBdC is classy and clean for sure and if you are a man who can only pick 1 fragrance then this is probably your best bet (screw Sauvage if u have just 1 fragrance to choose). BdC EDP has a sophisticated nuance about it that only Chanel can do. Whereas Sauvage does what Dior does and that's make Sensual fragrances that can be worn everyday. \n\nYes I know on the surface we could judge this as \"Shower Gel\" but I'd say that's a very shallow perspective tbh but i get it. It does on some level resemble expensive shower gel but it's a little more complex then we would like to admit because when others smell us they dont get what we (the person wearing) get. \n\nMen, if you are wondering \"Durr should i buy this? it is over 100 dollars\" yes, if you have only 1 fragrance you ever want to wear in your collection than BdC is probably the first and only one you need and for the price that's a great thing! \n\nThis has something about it, it's masculine on the base with how woody it is but it is very fresh and energizing with the ginger and grapefruit. \n\nSauvage for a while was like THE thing that the ladies loved but now its almost 4 years and to be honest most ladies don't respond to Sauvage the same way they did before, BUT they (Women) still respond pretty similar to BdC even though it's been around longer and thats what you are really paying for with this fragrance, it's CONSISTENCY! \nNo, don't buy AdG! Buy BdC! You know how many ppl wear some form of AdG? And for how long? \nBdC is literally that same premise, a consistent and every day scent that works on literally any man regardless of work or occasion. \n\nOFC it's Chanel so it won't be discounted but like I said, it's a investment in yourself and your image and although I'm not trying to advocate prideful behavior I am trying to help enhance your image in yourself and how others may see you. \n\nThis is everything you want in a mens fragrance, that's all there is to it and I know ppl suck Aventus off but meh, BdC is the consistent staple that every man needs!\n\n\nAlso The DryDown is very Iso E (Super?) based, so it has this aromatic woody spicy thing going on for it. Like it's a lot of Iso E in here but I like Iso E so yeah it's great. Just thought I should say this does change a little bit from opening although it is present in the opening it is the thing that continues to persist throughout the lifecylce of this scent when that ginger/grapefruit vibe begins to die."}, "27": {"0": "This perfume is gorgeous! I saved up for weeks and weeks to get a bottle of this, and when I finally bought it I felt like I'd won the lottery.

It's an AMAZING fragrance of course many people are gonna wear it!\nThere is alot of debate on this though, you either love it or hate it, at the end of the day it is just a perfume and some of the comments here are kinda outragous considering that it's just a perfume, if you hate it, then cool, no need to BASH on it because some people love it.

She is an amazing woman who can dig in the dirt one hour and then be dressed and ready for the opera in the next. She taught me to love and respect fragrances from the start and knows a great deal about them not only from trying so many but also because she is a lavender farmer and oil distiller. \nI have a crappy genetic disease that wreaks havoc on my not yet middle aged body and most recently have endured nine hip surgeries in 2 years. Because of my immobility, my once never weight troubled body has gained 40 pounds. My mom has stood by me through everything I've dealt with and encourages me, shows me the bright side of life and inspires me to be my best each and every day. On a recent visit to my house (she sadly lives two states away) she bought this magnificent Coco Mademoiselle. We both agreed that it was so meant for her, it's almost like she was born smelling this way naturally! \nWell, a month later, I joined weight watchers (ugh) which happens to be right next door to Sephora. I visited the WW office for the first time on Monday when there was no meeting going on just to get my feet wet. I've dreaded actually going to a meeting. Afterwards, I went to Sephora, of course, and when I spritzed this exquisite fragrance on a card, it literally took my breath away, in a good way! It was as if my mother was standing there with me. Of course I asked for a sample to take home and treasure. \nBut I did one better than that! I made myself a deal that if I forced myself to attend a WW meeting, I could treat myself to a small bottle of this heavenly scent. Today, I DID IT! I went to a meeting, learned I've already lost seven pounds AND I walked right out, with a huge smile on my face and bought this, my mothers scent in a bottle! I have no regrets and never will. It is so richly concocted. It is fresh and vibrant, elegant yet wearable. For me, it's such a win because it works with my skin (perhaps it's an \"Apple doesn't fall far from the tree\" thing, lol!) yet it is slightly different than on my mom. But, a beautiful scent so many around me love and an across the distance hug from my dear mother. I couldn't ask for more. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f [Now I just have to keep this fume reward thing from becoming a habit with each weight loss victory.....or do I??? ;-)]", "2": "People can say \u201dit\u2019s nothing special\u201d.

Flat out delicious.\n\nI used to wear this religiously, my daily routine for work, but as time went on I started smelling this in the air in public places and realized how common it had become.\n\nThis is a new classic, for sure.

It\u2019s truly special. So here\u2019s the thing\u2026 years ago (10 maybe?) I worked in an office with a girl who positively BATHED in this fragrance. It was so overpowering that it became nauseating for me smelling it all day every day on her, so I just had it in my head that I hated Coco Mademoiselle. Cut to 10 years later I randomly decide to spray a sample on myself (two sprays max) and I am floored. Unlike others, I like the dry down so much more than the opening which I find slightly sharp, but still beautiful. The dry down is the warmest, yet cleanest patchouli And is probably the best thing I have ever smelled. I want to smell like this always. As for it being popular and over played, well when something is this good, there is a reason and I actually don\u2019t care.", "8": "Chanel Coco and Coco Mademoiselle are the only two fragrances that have ever scared me. I eventually got over my fear of Coco being too feminine and was greatly rewarded. However, Coco Mademoiselle proved to be far more difficult. If only I knew that this was all in my mind...\n\nThis was the signature fragrance of a friend that I had an intense fling with(we're still friends).. Every time we'd get together, I'd go insane over Coco Mademoiselle on her skin. So when it was finally time to test the rest of the Chanel line, this one scared me senseless. \n\nHOWEVER\nOnce I finally got the courage to test it, something was different. The patchouli was stronger, the mimosa was toned down, the citrus notes were amplified with the rose. Skin chemistry is a powerful thing. I thought to myself, \"Damn.. I can actually pull this off!!\" I was still worried about what people would think, though. So how would I get over THIS obstacle? Well, all of the co-workers in my section are guys. If Coco Mademoiselle was feminine on my skin, they'd be sure to let me know it.\n\nGuess what? All I got was, \"Hey, that's pretty fresh, man. What is that?\" I wouldn't tell them because guys aren't good with those types of surprises like women are. All day, I caught whiffs of this and it kept making me smile. I felt upbeat, vibrant and refreshed all day. The sillage is between moderate/conservative on my skin. But the longevity is KILLER!!! It's been 12 hours since I sprayed this on my forearms and it's still noticeable. \n\nTo hell with the criticism and the popularity. This is worth the hype. I own this AND Coco, loving them both.", "9": "Sparkling pink champagne spiked with juicy mandarin orange... A rose gold pendant with diamonds coming to life in the sunshine... a sheer, glittering iridescent rosy curtain that opens to reveal a stunningly beautiful woman...\nFirst spritz is all about the top notes listed- mandarin, rose & patchouli become one entity, as described above. My attention is secured, in a nose-glued-to-wrist kind of way. \n\nHaving gone to the department store and so purposefully handed over $130 for the large bottle of this (judging by the salesperson's response of \"REALLY???\", this doesn't happen often in Lower Alabama)... I meant to take in this whole experience, never missing a single nuance.\n\nThe introduction is intense and long-lived... celebratory, as if the woman is being welcomed back to the stage after a long hiatus by a standing ovation of admirers. They even rush to the front to offer her giant bouquets of roses.\n\nWhen the clamor dies down, we are ready to hear her sing, and this is when we are reminded that, beneath all of her physical beauty and the opulence that surrounds her is a warm soul... and a woman who sings that soul.\n\nThe heart of Coco Mad brings the warmth... the sweet citrus settles and becomes a warm, vibrating feeling. I imagine this to be a collaboration of bergamot & vetiver, working with the ever-present fresh patchouli to enliven the creamy concoction of orange flower, vanilla and tonka.\n\nThis is when we hear her song. It is something hearfelt, a classic that has been heard a million times, but is loved just as dearly each time... a feel-good selection, one that is a safe choice in that it will always be well-received, but no less moving for that fact- \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\", maybe? It has been around since the dawn of time, but still has the power to bring even modern-day teenagers to tears... something like that. \n\nShe takes her time, too- this is no show to rush. The heart of Coco Mad sings and sparkles and vibrates for hours before beginning to rest. That's it, actually... she does not \"fade\", she merely \"rests\"... on a satiny bed of musk and resin.\n\nWhat a privilege to behold this gorgeous classic bottle of rose gold on my perfume display. I am not a woman to whom $130 comes easily, not for perfume, anyway... I was compelled by a force bigger than me. :)", "10": "I\u2019ve clearly been living under a rock and need help! Despite being a perfume fiend and living in a huge city, I had honestly never sniffed this until a few weeks ago. Seriously.\n\nI\u2019d heard of Coco Mad, obviously. But it was always mentioned in a slightly derogatory way (\u2018Oh, I I used to wear it all the time, but then I discovered REAL perfume\u2019 etc...I\u2019ve obviously been hanging out with hardcore perfumistas for far too long! ). So, not being a big Chanel fan, I overlooked this for years. \n\nThen my aunty turned up for dinner one evening a few weeks back smelling like heaven and I had to know what the hell she was wearing! I got the loveliest fresh, clean aura (the citrus and rose), undercut with a dreamy sweetness (vanilla) and earthy femininity (the patch!). It was utterly delightful...and I went straight out that weekend and bought myself 30mls.\n\nHaving worn it regularly for a couple of weeks now, I can safely say this is a strong, strong like and a must have for my wardrobe. It\u2019s just such a fantastic workhorse! A great all-rounder that I\u2019ve worn happily in a range of settings and it\u2019s consistently felt just right. \n\nUbiquitous, so they say. Common, even. But I couldn\u2019t care less. It\u2019s a new beauty to me and I\u2019ll be wearing this regularly from now on.", "11": "I really love this fragrance but do not get that it is only for young women.

By the way, I'm 63 years old...", "12": "To me, this smells like an early spring day in Paris - youthful but chic, fresh yet classic, blossoms in the air and crisp white wine at dinner. It is also unmistakably Chanel.I won't go into the individual notes as I don't believe they are really that distinguishable, and the whole scent is so much more than the sum of its parts. \n\nI have just finished a 100ml bottle of CM EDP that I was given 10 (!) years ago by an ex boyfriend. By keeping it in the box and away from sunshine it has stayed perfect throughout those years. I'm very sad to have finished the bottle as this scent has been the defining scent of my twenties. I'm unsure now whether to repurchase or try something different as I head into my 30s, so strong is the association of this scent with my growing up. That is not to say that this wouldn't suit older wearers - I do think it is truly an ageless scent.\n\nYes, it is very popular and therefore ubiquitous, but I think it is for good reason. It stands up extremely well against the sea of vanilla that characterizes modern mass fragrance. \n\nA modern classic.", "13": "What I love about \"Coco Mademoiselle\" is that it will never smell dated. It doesn't smell trendy, either. It simply smells classic French.\n\nThe secret?\nWhen Jacques Polge (the perfumer) created \"Coco Mademoiselle\" in the early-2000s, he did not follow any fragrance trends of that time, which is the reason why the perfume is timeless: it can't be \"trapped\" in a period. It smelled amazing in 2001, still smells amazing in 2022, and will smell amazing by the end of this century. Since its inception, \"Coco Mademoiselle\" never once fell off the international bestsellers list.\n\nOn to the scent!\n\"Coco Mademoiselle\" opens with a spicy-citrus (think pomander balls), but the Grasse jasmine, Turkish rose, and velvety orange blossom quickly enter, adding elegance to the bright opening. The scent is then rounded out on a base vanilla, patchouli, and precious woods. The result? An intoxicating and elegant perfume that some may find intimidating.\n\nLike I said, the perfume is timeless because no trendy or \"hyped up\" fragrance notes were used. While the other brands were chasing perfume trends, the Chanel house was more interested in creating something that would fit in with the brand image. Traditional perfume notes were used, blended with expertise using classic French perfumery techniques.\n\nLasting power (for the Eau De Parfum) is about six hours for me, when it's a new bottle. After a year or two, the perfume grows richer and bolder as it ages, and lasts days. Yes, days.\n\n\"Coco Mademoiselle\" is confident, luxurious, and beautiful. Something about the perfume makes it a cut above others. Love it or hate it, it is the scent of this century; the zeitgeist, if you will. The 20th had \"No. 5,\" the 21st has \"Coco Mademoiselle.\"", "14": "I only really got into perfumes about two months ago, and was very much at the stage of testing and sampling and blind buying, not really committed to anything in particular. A friend of mine mentioned how the Chloe EDP was her signature scent and I remember being boggled at how restrictive an idea that seemed: why would I just want to wear one perfume when there was a veritable world to choose from out there? At this point I'd already had Dior Hypnotic Poison, Ivoire by Balmain and L'Instant de Guerlain (EDT). I loved Hypnotic Poison and L'Instant (and still do!) but the idea of only wearing one scent and in fact choosing to only wear one scent was still quite inconceivable to me. But one day I was out window shopping with a friend and we saw a Chanel perfume counter. I was planning to get the Chanel Coco EDP sight unseen but then I laid eyes on Coco Mademoiselle and I knew then and there that I had to have it. I'd smelt it off the bottle before but this time I sprayed it on my arm and immediately fell in love with it. I bought a massive bottle on the spot.\n\nSince then, I've bought a few more Chanels and a back-up of my beloved L'Instant but Coco Mademoiselle remains my absolute favourite. I don't know much about notes and such and don't pretend to, but to me, it opens with a delightful, rounded citrus scent which quickly mellows into authentic, unsullied rose. This in turn transforms into what to me is a subtle, almost black tea-scent. I love love love Coco Mademoiselle and fully intend to purchase the 200ml soon (I have the 100ml now). Tonight, this new year's eve, I shall wait for everyone to go to bed and I shall then close the doors of my bedroom and spray myself lavishly with this perfume before I inevitably doze off after what has been a very trying year indeed. I cannot imagine a more perfect (or anti-social!) way to see off this year and welcome the next. Happy new year, all!", "15": "Too expensive but, hands down, the best fragrance I have ever had the pleasure to smell. I tried the whole store, I am not a perfumes person, but I am completely in love with this fragrance and I know it is going to be my signature smell as soon as I get paid this month. Briliant. Worth the money and the hype. So in love...", "16": "Who's to say who doesn't deserve to wear a certain perfume? If Chanel only wanted special people to wear Coco Mademoiselle, they wouldn't sell it in shops, only in exclusive circles or clubs with these special people. It's only another perfume. Everyone who can afford it deserves to wear it, no matter who they are, how old or young they are and how they are dressed. Life's to short to be picky about it. Coco M is a girly perfume, so why can't young girls wear it. It's perfect for them. Coco M is Cocos younger sister. :-) \n\nHow should a person wear Coco M to be worthy of it?\nI love Coco M. If I want to smell it when I'm out picking mushroom, I wear it. I own a bottle and do what I want with it.", "17": "I\u2019ve gotta say, I adore this perfume. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s basic or if a lot of other people have it. (Most people don\u2019t know perfumes, they just know if something smells good, so who cares?)  \nThe floral, citrus, and patchouli just does it for me. Plus the projection and performance are pretty good.  \nI sprayed myself at 10am, and at 2pm a receptionist at my doctor\u2019s office, who was wearing a mask, told me how great I smelled. \nTwo hours later my neighbor made the same comment as we talked in her driveway. \nThis one is being added to my collection.", "18": "Coco Mademoiselle smells like cashmere wool, like freshly glossed and trimmed hair, like mimosas at brunch with old friends. Fizzy champagne and fresh orange juice with depth. \n\nIt smells like someone who has their sh*t together, or just pretends like they do. There\u2019s something about the scent that makes me feel just a little bit more chic and a lot more put together. \n\nMany perfumes disappear on my skin within hours, only leaving slightly sweet wafts coming up from my scarves. Coco Mademoiselle will last me a solid two days if I don\u2019t shower, and I still smell traces of it on unwashed sheets days later. Two spritzes in the air, a waltz through, and I\u2019m good to go. I typically only have that kind of longevity with Mugler.  \n\nThere are definitely similarities between this and Coco Noir. Same with Chance. I think I still prefer this one. \n\nOh, and hubs loves it.

Too bad it's a victim of its own success and you still smell it everywhere 20 years after its release, however it had stood the test of time and you will never commit a \"faux pas\" wearing Coco Mademoiselle.\n\nLongevity is monstrous, I still smell it clearly on my skin one day after, sillage is very good too, fills up the room!

The thing was that she usually owersprayed (like 5- 6 times before she went out)..a lot of people were complaining about her, the room was always \"full of her\" and many women got headache...I never got headache , but to be honest, I didn\u00b4t like it...even my mother said : it\u00b4s like a cheap spray for toilette...\nBut THEN ,after some years, something strange happened.\nMy boyfriend knows I am addicted to perfumes...he worked in Provence for some weeks and he brought me this from France as a present (even though he used to tell me : I will never give you any perfume, I love your natural smell !!!:))\nI was very surprised, cause I remembered this perfume as a very strong one and he always loved soft ones on me...so I asked : did you smell it before you bought it? or you bought it just because of a nice bottle ? :)\nAnd he said that ofcousre he smelled it...that it reminded him of me and that he considers it very sophisticated mature but still \"mademoiselle\" fragrance even great for summer and spring days!!! very nice floral and a bit spicy piece...\nI was so suprised, so I gave one spritz on me and told him that maybe he should have waited...I knew it would change after 20 minutes on my skin...and really after 15 minutes it changed, but he still liked it...after one hour he adored it...and then I realised...I loved it too! It\u00b4s all about amount...with this perfume you cannot overspray yourself...just use it gently...and then your skin will play with it...only those women who allow also the skin to speak, will have an original cloud behind them :) cause when you overspray, it always smells the same and can be annoying...but when it\u00b4s 2 sprays, it\u00b4s exactly the right amount to feel it, but to feel also your skin...I use also one nice chypre cream before I spray the perfume..that melange fits perfectly together :)\nEnjoy this luxurious fragrance...:) with a good amount:)", "23": "Nothing left unsaid about this perfume.

In fact, there are many firsts associated with Coco Mademoiselle. It was my first year in college, my first college friend, and our first night out downtown. We decided to congratulate ourselves on our commencement at university and booked a table at a posh restaurant in the city. Getting ready to go out, I sneaked into my mother's closet like a 5 year old girl up to no good and gently sprayed the contents of the coveted flacon onto my decolletage. From that moment, that night has been forever etched into my memory. It completely transformed me from a lowly college student into an elegant woman waiting for her friend at a dim lit downtown restaurant. It affected everything I did that night, from my posture to my tone of voice to the way I walked. I had become an elegant and refined lady. \nSubsequently, the more often I wore it, the more I got used to it and became myself again. Nevertheless, every time I spray it, I remember that night and the elegance I associated with this perfume. \nIt is the perfect fragrance. So very versatile - oriental but fresh - it is appropriate for daytime as well as evening and is universally pleasant. Also, it ALWAYS brings in compliments from men.", "25": "The story behind by coco mademoiselle purchase is one I had never shared before. It was a day in late June with my head thick with many challenging thoughts. I had been on a recent dating spree determined to be strong and \"get myself out there\" after a hard breakup I had experienced. Ironically the only guy I did have feelings for made me so nervous I kept trying to push him away.\nIt was then at work that it dawned on me that I was only running away from my problems and feelings, no strength in that.\nOn my break from work I somehow found myself standing in front of coco mademoiselle, totally allured by it's upfront, classy, and definitive scent. I bought it right then and sprayed some on. I felt inspired so I texted all the guys I had been dating. I was done and was ready to start truly being strong. I regret nothing.\n\nIt may just have been my experience by coco mademoiselle to me is a powerful & ladylike scent. Coco Mad is a woman of class, poise, and tenderness. If she were a real person I'm sure she would always get her way with charm and a coy smile.\nThe opening starts with a very citrusy, slightly soapy floral, and sexy musky skin sort of ballad. I don't think this is a comparison Coco Mad get's a lot but to me it smells beachy. Like Coco Mad is in her cute polka dot bathing suit at the beach, reclined in her chair, with a cigarette in her mouth.\nThe dry down of the scent smells like soapy aldehydes, lady like florals, sexy skin musk, bites of patchouli, warm tonka bean, french attitude, and smoked vanilla.\nIncredibly popular at no surprise this perfume truly represents Chanel quality and lasts all day. A bottle in my wardrobe I always feel proud to have and worth every dang penny.", "26": "This is my first review of a women's scent, well, sorta.\nI'm a man and have been into fragrances since 2009.\n\nI can't tell you about its individual notes, it's longevity, projection or its nuances.\n\nI can tell you though that within the last few years of my growing interest in scents has given me the nerve/motivation to ask women what perfume they are wearing.\n\nOn two or three occasions I have been so enthralled by a particular fragrance that I had no hesitation in asking what they were wearing.\n\nThose memorable moments the ladies have answered Coco's Mademoiselle!\n\nGreat attention getter.", "27": "A long time ago, I used to hate Chanel fragrances...\nNo5 was too stuffy and old-lady like, No19 was too bitter, Coco was too much... So I never went near them and bought Guerlain, Dior, Calvin Klein...\nCoco Mademoiselle got the same fate. When it first came out, I picked it up from a department store counter, just removed the cap and had a quick sniff... like every other one, I hated it, too bitter, \"that\" Chanel note again. However, and I still don't know why (well probably to see what the fuss was about I guess), a while after that I went back and tested it on my wrist. Got the same initial reaction, but of course, after a short while, I started smelling the most beautiful, heavenly scent. And from that moment, I was hooked. This is probably the perfume that I have bought the most. It is definitely my signature scent, and my only regret is that it is worn by so many women.\nOn me it is mainly the orange blossom and the patchouli (which I adore). My bathroom cabinet smells heavily of it just because of th half empty bottle i still have... But more importantly, this has taught me to love the Chanel fragrances: Allure, Allure Sensuelle, now I have also moved on to the proper Coco, and I am learning to apprecaite No5 which I got as a present... There is no going back, I am definitely hooked on Chanel, and I will always have some Coco Mademoiselle.", "28": "I initially bought this to wear in the summer heat, as I live in Australia and my former signature scent, Armani Si, was a bit too cloying in 40C weather. I chose Coco Mademoiselle as it's a fruitchouli with a prominent woody facet, like Armani Si, but with a lighter, more citrus opening that I thought may be more suitable for hot weather.\n\nI didn't expect to love this as much as I did. Especially because, like many people into fragrance, I crave uniqueness and would loathe to share my fragrance with someone else, as immature as that may seem. And Coco Mademoiselle is infamous for being very popular!\n\nBut there's a reason it's a bestseller. I have reluctantly accepted it as my signature scent. It opens with a mildly sweet, soapy orange scent, giving the impression of a well groomed woman. The heart is a honeyed rose and jasmine, toyed with so it doesn't become too smothering. The base strikes me as somewhat masculine, consisting of very bitter patchouli contrasted with sweet haylike vetiver (coumarin?), and just a little bit of vanilla and resins. The base was the most challenging part of Coco Mademoiselle for me, in contrast to it's traditionally feminine, sweet and light top notes, but I eventually came to love it. I think the contrast between the feminine and masculine notes in the perfume give it it's character and charm.\n\n10/10 would recommend.", "29": "I got a sample of this cause there's a lot of hype around it. And I wore it a couple of times during the spring (people have also voted it to be a spring scent here). But I wasn't very fond of it - it wasn't anything special, more like okay and nice to have. But now as it's summertime - I decided to try this again. And WOW - I was definitely not expecting that. It's like it changes its character completely with warmer weather. It just came alive and went from boring to absolutely gorgeous. I was blown away.\nAnd for that reason I think this is a hot summerday scent.\n\nI'm typically not a big fan of patchouli but the way it ties this perfume together is amazing. It is a very very juicy scent - I get lots of sweet oranges(without their sourness) with a beautiful touch of rose. And the way vanilla and tonka beans and jasmine are just lurking around is just perfection. \n\nAbsolutely wonderful and totally non-boring to wear to the office on summer days.", "30": "I love Chanel perfumes and this one I bought because it is light enough for me to wear during the Summer months, I save No. 5 and Coco for the cooler months. This is an elegant perfume and I always get a ton of compliments when I wear it. Chanel perfume has great longevity and silleage but this is never overpowering...it's sophisticated and perfect choice for any age (teens to mature adult)Don't be afraid to buy this, you will not regret it. I wear it anytime I want to feel pretty.", "31": "This is a crowd pleaser fragrance. Bitter orange and patchouli, I don't get any rose. The dry down is a soft vanilla.\nThey say everyone wears this but I don't know anyone who does, it's a pretty scent that isn't overpowering or heavy.\nIt's heavy on orange and bergamot but it somehow doesn't scream 'citrus' as a perfume. Restrained and elegant. Definitely a safe blind buy.", "32": "God, this is a modern classic, and it SO deserves its platform!\n\nThe opening is intoxicating, and is the greatest citrus top note combination I've ever come across.\nI have a love / hate relationship with citrus. Sometimes it's God-awful in-your-face. In this case, it's head-turning, joyous, and DAMN CLASSY.\n\nI've been obsessed with this scent since I first got a sample. I recently had a little extra cash recently and bought my own bottle - My perfume collection had a \"CM\"-shaped hole in it.\n\nThe middle notes have a delightful, understated floral scent. That classiness and elegance lingers gently in the air.\n\nThe base notes are a perfect blend of subtle longevity. The tonka bean and vanilla allows to remain beautifully sweet. The patchouli and white musk ensures the intoxication continues.\n\nThe sillage is enchanting, and the longevity is awesome.\n\nThis is the perfect all-rounder:\nAll seasons.\nAll hours.\n\nI'm so happy.\n\n***\n\nKitty rating: 10/10! <3\n\n~Compliment Counter~: 2 compliments \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "33": "Ugh the only problem with this one is that we ALL love it! Lol", "34": "I just gotta add to my first review lol. This really is the ultimate fragrance. Clean, fresh white florals, with a hint of citrus and minty patchouli. I just bought it a few weeks ago and I've already gotten more compliments/comments than I ever have on all of my 70+ designer, high end perfumes. And I always spray A LOT of my other perfumes lol (5+ sprays for every perfume I use, sometimes way more). I really don't think it's annoying that it's so popular. I think it's cool and I love it when other people compliment it and it's a conversation starter. It was on my want list for many, many years and I finally bit the bullet and bought it and it was so worth the $$$$. Chanel Chance EDT has been my signature perfume and absolute FAVE but this one is definitely taking its place!! It's way more noticeable, better sillage, more chic smelling and lasts longer than both the Chance EDT and EDP. It just has this sophisticated, chic feel that makes you feel confident and put together. You could be wearing jeans and a t and this perfume just glams it up.", "35": "Man who wears this perfume here.\n\n\nPersonally, I see this as a unisex fragrance just like most Chanel\u2019s. Definitely requires a certain confidence to pull off a \u201cfemale\u201d fragrance, although I don\u2019t think fragrances have gender. The patchouli is quite noticeable in this scent, which I love \u2014 it\u2019s not as noticeable as it is in Mademoiselle Intense, but if you are sensitive to patchouli then this will be polarizing for you.\n\nIt is very warm, but I could see this being worn all year around and do so myself. I always get compliments on this, and am asked \u2018what cologne are you wearing?\u2019 hence why I think it easily works for men. I love it, and what I love especially about it is it is good for layering. My favorite combinations include layering Mademoiselle with By The Fireplace or Eau Fraiche which doubles down on the patchouli and makes it a sparkling green fragrance. All in all? 10/10 for me. Reminds me of when I first graduated high school.", "36": "Dear all, \nYou must remember that it depends a lot which Coco Mademoiselle you've been trying and what amount. You have to remember the quantity of raw materials in Chanel fragrances and always choose the right version of the fragrance. For them who judge Coco Mademoiselle as a too heavy, you should have tried the EdT. And second, Chanel doesn't \"have to remind you to be sexy\" because women who choose to wear Chanel are independent, sophisticated, brave and outgoing. Just like Coco herself was. There fore you can truly only wear a Chanel fragrance when you're deeply in love with the brand and it's history. I believe Chanel is a way of life and wearing Chanel fragrance, accessories or fashion, you are your own life's Gabrielle Chanel. To me she's an inspiration and that's why I love and like each and every Chanel fragrance, even those are not all for me to wear.", "37": "This is hands down my holy grail of fragrance. I always return to this one and it feels like home . It\u2019s popular for a reason and I\u2019m ok with that . Fan since 2001 . Never found another that lives up to this one . Timeless.", "38": "This perfume I have been reluctant to review even though it is a regular part of my rotation. I have so much to say. I struggle to find the right words. I want to do Mademoiselle justice. \nShe is a Chanel. She is sophisticated yet casual. She has class yet is modern and au courrant. There aren't very many places she can't go. But at the same time, she isn't for everybody. She chooses you I think (just like others from the Chanel family...No. 5 and Coco). \nI am in my early 30s and I cannot say I have had a lot of experience with Coco Mademoiselle up until recently despite it's apparent popularity. I thought I had never smelled it. Until I smelled it, I didn't realize I had smelled it before. There is a girl in my office who I am pretty sure douses herself with it, you can smell her coming from a mile away and it is repulsive on her. Usually when that happens the perfume is ruined for everyone around forever...but not with this one. \nWhen I smelled it on myself I felt that this is definitely special, definitely could understand why it is so well loved. It is soft, rich, sweet, complex, but lovely...just a tad musky too (which is why I cannot wear it everyday after a while the muskiness builds up?).I am complimented steadily when I wear this by both men and women. It makes me feel just a little more in tune with myself when I wear it. \nI have smelled it on others and it will smell different on them. This one must be very particular to body chemistry and also formulation. The edp is creamier and I can detect the base notes more. The edt is crisper and the top notes are more prominent. I personally would love to have the parfum as well. We shall see what the future holds.\nBut overall, as much as I want to be unique and guard all my secrets. I do encourage everyone to smell and test this one for themselves...must try...love it or hate it...a definite Modern Classic.", "39": "Beautifully soft, fragrant heaven in a bottle! I get whiffs of bergamot and orange top notes over a primarily rosey heart that takes her time to get down to a gorgeous vanillic-opponax and patchouli base. Mass marketed? Yes, but I understand why. This juice is lovely and melds perfectly with my body chemistry to result in a sweet, soft sensualness that I received loads of compliments on. I haven't had the privilege of sampling the L'extrait or the Parfum (oil) but I imagine they're just as stunning as this gem, if not more so. <3", "40": "The first bottle I ever owned of Coco Mademoiselle, was a gift from my husband and I was mesmerized at first sniff. Powdery, flowery, patchouli-citrus infused goodness. Very Chanel but more my style than the original Coco or No 5, which I can only admire from afar; unfortunately they don't mix well with my skin chemistry. This one was pure perfection though. I tested it out at a duty-free shop on a cruise and later on, my husband surprised me with it as a gift. I had this bottle for years and recently ran out...\nI went to Macy's to repurchase and didn't test it since I've been wearing it for years, but maybe I should have because something is different. The smell is still gorgeous but the sillage and longevity have been cut in half. \nNow, please take note, I am not one to go around bashing all of the reformulations out there. A few of my beloved Guerlains and Diors have also been reformulated and I have not left negative feedback. This one breaks my heart though. This perfume was always very special to me and it was one of the few citrus/floral/patchouli scents (which I love) that had amazing sillage and longevity. Those types of scents are usually soft and fleeting on my skin but this was an exception. It was something I could wear any time, for any occasion and I didn't have to worry about it wearing off. \nThe scent is still the same beauty it was years ago, but I am not pleased with the reformulation. Please don't hate me; I am just being completely honest in my findings. I expected better from Chanel. This scent was very special to me; I wore it on my wedding day so it will always hold a very special place in my heart.", "41": "This is my signature scent, and it basically ruined all other scents for me. I still want to know them/own them, but they are not getting much wear, because everytime I want to smell great and feel good my hand reaches for Coco Mademoiselle. I got my first bottle 10 years ago and I still adore it, it still delights me. I don't even know why - it just wears great, it's never tiring, never boring, it's perfect for every weather, day and night, and I love it that my hair smells Coco Mademoiselle when I wake up in the morning after a great day and adventures of the night. The fresh and pleasant smell that I can still feel in the morning makes me happy. I also love the bath & body products from CM's line - especially the shower gel and fresh moisture mist.", "42": "Yes this is a very popular perfume from girls and women in their teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, etc and guess what? There is nothing wrong with that! It's a lovely, ultra posh, feminine scent so no wonder why its so beloved by many. Classics wouldnt be classics if nobody loved them at some point or another. \n\nMademoiselle is Bright yet warm. A bit soapy on me. Citrusy welcome followed by a slight spiciness im guessing from the patchoulli, sweet witout being too sweet, lots of white florals and rose, vanilla and tonka in the end. \n\nsome words that come to mind:Lady, woman, feminine, elegant, happy, expensive, shiny, jewlery, heels or nice ballerinas, sunglasses, red fingernails, mimosas, the colors light pink, white and beige, harmony...\n\nWhen i want to feel like an elegant lady regardless of the season and my age, without smelling too sweet, or too spicy, too masculine, to fresh, or too floral, there is this.

But the question with perfume shouldn't be who is or isn't wearing it, it should be: how does it smell?  If you like bright, juicy orange/citrus and patchouli, then this is a great scent, especially in its sparkly early stages. It does go though a distinctly cologne-y phase that some here have likened (not unfairly) to aftershave, and I don't like that phase as much as the opening. \n\nThis scent can be ruined by overspraying because it has a lot of sillage-that patchouli sure can throw!- which definitely could contribute to people resenting this scent, as I imagine it could be lethal on a heavy-handed teenager or smoker. It also tends to linger-on hair, clothes, furniture. But applied sparingly, I can see why this is so beloved. \n\nAnd the bottle-especially the smaller edp- is great.", "45": "Chanel Coco Mademoiselle EDP opens with a moderate to a strong projection of citrus, floral, fruity, and musky notes. The opening is fresh, elegant, sporty, versatile, unique, intense, and very pleasant. The bergamot, orange, mandarin orange, rose, jasmine, and orange blossom are the prominent opening notes. The combination of these notes gives this fragrance its unique touch. The bergamot, orange, and mandarin orange create a sweet, citrusy, and fresh touch; the rose, jasmine, and orange blossom create the initial floral accord; the feminine, sensual, slightly powdery, sweet, and floral dense rose balanced with the sweet, warm white floral, with a citrus touch of the orange blossom and jasmine. The mimosa and ylang-ylang don\u2019t take long before surfacing; both create a yellow floral note that is sweet, creamy, slightly musky, and with a peach-like hint that adds to the delectability of this fragrance. As time passes, the patchouli, white musk, and vanilla grow to become noticeable. The patchouli in this fragrance is fresh and green; however, it isn\u2019t classy or old-school. The white musk surfaces with great intensity, and it becomes the projecting accord; the white musk in this fragrance can be described as very clean, projecting, airy, dry, enveloping, mature, but not classy, and fresh musky note. The rest of the notes, including the vanilla, tonka, vetiver, and opoponax, are support notes and sit in the far back of the fragrance. The fragrance has a noticeable progressive opening to dry down transition. The opening is citrusy, red and white floral, intense, sharp; the notes are well defined, very fresh, inviting, and sweet. As time passes, the yellow floral accords of the mimosa and ylang-ylang join, adding a fruity, slightly musky, and peach-like note, the patchouli, and white musk surface. The patchouli adds a very fresh green note; the white musk is enveloping. It changes the fragrance's character to dry, slightly powdery, and it boosts the projection to strong. Once Chanel Coco Mademoiselle EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a strong projection, white musk, floral rose, jasmine, orange blossom, ylang-ylang, green patchouli, citrusy orange, mandarin orange, and bergamot fragrance with faint resinous accords. The fragrance feels airy, bold, calming, casual, clean, commanding, delectable, delicate, dense, dry, elegant, energizing, exotic, expensive, exquisite, feminine, floral, formal, fresh, green, high-quality, imposing, intense, intimate, inviting, long-lasting, mature, modern, musky, nicely-blended, persistent, playful, powdery, professional, refined, refreshing, rich, romantic, seductive, sophisticated, sporty, sweet, versatile, white, and very pleasant.\n\nBATCH REVIEWED: 2019 (#3301).\nWOW RATING: 10/10.

No.5 my first love, smelled like the lady I wanted to grow up to be. It was sophisticated and classy but it was a mature scent and i wore it like an oversize pair of heels. A great time passed before I found the exquisite Coco Mademoiselle. The first whiff will grab your attention with a full 'presence' that only Chanel perfumes seem to possess. I'll describe the initial impression as enchantment, liberation and good old-fashioned charm. Afterwards, there is a sexy tenderness that melts your heart. So while No.5 initially set my dreams alight...

I own Bois des Iles which is ethereal and of course, No. 5 which I feel should be in everyone's collection.  Coco?  I am so surprised younger people do not like it.  It does smell of the late 90's early 2000's, with its fruity opening, floral mids, and patchouli base. With that said, however, I don't think it smells dated. I think it smells like a fresh fruity, floral bouquet but with a touch of sophistication only Chanel scents could pull off.  \n\nI like it a lot.  It could be a nice daily fragrance, not offensive (spray lightly) with arms-length projection and decent sillage. It's long-lasting too.  One spray and I am good for the day.", "48": "I smelled this a long time ago and only a while back I found out that it's Coco Mademoiselle. I remember telling myself: \"THIS is it. Your search for the perfect perfume is OVER.\" Thus far, it remains true. Coco Mademoiselle really lives up to the hype, and for all the good reasons.\n\nThis hands down is the most beautiful perfume I've ever known. It's a total signature scent material and an absolute all-rounder, with excellent points all over. The smell is feminine, sweet and yet fresh, without getting too cloying: they are all balanced very beautifully. I always have high expectations for Chanel perfumes, and Coco Mademoiselle certainly hits all the right spots. From opening to the very last whiff, Coco Mademoiselle never lets you down. It opens with a very bright note which only gets better as the middle and base notes shine through. In fact, the residual scent left after a few days still smells wonderful, albeit more sweetish. It's a perfume you'll fall in love with over and over again. Each time I smell Coco Mademoiselle I feel like I'm going back in time, telling myself the same exact words that this definitely is the perfect little one. The only downside? You seriously need to splurge to get a bottle of this magic.\n\nCoco Mademoiselle puts the extra notch in any mademoiselle who wants to feel flirty and feminine yet at the same time classy. You'll never have to worry about smelling cheap when you have Mademoiselle on: no matter which season and which clothes, it just works (at least for me!) Maybe I'm just crazy about this perfume, but it's just too good that if I had to choose just one perfume to live with for the rest of my life, this would definitely be it :)\n\nRating: 9.5/10", "49": "Wouldn't it be nice if people didn't categorize scents into age groups? \n\nI absolutely adore this scent, and, wait for it - I'm 32!!!\n\nI won't go into the notes, because it's been done time and again.

Like a love child of Kilian Dark Lord and La Nuit de L'Homme. \n- The raspberry in TL fades in about 10 mins. Leaving a leathery smell with crackling spicy saffron. OL pushes the leather back and patchouli emerges resembling another Tom Ford fragrance, Patchouli Absolu. \n- TL dries down to a dry leather with some lingering faint sweetness. OL dries down to a creamy jasmine and cardamom combo, which is darkened with the lingering leather. Call me crazy but the jasmine note slightly reminds me of Baccarat Rouge 540. \nVerdict: If you're a leather lover, get both.  \nIf you have to choose between one, TL is a leather based oriental with tart sweetness while OL is a fresh spicy floral with background leather.  \nChoose according to your own taste. I personally prefer Ombre Leather.", "1": "Tom Ford Ombre Leather opens with a moderate projection of a very natural tone of leather; the leather is by far the most prominent note. The type of leather note found in Ombre Leather isn\u2019t animalic, isn\u2019t synthetic, and isn\u2019t dark; this leather feels completely natural, possibly one of the best and most authentic and wearable leather notes in perfumery. The cardamom note described as an opening note is barely noticeable; however, the jasmine seems to add a soft floral touch that goes well with the leather, same as the amber, both notes enhance the main leather note. The patchouli which typically adds a green tone is absent; finally, the moss, adds a very soft earthy/musky tone. Tom Ford Ombre Leather achieves a fantastic combination of notes where each one of them seems to contribute to the featured note, the leather. The initial and dry-down projections are very good and the transition from the opening to the dry-down is linear. Once Tom Ford Ombre Leather has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, modern and natural leather fragrance with faint floral and ambery tones. The fragrance feels aromatic, bold but not pungent, dry, elegant, exotic, expensive, formal, high-quality, leathery, masculine, mature, modern, natural, nicely-blended, playful, refined, sophisticated, versatile, and very pleasant. \nBATCH REVIEWED: 2020\nWOW RATING: 10/10.

When I fall for a Tom Ford scent, I don\u2019t just have to love the fragrance itself, but I have to overcome that initial resistance to the brand too. Unfair, probably, but true nonetheless. \nAnd despite those hurdles, I\u2019ve fallen hard for Ombr\u00e9 Leather. That first spray: a modern, near industrial, leather note, like the interior of a brand-new luxury car. Berries soon emerge to soften its hard edge, and as it dries down, jasmine enters to play a similar softening role. Underneath it all, a mossy patchouli with amber tones, sustaining the fragrance on skin for hours and hours. \nSome have likened Ombr\u00e9 Leather to Tuscan Leather\u2019s younger sibling. I agree with that assessment. But while others have offered that as a point of criticism, for me, it\u2019s a major plus. I\u2019ve always found Tuscan Leather to be too hard, too abrasive, possessing an over-inflated ego with a puffed-up chest. Ombr\u00e9 Leather is just right, confident, but not overly so, alluring, but not too loud. Tuscan Leather clobbers you into submission. With Ombr\u00e9 Leather, others lean in closer of their own volition. It casts a spell around its wearer. It enchants. \nI\u2019ve only fallen harder for one other Tom Ford scent: White Suede. These two pair beautifully, the juxtaposition of light, musky suede contrasting a harder, darker leather. Pure magic and utter delight.", "4": "Tom Ford's Ombre Leather is quite polarizing. My first impressions were simultaneously 'I do not want to smell like this at all' and 'this is an AMAZING high quality leather scent' lol. For reference I'm in my mid 20s so I do think this is a bit too mature, grown up and serious for me personally. But on the other hand as a fragrance-head, I can't help but adore how masterfully Ombre Leather was put together. \nIn the opening you immediately get this strong, sharp, and super realistic leather. It literally smells like an expensive leather jacket or the interior of a luxury car, in the BOLDEST, most intense way possible. It's also quite animalic, which could be a turn-off for some but I think it gives it an unique character, because this isn't supposed to be a safe crowd pleaser, you're making a statement every time you put this on. This also has a warm and spicy vibe to support the leather. Cardamom gives off a slightly exotic touch. Slight earthiness from patchouli and moss in the base. Also slightly smokey. Amber adds to the warmth and that unmistakable expensive and luxurious feel. Ombre Leather is such a masterpiece that just screams class, masculinity, sophistication and confidence.  \nI'm definitely still too young to pull this one off unfortunately, but I will report back in 20 years when I pull up in my Rolls Royce, dressed in all black, clean cut tailored Tom Ford suit after taking care of my business meetings! \nOpening: 9.3/10\nDry down: 9.3/10\nUniqueness: 9.7/10\nVersatility: 7/10\nPresentation: 9.3/10\nSillage: 9/10\nLongevity: 9/10\nSprays: 2-4\nSeason: Winter \nOccasion: Formal, cold weather signature, serious \nOverall Rating: 9.5/10"}, "29": {"0": "It's my first review. It's not due to the power of Naxos. I'm just bored right now. I know, it's long. I'll do better. So I stoped by Scentbar LA to get some summer juice. The nice lady working there gave me a sample of Naxos. I wore a few dabs to a Whole Foods during a warm July day and was leaving a trail of good smells down each aisle but it may have been too potent for the Venice Beach noses. I really liked the blend so I bought a bottle (at Saks, don't tell Luckyscent). I've have been living with it for a week so here is my expert opinion.  \nPresentation: The presentation, if you give a shit about that sorta thing, is A++. It came in a white box labeled Naxos, inside that box was a cooler red, white and green box and inside that box was a dope leather case and beautiful bottle. Note Break Down: You've got the notes list so I won't tell you I found some secret unlisted note. Who cares anyway, it smells f-n amazing. I'm originally from North Carolina (tobacco country) so I can say that the tobacco note is legit and amped up a bit. All the other notes smell realistic and well placed.  \nCompliment Factor: Will it get you compliments? Yup. Will it get you laid (seems to be what some mean by \"compliments\" on here)? Probably not. No cologne alone can do that. Take a shower, be confident, smell good, wear clean pressed clothes and ask questions about the person you're interested in. Or be ridiculously good looking. Even then, I still shower daily. \nOccasions: Whatever works for your MOJO. I would wear it again to run errands, just not mid day in July in LA. I have an office that I sometimes visit. When I do, I might spray one to the chest (I wear a suit) and one on my wrists. No need to choke out the staff. I personally won't spray more than 4 shots when going out on the town but to each their own.  \nValue: Excellent (for some). It's $250 per bottle but it's 3.4 oz. Many designer frags are $100+ for a 1.7 ouncer. That said, if you're living the broke life (no shame, I've been there) then you're better off buying something like Dolce and Gabbna The One EDP on the gray market and using the other $200 on bills, groceries, magic beans, etc.  \nComparisons: I also found a new bottle of Pure Havane 3 weeks ago and bought it to comp the two. My comparison is this. Michael Jordan is an NBA Hall of Fame shooting guard, so is Reggie Miller. Reggie Miller is no Naxos. \nOverall: I don't expect women to chase me down because I'm wearing Naxos. My non fraghead friends don't give three shits that I'm wearing Naxos. I won't wake up a better person because I'm wearing Naxos. But, I'm glad I've got Naxos on the team. It's a Hall of Famer.", "1": "Listen! This! This smells incredible. I love how this fragrance transforms throughout the day, it's invigorating when you first spray it, but it softens as it dries down. By the end of the day it smells like a completely different perfume. It starts with burst of lavender, bergamot and honey, very aromatic and spicy. The opening leans more masculine, but with time, in about an hour mark, Naxos starts shedding its masculine layers revealing soft, sweet feminine face. At the end of the day you will be left with the softest, most creamy tobacco/vanilla aroma. Lavender never goes away but becomes less aromatic and more calming. Head over heels! <3", "2": "This is absolutely divine and the description does not do it justice. This starts out fruity and floral mixed with spices. It also has woods with a touch of rhum. \nAt first the spices are stronger but settle down after a few minutes and fragrance becomes more balanced making it a bit more floral which I like. \nAfter a while you are left with woods, rhum and orange flowers with the spices in the background. Definitely worth a try. \nStrong, long lasting and very good projection.", "3": "To start off, Naxos by Xerjoff really does share obvious similarities with Mugler\u2019s Pure Havane and a fan of that fragrance most certainly should try Naxos.  \nBut the differences are that Xerjoff takes away the well-known Amen DNA in the base of most of Mugler\u2019s flankers, instead integrating a major and very good tonka bean working perfectly in parallel with the sweet, honeyed tobacco and vanilla. It brings a slightly powdery touch as well combined with the honey. The smoothness here is then on a complete different level, it\u2019s so easy on the nostrils, and it's making it perfectly unisex in my opinion. It also has much higher quality in ingredients, which is logical, and adds a subdued yet very important homogeneous mix of lavender and their famous citrus just to make sure the scent manages the \u201ctour de force\u201d of never becoming too loud and overbearing to my nose. This is quite a feat based on the other notes and the strength of the fragrance.  \nXerjoff is not the house I enjoy the most, not one which has many releases I love and find bottle worthy. But Naxos, along with Uden to begin with, is a definite exception. Unchallenging tobacco, tonka bean and vanilla covered by a layer of honey (A blend a lover of P.D.M's Herod or Kilian's Back to Black could really fall for), all that while staying airy, never overwhelming and done in a masterful way.", "4": "FINALLY! Someone is sincere! This stuff isn't strong anymore, but somehow everybody is raving about fantastic performance.. \nXerjoff have reformulated ALL of their fragrances! I have bought alexandria 2 before 2 years, awful performances.  \nCome on, let's delete my comment. Thumbs down everyone.", "5": "FINALLY! Someone is sincere!

I was really juniors because I was not sure I would like the tobacco note but I have now changed my mind! \nThe quality of this perfume is amazing. Two sprays at 9:00 in the morning and my husband smelled me everywhere in the house! It is now 19:00 hours and I can still smell it! \nIt was fresh at start, nad I could feel the tobacco notes, and the honey but not too sweet at all. Now I am left with powdery notes that I love in my skin!!! Do not have the full bottle only a decant but really want to buy it now. First noche high end perfume that I have tried but totally totally in love!!!! If I was to describe it in a word: Elegant!", "7": "This is a 100% must have for every perfume enthusiast. My first day wearing it got 5 compliments and 3 people asked me what cologne was it to buy it. Is in my top 3 most favorite in my collection. This is dangerously good!", "8": "Firstly, Xerjoff Naxos does have slight similarities to Pure Havane by Mugler.\n\nBut to me, Naxos is thicker, heavier, smells much more natural, lasts longer, and more prominent on the gourmand notes like the honey. Naxos also lasts longer than my 2016 Pure Havane.\n\nBoth of them are awesome, but I do like Naxos much better.", "9": "This has got to be the best perfume ever made. I have tried so many perfumes over the years. Fresh scents, gourmand fragrances, oud, amber and what not but nothing comes close to this. Forget what the notes say but this somehow smells like a luxurious bar of soap (probably has something to do with that lavender). Got a 5ml decant and loved it so much that I got a full bottle. The bottle that I got is a newer batch (produced in late 2021) and the performance is stellar. Highly reccomended. This and Kalemat by arabian oud has become my all time favourties.", "10": "I've recently ordered a current formulation of Naxos and this does not smell as strong as previous bottles especially from three years ago or even when it first came out in 2015. \nThe batch code under the bottle is 32021N production date 2021-11-16. It's not worth the $450 suggested retail price tag or even at $220 from online discounters. \nAnd btw I'd like to riutterate what many reviewers have stated, that this does not smell like pure Malt or pure Havane. I have full bottles of both of these in my fragrance collection and I've tried the comparison test of all three on my skin and I do realise that fragrances are subjective but nope, nada. The only similarly of all three is the sweet vanilla.\nNaxos has similarities with vintage men's fragrances from the 1980's like Ted Lapidus Pour Homme and Baleciaga Pour Homme especially in the first 3-4 hours of its longevity.\nYes this is very weak now, a pity for what was once such a great fragrance. \nWhat is wrong with these fragrance brands, do they think we can't notice these things especially at these prices???..", "11": "I adore this, my favorite fall fragrance, it is so well blended. Does it have similarities with Pure Havane? Yes, but PH is, to my nose, much more pungent and, of course, synthetic, while Naxos is creamier, better blended, it has far superior ingredients and it has the fougere touch that makes it absolutely gorgeous. You do not need olfactory training to sense the difference between PH and Naxos in the air, it's like going from sketch to masterpiece.", "12": "Cuban Bumblebee visits south of Europe...\n\nRight off the bat you get the creamy, delicious honey, but nothing cloying or overly sweet. This goes together with lavender and some citruses that take this honey to the shiny, bright and uplifting territory. \n\nThis to me is a happy fragrance, like the flight of a bumblebee going through a field of lavender and citrus trees.\n\nIn the base you have the tobacco, but nothing smokey or burnt, is more like a fresh-cut cherry tobacco that settles all the other notes. To round this up tonka bean and some vanilla amplifies the deliciousness of this juice, not a gourmand one in any case. It's just right.\n\nI find it also very elegant, unisex, better for colder weather and day or night appropriate. Very good performance with a nice not-synthetic smell for one of the cheapest of the Brand. This shows that Momo can deliver a long lasting, nice fragrance without these heavy, harsh, synthetics woods/ouds you may find in some of his offerings.\n\nUniqueness: medium\n\nScent: 8.5/10\n\nPerformance: high\n\nWould I buy it: Yes (Part of my collection=", "13": "You should wear fragrances that you love for yourself, not for the attention and approval of others. But it really is great when both are true, and this juice has done that for me. I was blown away when I first sampled it, but my first reaction was \"this smells too luxurious and rich for me, I'm not sure I can pull it off...\". It was also my first non-designer purchase, and when you're at that stage of your journey then paying \u00a3170 for a fragrance can seem almost embarrassingly excessive. But after running through a decant I did buy it at full retail and and super glad I did. The quality is through the roof, the whole DNA makes me feel so confident and uplifted, and I've got a bunch of compliments on it to boot. My signature fragrance now, and sets the bar for anything else to beat from here on out.", "14": "People comparing this to angels share by kilian has a broken nose. Wth! Some people seems to be drunk when comparing things here..\n\n\nNaxos, a staple! You need this asap! Best xerjoff fragrance ever made!", "15": "Same DNA than Pure Havane but Naxos is less agressive and more refine and elegant. It's a gorgeous fragrance with great longevity and good projection. Hands down my favorite from Xerjoff. A must have for sweet tobacco lovers.\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50.5 out of 5", "16": "This is the Father of Pure Havane in Darth Vader voice.", "17": "I love Naxos to bits.  This is the only fragrance in my collection that smells completely differently each time I wear it , yet stays recognizable. Each note takes turns to shine and take over the composition on different days. Sometimes I smell like cherries and amaretto, sometimes I'm in lavender heaven, sometimes it's all about an aromatic tobacco mixed with honey. Despite these powerful notes, Naxos feels airy and easy to wear, even office friendly. Longevity is truly remarkable- ~7 hours on skin, days on clothes.", "18": "I imagine Jude Law in the Talented Mr. Ripley wearing this as he casually sits at a cafe in his open collared linen suit, skin tan and radiant, while smoking a cigar during a sunny afternoon in the square of a small piazza of an Italian town near the coast.  It\u2019s citrus fresh, backed by a very sweet rounded tobacco base.  It\u2019s signature worthy.", "19": "I was on the search for a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d fragrance after looking at tons of fragrances and their reviews. First of all, tobacco is one of my least favorite notes. Many fragrances with tobacco give me headaches or smell too old school for me. But I went for it, and yes, this is a true masterpiece. This is so well blended that you cannot just claim it as a \u201ctobacco fragrance\u201d because there\u2019s so much more to it. The lavender and honey smell like heaven in this. If you like smooth, sweet, rich fragrances, then this is for you. I\u2019m 21 but when i wear this I feel like a mafia boss.\n\n\nEdit: this is now my signature scent along with Prada L\u2019homme", "20": "Xjeroff Naxos is PERFECTION IN A BOTTLE.  I am a tobacco scent LOVER.  I seek out these types of scents to test and use.  I have older versions of Pure Havane as well and LOVE IT.  Here is my take.  Naxos and Pure Havane are both GREAT tobacco scents.  Naxos is more smooth and rich where Pure Havane is a bit more synthetic and playful (both great scents).  Naxos is much more versatile and can be worn day or night, dressed up and dressed down.  Pure Havane is mostly a nighttime 'party' or 'club' scent.  Please know that while there are similarities with these two fragrances, there are also differences.  Naxos begins with a quick tobacco burst and then goes into what I would describe as a slight medicinal and citrusy path for a bit, don't be put off by the medicinal part, IT WORKS.  The tobacco is ALWAYS lingering and a couple hours in to the scent, the tobacco, tonka and vanilla are MASTERFUL!  Where Pure Havane bursts tobacco onto the scene immediately, Naxos works the tobacco in throughout.  The honey is a nice addition to the fragrance.  Make no mistake about it, Naxos is a TOBACCO scent, it is so so well done and it is down right addicting.  If you like Tobacco scents, do yourself a favor and get it, you will not regret it.   Naxos is never obnoxious in any way and can be worn to work, date, at home, outside, inside (you get the picture).    \n\nRegarding longevity and silage, Naxos is AMAZING for me.   IT LASTS a LONG TIME.  It projects a good ways out and leaves a super nice scent trail.  People pick it up and are drawn into it, curious and inquisitive.  It will garner compliments.  Now i have read some comments here that indicate the longevity and silage are not great for some, for me, it is a BEAST.  Stays in place and stays strong for hours.  Skin chemistry plays a large role in all of this.  \n\nI cannot say enough good about this fragrance.  I have a lot of fragrances and I can tell you right now, Naxos is at the top or right at the top of the list for me.  It is a masterpiece, plain and simple.  If you want classy, elegant, amazing scent this is a great get.  I am about to purchase backup bottles of this because you never know....", "21": "An artisanal blend of honey + tobacco (with the latter quite prominent to my nose). Undisguisedly masculine. But ladies who love honeyed-tobacco scents could pull this actually. If you love A*Men Pure Havane or Fendi's Fan di Fendi frag, then grab Naxos. It's a far topnotch, niched rendition of both. Ideal for breezy evenings (having events like fashion gigs, soirees and brand activations)! Another olfactory curio by XERJOFF!!!\n\nIG: @mr_cornells", "22": "Amazing perfume! \nNaxos starts with lavender, a little citrus, honey and boozy notes.\nLater I feel honey and tobacco but very subtly. \nThe third phase, which is also the most beautiful to me, is a little vanilla and tonka and a lot of honey and with notes of Cuban tobacco.\nNaxos is perfect, ironed, luxurious, nothing bothers me. \nAlthough I have a bottle, I will buy another one soon, I adore this fragrance.\nThe presentation is outstanding.\nLongevity is over 20 hours. The projection is excellent.\nI always get a lot of compliments.", "23": "The easiest to wear tobacco I\u2019ve ever met. Opening leans masculine with lavender, citrus, cinnamon and a not-too-sweet honey, but in the dry down, a synthetic cashmeran and a good quality vanilla smooths the transition and Naxos becomes softer, more feminine. \n\nNaxos is the definition of a unisex scent even though the majority of reviews are by men. I just want the ladies to take note that Naxos is an interesting perfume. Excellent performance on my perfume eating skin; 2 hours of projection, and I can still the pick up the scent more than 24 hours after I applied it.", "24": "This one is just stunning. It does smell very similar to Pure Havane (which I love), but refined...less synthetic. I don't get that lovely cherry note that Pure Havane provides in the first few minutes, but other than that, Naxos is simply a smoother, more polished version of Pure Havane. The price WAS the main reason to go for Pure Havane over Naxos, but now, with Pure Havane and much of the Mugler \"Pure\" line being discontinued, the difference in price is negligible.\n\nNaxos is addicting. The tobacco in the dry-down is warm and rich. The honey and vanilla sweeten the tobacco perfectly. It's never cloying...just cozy. It is a cold-weather fragrance, to be sure. Whenever you catch wafts while walking outside on a cold, crisp day...it just puts a smile on your face. You want to smell it more. People that smell this on me compliment it constantly. This is a 10/10 fragrance for me.", "25": "The dry down is utterly gorgeous, a very well composed scent, warm, sweet, sophisticated, classy, the lavender in this is where the magic is at, also it's that differentiating element from the Pure Havane vibe. The freshness up top, the prominent jasmine which is so smooth, the rich honey, cinnamon sweetness which isn't cloying at all, the soft tobacco, all this put together make this scent very special. A true masterclass from Xerjoff. 10/10", "26": "Of all perfumes in my collection, this one is the best, for fall and winter. \nTop quality, long lasting, good sillage. \nNo more to add-iconic scent.", "27": "This begins with a sweet candy like citrus and a slight licorice feel that lasts for the first 15 or 20 minutes. After the sweetness begins to subside the heart of the fragrance begins to evoke a warm and inviting coconut feel which comes from the tobacco in the base mixing with the honey, jasmine and vanilla. The dry down is an excellent blonde tobacco paired with tonka and vanilla. Overall an excellent warm, beachy, and bright, vacation in a bottle style scent. Blonde tobacco done right. Great Longevity. Keep an eye out for tester bottles at fragrance discounters online. Can be worn from Spring through to late fall and perhaps even winter. This is hard not to like", "28": "Definitely a similarity to Pure Havane, but much higher quality, less linear, more refined and slightly more mature. Also smells less synthetic and more sensual. I don't normally like lavender but it works well here, very good fragrance. \n\n8/10", "29": "If you think you have smelled the best sweet tobacco scent in your life...wait until you've smelled Naxos, it is just divine. The dry down is a mix of lavender, tobacco, sweet honey, jasmine and bergamot. Absolute class of a scent and really unique. Perfect for the winter i would say, when temperatures are around freezing point. I just got my bottle, I can't get enough of the smell!", "30": "Creamy, smooth, luxurious. Great well-blended combination of notes. Lavender, cinnamon, tobacco, honey. This may sound very winter/autumn, but the lavender and the citrus notes make it a surprisingly good choice for spring as well.

Worth buying in my opinion.\n\n05/30/2019 - Compliment from a woman.\n05/31/2019 - Compliment from a woman giving me a hug 18 hours after I had applied. Long-lasting stuff.", "31": "Words cannot do justice to this fragrance, simply out of this world. Nothing compares to it.", "32": "Yes. Just yes. Heavy honey tobacco and amazing. Definitely better suited for cooler/colder weather. This is one of those fragrances that just smells incredible and lasts forever. A winter staple in my collection.\n\n10/10", "33": "A beautiful largely tobacco and honey fragrance but not too sweet, just perfect. Those who think this classy juice is in the same league as TM Amen Havane should be ashamed of themselves. Havane is a very poor wishy washy pale imitation. I think of Naxos like luxuriant warm autumn sunshine in a bottle. When the weather is rubbish then smile and wear this. I have SL Fourreau Noir and its a cooler feeling fragrance with a touch more lavender. The lavender is present but it is not strong and more like an accent note to enhance the others. I do get the tonka and vanilla which I think are more evident after and hour or two. This is one loved by both sexes. It has good sillage and lasts for many hours. I dare you to try it and not smile. Fantastic performance even in hot humid conditions.", "34": "The best Tobacco fragrance, and one of the most elegant and sophisticated scents ever.\n Pure Havane is No where near it, and I have both, not even close.\nThe ingredients in Naxos are top class.\nScent: 10/10\nLongevity: 10/10\nSillage: 9/10\nThis is truly a masterpiece", "35": "VilmaZ., you're not alone \ud83d\ude42\nI also smell cherry tobacco sometimes, as well as dusty dark cocoa powder.\nAbsolutely delightful, I'm obsessed with Naxos! \ud83d\ude0d Can't stop wearing it, even spray it before bed.", "36": "Got a sample of this last year completely new to niche fragrances. At first I didn't get what all the \u201chype\u201d was all about. To me this came off as a somewhat medicinal lavender air freshener with some refined sweetness to it. But after cleaning out my drawer and finding that decant, it dawned on me and finally hit me how gorgeous this actually is. Tons of people know it and have already explained it across fragcomm, so I don\u2019t need to say anything about it. All I\u2019ll say is I echo those same sentiments that praise this juice!", "37": "Gorgeous.   As much as I enjoy Pure Havane, I have trouble finding the right occasions to wear it because of its sweetness.  Naxos is much smoother, fresher, and has a fougere aspect that I find much more enjoyable.   This is going to be in heavy rotation this fall.  Very classy scent I love it.   Not redundant to own both, but if I had to only keep one this would be my choice all day, everyday.", "38": "Divinity in a bottle. The most sublime, lush, creamy, decadent, luscious, smooth honey drenched, sophisticated, sexy, intoxicating, addictive, sensual, f*cking drop dead slap yo mama gorgeous tobacco fragrance out there. Yes it is similar to Pure Havane. But Pure Havane barely even reaches Naxos' massive balls. He's just a little brat. Naxos is a fully chiseled, chesticled man, dripping with honey and drenched with citruses and wearing lavender in his hair and smoking a big ass cigar while being redolent of spices and sex. \n\nBasically this is the fragrance that took care of my cocaine habit.

I\u2019ll wear what I love.", "40": "\u201cOpulence.\u201d\nIf I had to describe this fragrance with one word. \n\nBeen trying to get my hands on this fragrance for pretty much the whole year. But fragrance companies just seem to never have this in stock. And I can see (smell) why. \n\nNaxos seems to get compared to Pure Havane quite often on this page. Which I have no clue... I never smelled Pure Havane. However, I\u2019m pretty sure PH doesn\u2019t smell as opulent, elegant, and velvety as Naxos does. \n\nFirst, the presentation is F*CKING incredible! I HAVE to mention it because not doing so seems almost criminal. The multiple layers, the soft faux (perhaps it is actually real) leather box, the soft fabric holding your bottle in place... even the box smells good. The bottle construction. I now expect nothing less from all these high end niche companies. Well done Xerjoff!\n\nUpon spraying my wrist, I immediately smell some sort of floral, citrusy, vanilla scent. I didn\u2019t expect the floral scent. I just expected something creamy and sweet like honey. It smells great! Just caught me off guard. The dry down is where it gets real good. I don\u2019t have the trained nose to smell the honey. But I know it\u2019s there.\n\nIt projects strongly and pretty much the whole day. I sprayed my sweater and dabbed my hand and went the gym and I can STILL smell fragrance on my hand after 13 hours and shower and several hand washes. I\u2019m not exaggerating.

I\u2019d say it\u2019s a safe blind buy. I plan on checking out PH next... but more than likely not buying. I\u2019m sure PH is easily eclipsed by Naxos and there\u2019s no point. Naxos is just that good. \n\nI\u2019d give this a 9.5 out of 10", "41": "A beautiful allrounder suited for any situation.

I understand it is supposed to embody Sicily and I can definitely correlate the concept with the perfume. \nI would only recommend if you love tonka because it\u2019s very strong here and gives a creamy and heavy sweetness like a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I imagine a charming Sicilian fellow in a well tailored suit, baked olive skin and delicate features wearing black ray bans and strolling casually in the sun, smoking a pipe of cherry tobacco. Salvatore Giliano\u2019s cousin Gaspare.  There is something raw and unfiltered about this fragrance compared to the refined counterpart Zefiro. This supposedly alludes to the contrast between Rome and Siciliy. Both are beautiful.", "44": "This stuff is absolutely gorgeous. This is my favourite scent for the winter, and I simply can't get enough of it. Blind buy worthy, no doubt.\n\nA few words about the scent? In the opening, it's this somewhat fresh with lavender and citrus. In the heart, the tobacco shines through, realistic and rich, joined by honeyed cherry. But the drydown is my favourite part, hands down. Honey, cherry, and vanilla that last for ages. Love, love, love.", "45": "Got a 1ml sample, tried that and just felt in love with that warm, joyful, prim scent... I wouldnt say its so similar to Pure Havane, they share some materials but the two are formed and built absolutely differently. I was afraid this might not project / last as I desire, but no worries now. Why now worries?\n\nBrief stories:\n1) I added 1 atomization to my shirt and after 2 days it still fills a 3m x 5m x 3m room easily within 20mins after a full ventilation.\n2) The day after I used naxos, woke up with stuffy nose but at my very first sniff felt a beautifully warm tobacco-vani scent with some noticable honey and fresh vibes... I almost started to cry, because I had really high expectations for Naxos, but its just wow.\n3) Packaging is excellent... box with the bottle may be 1 kg I assume wtf??? Amazing unboxing experience!\n\nSCENT\n10/10 - Very unique, warm, non-linear, mystical, sexual\n\nLONGEVITY\n10/10 - On clothes 24h+, on skin ~10h\n\nPROJECTION\n10/10 - I would say \"best fit\"\n\nSILLAGE\n10/10 - Two days after I added 2 atomizations to my coat, the others picked up within 0.5m range\n\nPRICE\n10/10 - Just because comapred to other high quality fragrances I find it slightly underpriced - still not cheap, but in its category just wow.\n\nPs.: my bottle was created in 2022.06, so its a 2022 bottle, still \"young\" but performs like a beast.\nOnly Xerjoff!", "46": "This is the definition of a head turning unisex fragrance that is very very versatile. The honey tobacco vanilla and citrus are blended so extremely well I can't even smell alcohol when it's wet on skin! It is just a very pleasing scent and I am proud to say it will be my first Xerjoff full bottle I purchase next to more than words which I will review next.\n9/10", "47": "An amazing fragrance.  Honey, vanilla, creamy,and finally a sweet, high quality tobacco accord.  Just oozes luxury and decadence. Long lasting with above average sillage.  My highest recommendation and will have a bottle in my collection for life.", "48": "Xerjoff Naxos I wasn\u2019t expecting much from it. I\u2019m not a fan of \u201csweet\u201d fragrances, and tobacco. I\u2019m really picky about that note. My curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to try it. There are plenty of fragrance\u2019s the community has hyped up\u2026. But oh boy this is a fantastic fragrance. Bought a decant, and quickly followed by a full bottle. \n\nThe quality is really good and I do think this is actually worth the retail price, but you can still find it for cheaper. I don\u2019t really care about packaging, but I had to keep the box this came in. Unlike other niche houses that charge a large sum of money, and mediocre packaging\u2026 Xerjoff is truly on another level. As always, try it before buying a full bottle.\n\nIt\u2019s sweet, yet fresh enough to wear in almost every season. I don\u2019t think this is good for very high heat. \n\nThe perfumer blended this so well. Performance is great. I only wear 1 spray to work, and 2-3 in other occasions. Lasts easily 8-12 hours on skin. Batch is from 2022 so don\u2019t worry about reformulation. \n\nI do think this can be worn as a signature scent; however this fragrance evokes a sense of luxury when you put it on. 9.5/10", "49": "Oh you little beauty!\n\nSo .. After years of just buying designer fragrances, Noir Extreme, Sauvage EDP, Spicebomb extreme .. you get the picture.\n\nI come across a few fragrance insta influencers and before I knew it I was watching GentSents, Chaos Fragrance and others. \n\nThis lead me to FragranceSamplesUk . Com\n\nI brought a fair few! To name some: 540 Extrait, Carlisle, Layton Exclusif, Interlude Man, Oud for Greatness, Side effect. Again! You get the idea. I went for the real powerhouses in all three departments. Longevity, Sillage and Niche popularity\n\nAnd without doubt .. Naxos below me away, far above all the others! Naxos was light, yet rich. Fragrant yet syrupy. And probably the first fragrance I've ever experienced that takes you on a journey like no other, well not that I've witnessed and I've now tested and brought some absolute gems! Random shout-out to D&G The One LUMINOUS NIGHTS, yeah Fragrantica and YouTubers aren't lying about that, if you can find it, good god buy it! Amazing. \n\nBut back to Naxos, it is just absolutely stunning, it smells like pure luxury. As much as us men tend to long over powering menacing fragrances like Spicebomb Extreme in the designer world and Interlude man in the niche world, they fill your nostrils, perhaps too much at times. Yet Naxos is the most perfect balance between Nostril filling and \"Wow, what is that!\" \n\nHead turning fragrance - YES\nLongevity - Easy 8/9 hours with great projection\nSillage - As mentioned above, absolutely!\n\nIf you're new to niche and wondering what to try or what to experience first, I cannot stress Naxos enough! \n\nThis will now pip Halfeti (which was my wedding day fragrance and therefore holds a dear place in my heart) and will now become my signature scent\n\nEDIT: \n\nI've now had my bottle of Naxos for around 5 months, still absolutely love it and is almosty certainly the bottle I gravitate towards the most. However one comment I would add is my original sample of this fragrance was from the sample site I mention above. And the lavender in that sample was undeniablely noticeable in the opening and really added to the blend of notes in that first hour or two. The honey would dance with the lavender and you'd get a really sophisticated contrast between the syrup and fragrant notes. However on my bottle I purchased at the end of 2022, the lavender isn't as strong. Maybe my bottle just needs to macerate. But this doesn't detract from the scent. Still an absolute 10/10, but thought worth mentioning."}, "30": {"0": "For me LVEB is so beautiful, warm, elegant, and womanly.  \nEvery time I wear it, I feel the class and elegance in its sweet-floral aroma. I receive also very frequently compliments because of this beauty. Today, for ex., in a meeting, 2 workmates asked me for the name. \nIt\u00b4s very popular indeed, but I don\u00b4t care!!!! LVEB makes me feel beautiful, classy and special and at the end of the day, I carry the perfume, it\u00b4s not the other way around. We were born special with LVEB or without it. The time is too short, so let\u00b4s enjoy what we want. If you like it, go for it.  \nIt\u00b4s beautiful and it offers also very good flankers in the pipeline. Projection and Longevity are awesome. \nSuper Product!", "1": "Lanc\u00f4me is the type of company that usually launches great fragrances, which become a sales success, every five years or so. And they all mark generations! We have, for example, Tr\u00e9sor (1990), Po\u00eame (1995), Miracle (2000), Hypnose (2005), among others.\nIn 2012, it was La Vie Est Belle's turn. The creative concept explores a fragrance capable of making any woman happy and everything was thought to convey that effect, including the bottle. Its project was started in 1949 by Armand Petitjean, founder of Lanc\u00f4me, and represents a crystal smile. It took more than a year for the effect to be achieved, creating the impression of a smile. \nThe fragrance was the first iris-gourmand ever made by the brand and featured the work of three big names in the industry: Anne Flipo, Olivier Polge, and Dominique Ropion. According to the Lanc\u00f4me communication area, the palette has 63 ingredients (half of them of natural origin) and it took more than 5.000 tests - in fact, 5.521 - until final approval. \nLa Vie Est Belle Eau de Parfum (in the box, L'Eau de Parfum) has a vibrant composition, which was created to reinterpret the luminosity of the magnolia. And there is a detail that is poorly publicized on the market: the note of Iris Pallida of Florence is present in all stages of evolution, so it is considered a transversal note, although it has been listed in the body of the fragrance. Other important (and very confuse) information is due to the note of cassis (Black Currant), which appears in most Brazilian and North American texts, but changes in some official pages of the brand, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, which list Blackberries. As a critic, I could not leave this aspect out of the analysis, reinforcing the immense amount of communication failures that I find in the industry. \nThat being said, I will stick to what is on both pages, which list pears and blackberries (at the exit), followed by an iris concrete and absolutes of Sambac jasmine and of orange blossom (in the heart), on a base of patchouli essence. And going through all the fragrance, another transversal note, called Accord of delicacies, that would be the combination of vanilla and praline and gives the gourmand effect. \nLa Vie Est Belle combined a well-produced campaign (bringing an actress with a broad smile and public empathy) with a highly accepted fragrance that became a benchmark in the industry. Before that, only one other attracted so much attention from the female audience and the competition: Flowerbomb (2005 / Viktor & Rolf) which, by the way, brought the touch of two equal perfumers involved in its process. Coincidence? \nOn the skin, La Vie Est Belle is exuberant, in all possible meanings: abundant, rich, filling, etc. It has a little bit of everything and at the same time, nothing in exaggeration. From the moment it touches the skin, it's sweet, sensual, warm, slightly dry and powdery, it's floral, it's gourmand ... it's amazing! For these and other reasons, women who have always complained of sweet fragrances have surrendered to their charms, as well as those who do not like fragrances that are too floral or powdery. It is a floral-gourmand, which has vitality and exudes femininity, without pulling into an exclusive age group. \nIn my perception, it looks like a dessert in which slices of pear and petals of jasmine were crystallized and watered with a caramel syrup. Then, an iris powder was gently sprinkled on the dish and, next to it, a kind of tea made with the leaves and roots of patchouli was served, to accompany and give the necessary contrast. \nThere is still a lot of comparison to the Flowerbomb fragrance. But I, in particular, feel that the latter has more floral content. The biggest connection comes from the patchouli note, but I still think that one is more open and oriental, while the other is denser and gourmand.\nIt's no wonder that La Vie Est Belle has become one of the most copied fragrances in every corner of the world, involving companies that make inspired perfumes and, of course, the most famous brands that will never admit the true intention. In less than a decade, it has generated more than 15 flankers, including limited editions. \nYou may not even like La Vie Est Belle, but you must admit its role in world perfumery. After all, we need to respect a winner when we come across one!", "2": "La Vie Est Belle: Life Is Beautiful. \nThis fragrance is absolutely beautiful. Alluring, feminine, pretty and sweet. This fragrance opens with the juicy, fruity, gummy, sweet pear and black currant. Very delicious and captivating. I loved it instantly. It then develops into a more powdery, soft smell when the iris note comes through, lingering with the gummy fruit from the opening. When it dries it becomes a little bit creamer with the praline and vanilla, still powdery from the floral notes but with less juiciness from the fruit. \nI really love this. I just kept sniffing my arm and as it develops it becomes even more beautiful. The sillage on this is fantastic. I could smell it through-out the say from just one spray on my wrist. Gorgeous.", "3": "I'm not sure about the noted similarity to flowerbomb because I've only smelled it once and it's been some time ago. However, La Vie Est Belle is an amazing sweet but not-too-sweet iris-praline scent that's unlike any fragrance I've smelled before! This would be best worn during autumn season, IMHO. I find it fairly linear, but that is quiet alright with me! The tonka bean is light, thank goodness because I find that note to often be cloying. The iris is wrapped in consoling sweet praline. I don't smell the pear, jasmine, or black currant. The patchouli is very soft in the drydown. The bottle is simplistic yet elegant and lovely with the accent bow.  \nI give it a 5 STAR rating!", "4": "I don\u2019t care if it is one of the most popular perfumes out there, I love it. It\u2019s warm, sweet and sensual. I always get compliments and people regularly ask me what I am wearing and are surprised when I say LVEB. I think the problem is many people overspray it, I just put a small dab on the inside of my elbows and it lasts for hours. I have been wearing it regularly for the last 8 years and I am only on my second bottle. Treat LVEB with respect and it will love back. Overspray and it will give you and everyone around you a blinding headache", "5": "La Vie Est Belle is a treasure. There is absolutely a good reason why it is the reigning queen of fragrance right now.. it just smells good, plain and simple. It is sweet, strong, luxurious, and long lasting.. and nothing else smells like it. Other popular fragrances like Flowerbomb, La Nuit Tresor, and Black Opium share a similar vibe but LVEB is unmistakable. \n\nI used to think of it as a \"basic bitch\" scent until I realized I'm part of that Starbucks-drinking, leggings-with-Uggs wearing camp anyway and then I learned to embrace it ;) LVEB is ubiquitous where I live and maybe that also put me off it a little at first but I ended up being seduced and now own the two strongest flankers.. after all, I want to retain some uniqueness at least! But I do have a sample of LVEB I wear at times and deeply enjoy.\n\nLVEB opens with a juicy burst of blackberries and pear and settles into the signature sparkling praline, vanilla, and patchouli melange with the fruit taking a backseat in the drydown. At this point the fragrance is so well blended the only thing my nose really picks out is the praline and then \"everything else\" which is uniquely LVEB. There is really just nothing else like it. \n\nI love all types of perfumes.. classics, drugstore cheapies, celeb scents.. I can enjoy the heavy hitters from past decades and appreciate their presence in fragrance history as much as I appreciate what Lancome has done for fragrances today. I love the fruitchouli trend and find it just as essential as the eras of orientals, animalics, chypres, aldehydes, 80s powerhouses, etc. All hail the queen of this generation's perfume--LVEB! \n\nLife truly is beautiful :)\n\nEdit: I had to buy a full bottle.. I used my sample up quick, I can't get enough of this scent!!", "6": "I adore this fragrance and think it's wonderful in every regard. Apparently, a few other people agree with me. I suppose this makes me very \"Basic Beatch\" in the high-falootin' opinions of those far richer, more important, and exponentially more intelligent and sophisticated than little ole country bumpkin me.\n\nVery similar (not a DUPE but SIMILAR) to Sofia Vergara's SOFIA to my common, untrained nose (like Sofia + Praline).\nScent: Gorgeous. 10/10.\nSillage: Moderate to Enormous (depends on application). \nLongevity: no less than moderate (money well spent).\n\nSo, you sophisticated types pay me no mind at all while I revel in the beauty of this \"common\" (in other words, popular and well-loved) fragrance for the ignorant masses. Now, clutch your pearls if you must, but I am only capable of enjoying a fragrance for the beauty of the composition and its performance. So, while others are choking on intellectually-complicated, unpleasant compositions, I'll happily (in the bliss of my simple-minded ignorance) choose to remain deliberately unsophisticated and continue to adore this beauty of a fragrance (like almost everyone else obviously does).\n\nOn a slightly more serious note, though, if you want to like LVEB but find something in it off-putting, Sofia Vergara's SOFIA may work with your chemistry with more pleasant results as Sofia doesn't have that \"praline\" note.", "7": "Warning: Graphic Review! Please do not read if you are easily grossed out by bodily functions. This is a  respectful and sincere review.\n\nI am not fundamentally against sweet, mass-marketed fragrances. I am a huge fan of Sugar Lychee by Fresh, and though I'm not sure I would ever want to wear it, I am delighted by the crimson raspberry Jello scent of Escada's Cherry In The Air. That said, I still think that if you're gonna do a synthetic gourmand-floral fragrance, you should be mindful of any bitter chemical \"aftertaste\" that could send the whole composition down the tubes. \n\nEven though I could smell it from across the room before I opened the bottle, I had high hopes for this one. For clarity's sake, I do not get sidetracked by bottles or titles when writing fragrance reviews and do my best to concentrate only on the juice itself, but in this instance, the bottle and the name were both begging the question: Is this in fact, what makes life beautiful? If not THE thing, then at least one of the things? \n\nLa Vie Est Belle by Lancome has a very sweet, ambiguously fruity and floral composition. The projection is out of this world, and the longevity is excellent. After application and giving it a few minutes to settle, I sniffed deeply into it, trying to penetrate the layers of fluffy pink sugar sweetness and slightly green, slightly powdery and somewhat medicinal CGI florals.\n\nWhat I found underneath these fluffy layers was a disturbingly bitter flat-line of chemical aftertaste. It was like an even streak of ugly yellow road paint severing this fragrance right through the center of its fluffy pink heart. \n...Then I had to drop a #2. \n\nI had to use the bathroom NOT BECAUSE of the fragrance! It was mere coincidence, and I only even mention it because I feel it is relevant to this review. This forum is about good and bad scents, really, ALL the scents, and my seemingly ill-timed trip to the bathroom turned out to be a blessing in disguise. \n\nI was super unhappy about having to scrub my hands with dish detergent after using the bathroom and starting this review over, but while I was sitting there, lamenting this inevitability, La Vie Est Belle still projecting it's chemical radiance in the direction of my face, something occurred to me.\n\nThis fragrance smells nothing at all like life. This is gonna sound ridiculous, but my own refuse smelled \"fresh\" compared to Lancome's chemical monstrosity co-mingling in the air. Next to the smell of fresh #2, La Vie Est Belle, is the most inorganic, lifeless, and unpalatable concoction of elements imaginable. Try it and see for yourself.\n\nIt's almost as if it were solely invented by a computer, for computers. It's as if someone made it with utter lack of regard for our natural chemistry, and instead invented a fragrance for something that didn't, doesn't, and never will smell like anything living. While I was sampling, I was actually slightly nervous about my cat getting near it.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong. I am not particularly enamored with the smell of poop, but AT LEAST it smells like what it's supposed to. What began as an inconvenient natural urge ended up serving as a reminder to me that life (and the beauty it's made of) do not include the realm of La Vie Est Belle. I never would have imagined I would have been forced to make this comparison, but now I am very grateful I did.", "8": "I always get a kick out of reading reviews for this fragrance. Especially the ones that need to tell someone how much better their taste is and \"for the love of God, stop wearing this fragrance\" types. I even wonder about the ones that need to defend the fact that they like it - or worse, try to find middle ground, as if they can escape a truly hideous fate of loving a perfume that not everyone else does. Or maybe it's bc everyone else does? Hmmm, deep.  If you are truly secure in your most excellent taste, why would you need to put another person down over a perfume choice? That screams insecurity and any first year psyche student would have loads of fun diagnosing those reviewers. \n\nThis perfume? It's pretty. I like the second flanker better, no patch, added hazelnut and whipped cream and it's sweeter!

I wasn't frivolous, I wasn't emotional, I was one of the boys!\n\nSo things like La Vie Est Belle were rather problematic for me: deep down, I longed for it, because it was pretty and lovely, a softer, more worked out cousin to Flowerbomb. But all the other girls were wearing it, and so if it's popular then it mustn't be any good, right?\n\nUltimately, I realised much of my desire to stand out from other women came from insecurities instilled in me by an unkind, unintelligent society... They were pitting me AGAINST other women! I was letting men's perception of me warp what I liked or didn't like! SCREW THAT.\n\nSo you know what? I ultimately thought: La Vie Est Belle is a crowd-pleasing, sugary, girly, pink, derivative gourmand made for pretty girls in pretty dresses.\n\nAnd I like it.

If LA Vie Belle could talk she would enter a room and say \"At last, I have arrived, you may be seated now\". \n\nThe fragrance is absolutely divine, remarkable and stunning. La Vie belle has no flaws. I commend the House of Lancome for creating such decadence and perfection. A complete masterpiece.

Give it more than one chance and don't listen to those trying to pigeonhole LVEB into a certain age segment. And if ninety percent of the female population wears it, so what? LVEB has earned its place in the perfume world, it's a high quality mainstream fragrance and about as polarizing as Mugler's Angel, and if it makes you feel youthful, charming and sexy, then all the better, enjoy it! Perfume is on the market to make us feel better about ourselves in the first place, ladies.\n\nNow I'll share with you my experience with this new classic fragrance, and it might not be an entirely positive review, but I must be honest here. \nI've owned a bottle of LVEB for more than three years now and it's a strong like for me, not a love due to the fact that the patchouli in it is too prominent on my skin and gets a dirty ashtray vibe after a few hours of wear. Anyway, despite its behavior on my skin, I do enjoy it. I reach for it more rarely than I do other fragrances in my collection, and even though LVEB never got me compliments, I'd buy another bottle of it...

But hmmm, haven\u2019t I smelled it before?? Oh yeah, Flowerbomb! Seriously, this smells A LOT like Flowerbomb. Funny how this frag is categorized as a floral fruity gourmand and Flowerbomb is categorized as an oriental floral. They are soooo similar! \n\nOkay, so what\u2019s different about them? Well I find La Vie Est Belle to be slightly more fruity upfront, and a bit richer. Also, the sillage/projection/lasting power is superior (almost too strong, if you ask me!). On the drydown, La Vie Est Belle has a nice soft, rich vanilla that is clearly absent with Flowerbomb. \n\nSo basically, La Vie is the full fat, gourmand, rich version, and Flowerbomb is the light, tea-laden, laylike, fat-free version. Both are absolutely amazing in my opinion, but as for the question of owning both? That\u2019s a toss up. I have already owned Flowerbomb for many years and although I used to wear it to death, I don\u2019t wear it as much anymore and so I think I would indeed consider buying La Vie Est Belle.

I'm not saying that I like the extreme opposite, which would be an unbearably strong fragrance, but this in my opinion is perfect.  It projects, but doesn't seem suffocating.  Like I said, I'm wearing it right now and I can smell it on myself without being totally overwhelmed.  It's beautiful, warm, inviting, sexy and just a great fragrance.

I could see this being an instant mood lifter, making you see life as beautiful indeed. ;0)\n\nP.S. It had great silage and lasting power. No worries in that department what so ever! And the bottle is gorgeous in person.  Lancome has made a lovely fragrance with La Vie Est Belle.", "20": "I remember when I first tried this perfume in 2012. It was a sunny hot humid summer day. The perfume was strong and didn't fit in with that heat. As the day moved on and it became chilly in the evening... it was then that I decided I loved it and I never looked back. On my six year anniversary with this scent, I love it more than ever.\n\nWhat I learned over the years was that this perfume really shines brightest in the right conditions.  For me, its a cool evening or any time there is a slight chill in the air. I live in a coastal area with an almost constant cool wind and this perfume fits perfectly with these conditions. \n\nThis perfume is balanced and perfectly composed. First, I pick up pear and orange blossom. Then a bit of jasmine. Then vanilla, tonka and praline. Then an earthy patchouli.  Somewhere in there is a hint of iris and blackcurrent which adds a unique twist. This is a multi dimensional perfume and develops beautifully. It is of the highest quality and projects well with just two sprays and it lasts all evening. Even while sleeping I wake up and smell it on my wrist and it comforts me. \n\nI love this perfume so much that I am a collector.  This is the only perfume that I own and love every version of. Of all the versions, the original EDP is still my favorite and the one I have continuously turned to. It is the one I have purchased the most number of bottles of over the years and worn on the most variety of occasions.  This is also the scent that I have received the most compliments on. When people ask me what it is, I say \"La Vie Est Belle\" and I feel like I am making a beautiful philosophical declaration about life.\n\nThis is a soulful perfume and this has been accurately captured in the scent itself. It is a celebration of all the simply beautiful treasures in life. The bottle is a gorgeous work of art to be displayed. The light pink orange of the perfume is cheerful. The box is thoughtful. It has braille under the title on the side of the box. It is the first perfume to ever consider that the blind are very scent oriented. Scent of a Woman. It lists a description of the perfume like an international dictionary on the side. It is very thoughtfully laid out. The advertising is perfect with Julia Roberts breaking free of the invisible chains of conformity, freeing herself and then shining that childlike joyful smile to light up the world.\n\nLa Vie Est Belle is truly beautiful and I have loved it since it came out in 2012. It has seen me through every spectacular moment, every special occasion, every tragedy, every transformation. This scent always reminds me to treasure the simple joys in life. Every time I spray this perfume on, it is like receiving a gift. It is a balm to my soul and makes me feel beautiful in the deepest sense of the word. \n\nIncredible work Lancome!  Thank you to the whole team who created this incredibly special perfume. Please don't ever stop making it.", "21": "This is an alluring fragrance.  It's sophisticated, sweet, and sexy.  A woman wearing this scent lingers in my mind all day.  It has great longevity, and I can't stop hugging my friends who wear it!  From a male's perspective, this is an exceptional perfume.\n\nLa Vie Est Belle starts with a beautiful sweet floral that seems heavy but is light.  Some light patchouli soon enters into the mix.  Overall, it still has a sharp sweetness that is candy-like and quite yummy.  Eventually, it all smoothes out to a subdued patchouli by praline and vanilla that is a lovely, fluffy sweetness.  One spray of La Vie can go all day with nice sillage.", "22": "Yes everyone wears this perfume, yes you can smell it every where, but guess what ? I DON\u2019T CARE I LOVE IT. Seriously one of the best perfumes ever", "23": "Today is Valentines Day and my husband being the fragrance collecting enabler that he is, Bought me an AMAZING Gift Set of La Vie Est Belle with a 3.4 oz EDP, a mini, a Rollerball and full size lotion/body wash. And as if that wasn't a girls dream enough, a Lanc\u00f4me eyeshadow pallet & Skincare set to boot. He knows it's been on me wishlist for some time. \n\nAnyways, So I woke up to that lovely gift this morning at 7am and of course immediately indulged in a spray. It is 5pm and that ONE squirt still smells freshly sprayed! No joke. And I am one of those people who struggles to get the most beastly powerhouses to stick around for more than 2 hours!  This juice is legit, ladies. It really does smell heavenly but if you don't like sweet scents, stray away from LVEB because it IS sweet. Okay, so Then we went out for Thai food and TWO different people stopped me to inquire about the scent. It's truly that good. And you know it's silage is decent when people are smelling it over all the curry and lemongrass in the air of a little Thai restaurant! I mean, I realize I've only spent 10 hours with this fragrance and to some of you that probably seems WAY too early in the game to review, but as my husband said after the second compliment , \"Geez, that perfume has already proven its worth the money!\" And frankly I'd have to agree. The EDP set alone was probably 200$, but worth every cent! When I blow through this bottle (which will take forever considering its tenacity and strength) I will most definitely repurchase... heck, I may even go for the ridiculous big 6.8 oz bottle next time! lol\n\nTo summarize my long review: This is quality stuff and it's very easy to understand why it's the #1 selling female fragrance in Paris, France. Also, don't let the MANY comparisons to Flowerbomb throw you off in either direction! If you're not a fan of FB, don't assume you won't like this and if you love FB and are looking for a longer lasting dupe, you won't find it here! They smell nothing alike to me.", "24": "I respectfully disagree with the detractors.  This stuff is incredible.  \n\nI received a sample last Christmas as part of a Sephora gift set and this was the full size bottle I elected to purchase.  AMAZING.  \n\nFor reference, I still consider Obsession to be my signature scent.  I also love Spellbound, Prada Candy, and Organza Indecence.  I am an Oriental/Gourmand lady. La Vie Est Belle is in my top five favorites for life.  \n\nIf you have any doubts about it, your local Lancome counter will provide you with a sample vial or two.  Try it, you will love it!  Who cares if every other woman is wearing it?  There's a reason for that. Men go nuts over it ... and I am over 40! :)  \n\nThis stuff is Flowerbomb but with better lasting power and a kinder price tag, in my opinion.  Just lovely.", "25": "I didn't like this when it first came out, I was definitely on Team Flowerbomb or Team Si before La Vie Est Belle. Years have passed since I've worn it, so last week I gave another sample a try. Somehow, the absence has made me appreciate its strong points.\n\nIt's the very definition of a fruitchouli. Sparkling, sweet, a little nutty, a little chocolatey, fruity (like a grapey smell), and perfumey. It smells good, and everyone around you will think so as well, even if you're a light sprayer. I appreciate this - I appreciate that I can smell this all day, but I don't have to spray too much and overwhelm myself to do so. I had sprayed this on about 6+ hours before going to yoga, and the yoga instructor after 5 minutes remarked that someone smelled so good in the class. I have a suspicion that it was me.\n\nSome days I get more of the dessert taste, the chocolatey enveloping feeling of a good gourmand perfume. Other times I smell more sparkling pear. It's a good fall perfume, and an easy dumb reach. It's nothing that would ever be my favorite, but I 100% understand why so many people love it, and I am going to keep this on standby for gifts when I'm uncertain what to give. \n\nIt's a new classic perfume, perfect for those who grew up on vanilla fruity body sprays, but also loved by those who enjoyed the older perfumes. It's a practical perfume, checks all boxes, enjoyed by all ages and everyone around you - for that, it deserves credit!", "26": "I tried to stay away from this one as I kept hearing about how overdone and basic it is, but tbh I just love it, if you don\u2019t like sweet perfumes you\u2019re definitely not gonna like this but if you do, this is such an easy to wear girly and pretty perfume, it smells almost sparkling to me \na plus is that men really like this in my experience, in fact this is my boyfriend\u2019s favorite perfume from what I own\nEdit: wow is this headache inducing, go easy on the sprays for sure", "27": "I know many say this is just another Flowerbomb but its really not.Although, it starts off similar these two ships end up different.This fragrance ends with Iris there is no Iris in Flowerbomb.And you will find the powdered vanilla Iris blended with patch.But, to me this essentially an Iris scent.Its more natural expensive ingredients that makes it linger but not shout.The bottle is a work of art.3 of the best perfumers in the world made this and I think it is amazing.I especially love the smile on the bottle.", "28": "this is pure bliss ..in a long time i didn't smell something so nice ..sweet.. sexy.. simple ..clean..young..yet feminine juicy..amazing...a timeless classic ..i am sure it will be..let alone the beautiful classy sophisticated bottle..its a treasure on its own..\nits fresh yet sensual ..mellow ..full ..yet not overpowering ..i feel its got grapefruit ..as it dries down ..it envelops your senses..its velvety ..the sweetness mellows down to pure seduction.. a passionate.. romantic.. loyal.. independent.. pure.. perfume ..it reminds me of fine  old french perfumes.. with a modern sensual twist..\ni am not a floral lover ,but they made a beautiful connotation in this one..a must have..\n\nrating 4.7 out of 5", "29": "Because of the marketing for this scent and the bottle design, I always assumed this was a classy, mature floral scent but it\u2019s a well balanced gourmand with slight floral notes. Very sweet but not fake smelling. I think it\u2019s simply popular to hate on this scent in the fraghead/ fragrance community as it\u2019s labeled \u201cbasic\u201d but honestly some chypres are wildly popular too so none of that matters. If you like a scent, you like it. If it isn\u2019t for you- fine but you can\u2019t deny this scent is strong and long lasting. If you like gourmands or sweet florals, you\u2019ll like this.", "30": "I absolutely love La Vie Est Belle....\nits sweet and beautiful,  it lasts on me for around 8 hours,  so its perfect for work, with no need to re-apply at lunchtime like I frequently do with others. \nI walked into the kitchen to make a drink,  then walked out,,  then went back in 5 minutes later and I could still smell where I had been  previously.\nIts a perfume I can smell on me for the whole time I wear it,  others I have DO smell if I hold up my wrist and sniff, or if I ask my husband if he can still smell it, but often I cant smell it after 2-3 hours.....but LVEB I can smell the whole time...  I just spray behind each ear,  and each wrist....so just 4 sprays,  and this lasts all day.  its such a beautiful fragrance  so I'm more than happy to smell it all day.", "31": "I really, really like La Vie Est Belle, yet somehow, she's never been a love. But that's ok, I still cherish the 30 ml I have of her. She is a class act and one on her own. She deserves to become a future classic, which she undoubtedly will be.\n\nIt has that distinct Lanc\u00f4me edge, that very perfumey aspect to it, that sometimes I suppose I find too heavy. Other times I crave smelling that way. It's polished but there's nothing subtle about it. It creates a cloud around you of flowers and chocolate and vanilla and patchouli, overspray and it will lodge in the back of your throat and choke out those around you. One squirt of this and my husband goes all theatrical with the whole, 'Jesus, you're not 'sposed to spray 20 times, are you trying to kill me, I cannot BREATHE', nonsense. Seriously. ONE spray. I can spray anything else until the cows come home and he doesn't normally bat an eyelid. But it's still a gorgeous smell and lasts literally years on sleeves of jackets! \n\n\nOn a side note, I also love how people who wear this fragrance seem to be as pleasant as the scent itself. I like that negative reviews of this scent are allowed to stay up, unlike with say, a perfume such as Coco. No one is attacked for disliking it, which is lovely. It's a beautiful, classy, sweet scent, just as I imagine the women are who wear it.", "32": "This is a fragrance that I have rated as one of my top 5 however, I had not worn it in months.  Today I remembered why I love this so much.  It\u2019s an incredible one.  You might love it or you might hate it.  It has MY heart!", "33": "Honestly I don\u2019t understand why people HATE this perfume.. on me the patchouly mixes so nice with the florals, praline and vanilla it literally smells HEAVENLY I also live in a tropical environment so I normally wear this in 80+ degrees Fahrenheit and it still smells super nice and doesn\u2019t make me nauseous or get headaches", "34": "I got to smell this today while I was out and about. I like it and I agree that it is sweet; I get quite a bit of praline out of the scent. To me, this smells like a cross between Flowerbomb and Miss Dior Cherie. It's like they combined the powdery vanilla of Flowerbomb with the buttery popcorn aroma of Cherie. I think those who miss the popcorn note in the new Cherie would like La vie est belle. If I didn't already have the two aforementioned frags, I would purchase this in a heartbeat because it's sweetness is right up my alley. Very nice job Lancome!", "35": "One of the best gourmands on the market, hands down. Wonderful connection between the vanilla base and the blackcurrent and pear top notes. This is the work of a master perfumer.\n\nSome points:\n-Makes an good signature scent (but be warned, it's pretty popular. If you're looking for the wonderfulness of La Vie est Belle but you also want something unique that not everyone is wearing, try \"Chinatown\" by Bond No. 9! In terms of that fine gourmand quality it stands toe to toe with this one).\n-Very strong stuff. Heads will turn. This is a showstopper.\n-If wearing casually, a dab will do ya. Like, just a dab.\n-Winter, fall and maybe spring, but not summer. Way too heavy.\n-This is a \"wedding\" quality fragrance. Ideal for special and sentimental occasions.\n-In my opinion this can't be worn casually (unlike Chinatown which I suggested... Chinatown can be worn both casually and formally). Think of it as a treat.", "36": "Hello my dear people, I'm back with a comment! I haven't written one for ages. What moved me to comment again is the downright \"execution\" of the scent \"La vie est belle\", which I sometimes find exaggerated. Of course everyone has a different taste and some fragrances just don't suit you, but I can't believe that you give this perfume 10% or less percent here. It breaks my heart! Apparently some here cannot distinguish between a poorly crafted fragrance and their personal taste. The suspicion creeps up on me that the apparently very great success of the fragrance is already suspicious for some people ... According to the motto: What the \"mainstream\" likes can only be junk. Then an American actress (really bad!) Advertises the fragrance - it's almost a celebrity fragrance, aha, aha, aha! They just want to sell the perfume (how absurd ;-))! You should smell it at every corner! It would be nice, unfortunately it rarely smells like it anywhere ...\nFor me, \"La vie est belle\" is a fantastic, wonderful fragrance, simply fantastic, great perfumery. You can tell that the ingredients are of very high quality. Nothing synthetic interferes here, everything smells natural and elegant: First a fresh, tart, juicy currant, then a flowing transition into the extremely noble sea of flowers (especially iris and orange blossom), then with chocolate / praline (patchouli, sometimes not overdosed!) and a touch, just a touch of cotton candy to finish off. Not too sweet at all, but fluffy, light and floating, that's my impression. For me it has only a little to do with Flowerbomb etc., in my opinion it is far superior to this in terms of quality and design, as it is much more multifaceted. At Lanc\u00f4me, true masters of their craft were at work, I can easily tell from this fragrance. I could bathe in it, but here the dose makes the poison, that's clear to me! As a frequent sprayer, I have to pull myself together, spraying 1 - 2 times is enough. Therefore a warning: an overdose is particularly harmful and counterproductive!\nOtherwise, I'm very, very sure that in a few years time it will be one of the great classics!", "37": "I'm a man and this is my favorite female fragrance. The woman of my dreams wears this!", "38": "You know, I used to think that this was almost identical to Flowerbomb but now that I have a minis of both, I can definitely smell the differences. They are similar, no doubt about that, but Flowerbomb is heavier on the patchouli, whereas LVEB is sweeter and fruitier, like Flowerbomb's little sister. Boy is this stuff long-lasting! Silage is very heavy when first sprayed and you can really smell the syrupy black currants, but the dry-down is all praline, vanilla and tonka bean on me. Simply yummy. Makes me want to curl under a blanket and sip a cup of hot chocolate :P", "39": "There is a reason this perfume is so popular. It is the longest lasting perfume I have ever worn! I can literally spray myself at 9am and am still able to smell it in the evening. The smell is intoxicating and I always receive compliments when I wear it. This perfume is very special.", "40": "I love this scent, it smells like fine belgium chocolate on a nice Valentine's day. With a nice floral touch of course. Definitely made my want list!", "41": "This fragrance is simply beautiful, and so befitting of its name. It's a masterpiece that appeals to so many, in the same way that Coco Mademoiselle and Miss Dior do.\n\nWith the first spray of this I get a delicious lightly fruity patchouli that reminds me of Coco Mademoiselle. The patchouli also really grounds the middle notes of praline, jasmine and orange blossom. The lingering dry-down of this (that lasts for days on clothes and skin) is vanilla and warm iris, which lends a powdery comfort to this.\n\nThis fragrance has become my \"night-time\" scent, whether I am out with friends or curled up with a cup of tea at home. It manages to balance sweetness, sophistication and comfort in a wonderful way.  \n\nLancome fragrances are simply beautiful. This is the third I have fallen in love with after Tr\u00e9sor in Love and Tr\u00e9sor Midnight Rose. <3 \n\nMy mother-in-law got me the gift set. Buying me fragrance could have gone so wrong (I'm picky)- but she scored! I also love wearing the body cream in this scent with a spritz of Wild Bluebell on top for freshness.\n\nNote: I do not like Flowerbomb at all- it's headache inducing to me, while this fragrance has never bothered me.\n\nEdit Feb 2, 2017: This is such a complex fragrance. Today, for the first time, I caught the fresh citrus orange blossom in the top note! Now I can't avoid smelling it. I love orange blossom, so it makes me smile.\n\nI've been wearing it for about seven months now, on special occasions and when I want to feel sophisticated, elegant, beautiful and comforted. This manages to capture all of those things in a floral-gourmand that is the epitome of good French perfumery.\n\nThis perfume is iconic.\n\nPS- Please stop overspraying this, people! This is one that you MUST spray in the air and walk into to avoid suffocating the people around you. When you do, it is divine. Overspray, and it's sickly.", "42": "I was about to buy the Prada Candy until I smelled this and instantly changed my mind. This is like an amped up Prada Candy. Candy on steroids, or a sugar high if you will. ;)\n\nThis is exactly what I was expecting from Candy and everything it's not. It's sweet, fudgey, praline, sugary (dare I say buttery caramel) and very STRONG. I might have a bad nose or my body chemistry might be off but the florals weren't very noticable to me. It wasn't until reading the notes that I paid attention and still they were very faint. This is more of a pure sugar/candy scent to me with the exception for the drydown which transforms to a sweet powder with hints of vanilla.\n\nThis lasts for hours and one small spritz on clothes or paper can last for days. In other words it's the ultimate gourmand, if you like it that is, otherwise I imagine the incredible potency of this perfume would prove to be a nightmare.", "43": "This and Tresor are the most complementary perfume hands down! Literally every time I when I have this on, someone would follow me to ask what it is!\nThis is very sweet but it\u2019s a personal preference. It heavy vanilla and praline and the dry down my goodness \u2764\ufe0f\nThis is an absolute masterpiece. \nIt\u2019s a perfect gift for your loved one. 10/10", "44": "After I got samples of LVEB again and again and always ignored them because I know the scent and smell it on others all the time, I finally decided to give it another try on my skin and review it.\n\nTo me this is a very moody scent. Sometimes it's sparkly, smooth and delicious and something just cloying, flat and abrasive. This is the case on my skin, but also when I smell it on others. It's really important not to overdose it. Today it's lovely on my hand. \n\nThe scent starts out with a sugared waxy iris, almost a little lipstick-like, but much sweeter and with added fruit notes of pear and cassis. Later it dries down to something akin to a praline with a vanilla and black currant filling and a light dusting of powder. Patchouli is always present, but to me this is a rather high-pitched patch, I wish it was a little deeper.\nMany have compared LVEB to Flowerbomb, but I disagree with that. Both are sweet and have patch, but that's where it ends. LVEB is much more powdery and fruity, while Flowerbomb is neither and has a better and stronger patchouli and a noticeable tea note. They're maybe cousins, but for sure not twins and not even sisters. Generally too many sweet fragrances get compared to LVEB when they don't smell alike at all. \n\nLVEB is the best seller of the last decade, loved by many, but also polarizing. At one point it was voted as the worst fragrance ever on fragrantica, which is funny to me. I understand that people are annoyed by its omnipresence or just don't like it, but it's hard to believe that someone really thinks this is THE worst smell that ever hit their nostrils. LVEB might be a victim of its own popularity sometimes.\nBut it's a modern classic. I look forward to 2035, when maybe perfume fans will rediscover good old LVEB in drugstores, like we now do with 90s designer fragrances.", "45": "This is a masterpiece and idc what anyone says about it being too popular or too mainstream. If anything, its popularity is an indication of how good it is. \n\nThe name says it all, La vie est belle which means life is beautiful. And indeed, whenever i wear this i jist feel happy.\nVery sweet, fun and carefree. I just love it.\n\nThe projection and lasting power are monstrous as you'd expect from Lancome. I love spraying it on my hair.\nThe bottle is very minimalistic and chic and the pink juice looks delicious lol.\n\n\nScent 9/10\nSillage 9/10\nStaying power 9/10\n\nPersonal rating 8.5/10", "46": "Is this perfume or ether? Hm. Either way, it could probably knock a bull to the ground if the bottle got smashed.  \n\nThat being said, the fragrance itself isn't that bad. Ok, it's terribly sweet and strong, and it does smell an awful lot like Flowerbomb, BUT, the difference for me is that I could never wear Flowerbomb. It smells awful on me. La Vie Est Belle I can actually wear. And it smells nice. \n\nLongevity: About 3 years. \nSillage: To Jupiters 67:th moon.", "47": "C'mon Lancome, Really???  This perfume is so unoriginal! It is so sugary sweet! It is so nondescript.  \n\nWhen I received a tiny sample I was certain on first sniff that THERE IS NO WOW FACTOR. There is the Snooze Factor, or actually, the toothache factor.\n\nI find it baffling that Julia Roberts is the spokesperson for this. She is not the warm fuzzy, over the top sweet type that this scent conveys.  She is serious, removed from Hollywood, no nonsense type. (gorgeous as she is, no doubt). To me, this gives off a more a sweet young uncomplicated thing vibe, like for example, Anna Faris?\n\nAnyway, just not my cup of tea. Surprised this is Lancome and surprised that it is so widely popular.  Glad I am not the only one with this mindset.\nQuel Dommage\u2026.", "48": "This seems to be such a polarizing fragrance! You either love it or hate it. I have worn it for years and found that on my skin the vanilla, orange blossom and patchouli notes really stand out.

I use this on occasion only. I do like it as it is beautiful. The sweetness of the praline is lovely and it is well balanced with the fruits, florals, vanilla and patchouli. I do not find it sickeningly sweet but delightful once in a while. It is not one of those ghetto fab princess sweet monstrosities that you get with some of the other sweet popular fragrances but a more mature \"Let me show you I'm a lady!\" type fragrance. I love Jimmy Choo as well but this is lighter than that. The floral notes are more pronounced in this. It is going to be a classic like Tresor no doubt.\n9/10"}, "31": {"0": "What happened to this!!!????? \nCmon Estee Lauder. You should be ashamed of yourselves.  \nThis was one of my first loves form the TF line, this, Tuscan Leather and Italian Cypress..  \nThis is not even close to that fragrance I bought all those years ago. This is just a cardamon and sichuan pepper bomb. There is no roundness, depth, warmth, no performance, NADA!!! Non of that charm and complexity we all loved in what seems like, a very long time ago.  \nBasically, the entire TF private line has gone to shit. The originals anyway. Dont get me started on what happened to Noir de Noir and Tuscan Leather. Ill lose my shit. No one was a bigger fan of those than me.  \nNow.... I have completely gone off TF. His new releases are a joke. What are they? They have no purpose. No direction. Just flavours in a bottle. Only saving graces are White Suede and Ombre Leather which has clearly superseded Tuscan Leather.  \nAlmond > Cherry > Peach. WTF????? Really. Get it together over there. Cheap and tacy perfumery at its worst. Especially from a powerhouse like TF. \nI hope someone at Estee Lauder reads this and reads it good. I'm sure I speak for thousands of TF enthusiasts out there on how disappointed and jaded they all are regarding TF these days; EL and TF are losing lots of love and $$$ and won't be getting any back. \nEspecially from me, a life long and loyal consumer of TF.....but not anymore.", "1": "I understand if you don't like Tom Ford. Elitist companies are a little bit gross in a world where most people are poor. But this is a fragrance forum. And this is a good fragrance. Perfect for the office or for any occasion where smelling nice is a good thing. If you buy this for me I will be your new boyfriend. Unless my girlfriend says I can\u2019t sell myself for a perfume. She\u2019s mean.", "2": "Oh my, with all due respect, I can't help but think that people who say this smells sharp and medicinal haven't smelled many oud perfumes. Tom Ford's is velvety smooth, probably the least medicinal of the ouds I've encountered. \nIt's a soft, creamy oud, heavy on amber, and sweetened with a bit of vanilla. What drives me bonkers about Oud Wood is the use of cardamom. How did Tom Ford know that cardamom is my weakness, lol?! \nThis perfume is mysterious and beautiful on me, but I would really enjoy the smell of Oud Wood on a sexy man as well!", "3": "I'm feeling a bit insecure when I am reviewing Oud Wood because there are a lot of fragrance experts with their poetic and great reviews here. But I got a 100ml bottle, and I have the right to review it right? Anyways, here's my comment about it- \nFirst things first, lets say how I first experienced it. My boyfriend was sweet enough to send me a little miniature of the fragrance (this is his signature scent). He's amazing isn't it? \nThe first impression of Oud Wood- I heard that oud is one of the most expensive perfume notes, and referred to as 'liquid gold'. As far as I am concerned, oud smells like rubber, its medicinal, woody, balsamic, Oriental and has many other facets (which I get all these accords in Oud Wood) \nThe notes of Oud Wood are all base notes and it starts straight away with a swift blast of oud. The notes seem to mix each other all up (maybe because they're all base notes?) but here are the most dominant notes for me - Oud (of course) stays throughout the composition. Then there is this rose-smelling accord (which must be the rosewood) which always gets the oud's back the whole time. The cardamom and Chinese pepper accords give a fresh and warm spicy tint and spices the component. The sandalwood and amber give it a cozy sweet Oriental warmth. The vetiver and tonka bean add to the woody-oriental composition and add aromatic nuances. At the very end of the life of the scent, oud still dominates but the gourmand vanilla and tonka bean drydown, and it gives a sweet ending of the scent, and I love this part the most. \nThe overall impression of the scent is that it is very unisex but personally I think it leans more on the masculine side. I can clearly see that it is unisex but it is a little too masculine for me to pull of, although I will wear it frequently and maybe then I will get its 'unisexual' (???) properties. We need to 'grow old' with Tom Ford scents to truly love them. The bottle is classy Tom Ford style, its very minimalistic but very sophisticated and luxurious in my collection. \nI really adore this scent, it's a very complimented perfume whenever I wear it, and they say I smell exactly like my boyfriend because we both have it and also love it. Both sexes always compliment me and the same thing happens to my bf too. \nOud Wood is what I would call an Oud skin scent. It is very Middle Eastern (don't trust me too much in that because I have quite a less experience on Middle Eastern perfumes). I really like the idea of an inoffensive Oud scent for the Western taste. The longevity does not satisfy me either (approx. 5 hours and a skin scent for several hours before it completely disappears) and a moderate sillage power. The potentiality of the scent is a bit poor for a Tom Ford scent but it is still worth the price for me. The only problem is that the scent is a little too masculine for my taste but I really wish I could pull it off. I would really appreciate it if you could help me by informing me with a scent so that I can layer it with this so that it becomes more unique and feminine. But it is just how wanted an oud scent to be for me because real Middle Eastern scents can be too much for me although they are the best quality scents with no doubt .

I've seen high-end oud retail for $1,500 for just 3ml (that's about enough to fill the cap of a water bottle.)  The price is only one problem to using real oud for corporate produced perfume.  The other problem with using real oud in mass produced perfume is finding uniformity and adequate supply.  Even farmed oud has variations from distillation to distillation.  Not to mention, farmed agarwood (Aquilaria) needed 12 years from planting before it produces a harvest.

This is the perfect blend of freshness and woodiness. Not so fresh that it's only a summer scent, and not so woody that it's only a fall scent. It blends the two together so that it's perfectly appropriate for either season. It elicits imagery of a clean shave followed by enjoying a day by the water. I want to wear this in the summer and fall; on special occasions and doing daily outdoor activities.\n\nOh, and I tried Versace Oud Noir to see if it's a good replacement for Tom Ford Oud Wood, and it absolutely is not.

This is something which I rarely have.\nI have been wearing this fragrance for hours now and it's still going strong.\nThis is a magnificent, slightly masculine, fresh, utterly addictive and high quality oud scent. \nI love oud in a fragrance, it makes the scent very airy and almost medicinal which appeals to me.  \nAlthough I love my powerhouse perfumes, there are some days where only oud will do and this perfume is perfect for those days.\nThis is a true Chypre to my nose, lots of moss, wood and spices but make no mistake that this is a high quality, high end fragrance.  Do I think it's worth \u00a3300 a bottle? Well yes, if that's what rocks your boat. Here in the perfume world everything is subjective and I truly believe that one man's meat is another man's poison.\nTo conclude, this is a ravishingly beautiful oud perfume which has moderate silage and on me, pretty good longevity.

Just because you're buying the brown bottle doesn't necessarily mean you will get the same juice that you smelled when it was first released.\n\nThe original 2007 release of this fragrance is perhaps the most divine concoction ever created. The main difference between this and the others is the strong presence of brazilian rosewood, giving it a sweetness that is reminiscent of NDN.\n\nIt's a shame to see so many people praising the most recent formulation (grey bottle) which IMO is by far the most boring version of this juice. Yes it may be stronger and slightly more masculine, but the magic simply isn't there anymore. It's still a nice fragrance but doesn't justify the hefty price tag, and the synthetic replacements are too noticeable.\n\nBack to '07... The opening is strong, rich and smooth. I smell Oud and brazilian rosewood, followed by a soft vanilla that blends everything together masterfully. The 30 minute mark is where the magic really happens.\n\nThis is so classy and elegant it literally stops people in their tracks. Strength is perfect, not too loud yet always present. I smell it in all my clothes and it seems to stay with me forever (even though my bottle is now almost 9 years old).\n\nWhile the reformulation smells similar, it doesn't compare to the masterpiece that Tom Ford originally released.\n\nIf I could only wear one fragrance for the rest of my life, this would be it without a doubt.

I guess what some reviewers may not realize about very high quality fragrances like this is that less is more. I'm sure this was not designed to make you show off in front of other people. When I wear it, it just feels like it emanates naturally from my within my own skin, not as if it was applied onto it. It's just like second (very pleasant) nature, part of my own private smellscape, not necessarily shared with others, only those within a certain physical proximity. Feeling distinguished and exquisite in that way is what luxury is all about.", "22": "If you always look presentable and want something effortless, elegant and classy to compliment you then this is for you.

I find this is more of a cold weather oud. \n\nThe silage is buildable meaning it's perfect for the office or you can build up the intensity for a black tie event. This is definitely a skin fragrance so the trick to this gem for ultimate lasting power is when you spray on your hair and on your pulse points. TF creates such VERSATILE fragrances once you find what works for you in his fragrance line. It's an EDGY fragrance that's still so smooth.

Each evening I would stop by a particularly well-stocked profumeria and select a fragrance to sample for the day. \nIt was a crisp fall day, and I remember standing on a bus some time after spraying Oud Wood on my wrist, thinking somebody smelled amazing. I kept getting whiffs of something woody and mysterious, light and playful. A few stops later the smell was still there and I realized it was me. Though I usually try not to smell myself too much, I could not help but sneak furtive sniffs the rest of the night.\nBeing young and without means, the next day I went to a different perfume shop to sample Oud Wood again without feeling pressure to purchase. Again I was struck by the beauty of it.\nSince then time has passed, and I am no longer in Rome. Feeling sentimental, I ordered a sample and waited in anticipation for that smell I loved so much. Sadly, when I sprayed the sample, it simply was not the same. At first I wondered if it was just my sentimentality getting in the way, but the more I have sprayed it the past few weeks, the more I am convinced the magic is lost.\nThe scent now is similar, but it feels more transparent. I think the beauty of it came in the richness it once had - too opaque to smell all the way through - and therefore mysterious. Now, it is sheer, and while nice, rather ordinary. Whereas I once smelled sweet woods (not oud, but definitely wood), I now get something more akin to dark cherry cola. \nAlas.", "25": "Awesome scent. It's classy and can be casual as well. Not for hot weather though.

I have tested a few others today- and man, people saying this are terribly wrong!\n\nOud Wood is a wonderful, woody scent. Its quality is amazing- it smells so deep and mysterious. Like all the others from the line, it is very intense. the wood smells as if it lied down in the sun for a long time- the hot surface, saw dust vibrating in your nostrils, blazing heat. that is what you get at first- as it dries down, you get some beautiful vetiver and vanilla, sort, sensual, yet still upholding he original dryness. This is not Tobacco Vanille's boozy, sweet vanilla- it is darker and more mature.\n\nI see it on a man more than on a woman, somehow", "27": "I tried this on the advise of another fragrantician. \n\nStunning!

After reading a lot of reviews stating this has been watered down and is a long shot from what it used to be, I can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s just olfactory fatigue people are experiencing. Initially, I thought this stuff was pretty weak but I think it\u2019s just difficult to detect after about an hour. After many wearings I have found this to be much more potent than I originally thought.\n\nI have the newer bottle with the grey label and I can honestly say that it performs VERY well.

The only other \"oud\" fragrance I own is YSL La collection M7 Absolu and I gotta say I never liked this oud fragrance, I have worn it maybe 6 times and I have purchased it when it came out because I was trying to understand the original M7 hype through this reformulation of it (I got into the \"fragrance game\" only after M7 was discontinued).\n\nI have read a ton of reviews about TF OW and finally I decided to pull the trigger, bought it blindly for not cheap really. And I've got to say, this is a completely different league than the above mentioned M7 OA. I absolutely love this one, it just smells so good. I'm not a huge fan of the opening but after the strong, initial oud notes pass, I think this frag is beautiful.\n\nI also own the gray bottle version and I don't think its performance is weak, when I read reviews that state that \"it is a shadow of it old self\" or that \"it is watered down and destroyed by the reformulation\" I always actually cringe. It's not '80s anymore, people are not smoking in airplanes and it is not cool to let the whole boulevard know that today is the day you wear fragrances, you don't need to have scents with atomic sillage and projection anymore. If this was any stronger I'd spend 10 minutes each day at the office waiting so that I can step in the elevator alone, just not to choke everyone inside. Please calm down people, seriously.\n\nI let my friend who is absolutely not a frag head wear this for a couple of days, his old signature scent was something cheap by Hugo Boss, I don't really recall the name. Of all of my collection including Aventus, GIT, Musc Ravageur, Aqua Universalis as well as a ton of designers, he said that he loved TF OU most since it was smelling really good, and he never smelled anything like it in his entire life. It's not fruity, it's not citrusy, it's just its own thing.\n\nFor me this is 9/10 and I'm taking that point down since I'm not a huge oud fan and I don't like the opening all that much. That being said, if you can afford it or if you can sample/decant it, I really hope you will because there is a good chance that you will enjoy it that one point more than me and it will be a masterpiece for you.", "33": "Incredible smell, poor performance.\n\nThe scent is a masterpiece, so calming, elegant, yes even enchanting. Its such a shame that the performance is so poor. Only 2-3 hours and it is completly gone! Its like having a Ferrari, but no gasoline to drive it.\n\nI want to smell like oud wood long and strong. To deal with the performance, I bought oud wood body lotion to add into the mix. Hoping for a good smelling and meditative everyday life.\n\nIf this had better performance, it has been the best scent of all time. I just dont understand why masterparfumers and a house like Tom Ford dont make it last? They have the knowledge and there is nothing holding them back to create a beast mode scent. Even the ingredients in oud wood are typical long lasting notes and not a citrus composition. No, its various woods, its vanilla, its amber! Oud wood has potential to be a anabolic beast, but instead they created a little baby. I just dont understand why they dont make it last longer! I also expect it for the high price. \n\nIf you want a cheap alternative, Tom Oudh oil from surrati is suprisingly similar, it has better performance and costs 6 dollars.

This for me is just so smooth and creamy. I think its just me,but in the mid, there is just a minute hint of like a sweet raspberry. Just a faint whiff before it dries down. Maybe Im crazy, I dont know. On my skin this lasts FOREVER. Im talking 10 hours I can still smell it on myself and it leave trails. My girlfriend goes absolutely nuts for it.

It sits on my shelf as a wild child and spends the day thumbing its nose at my heavy floral orientals and chypres.

I received a decant from one of my friends here and HAD to have a full bottle immediately. So many of my other friends, etc. have been turned on to this fantastic woody fragrance. When I wear it (only in cooler temperatures), I get a somewhat powdery aspect to it when blended with the lovely woods chosen complete the perfection of Oud Wood. I suppose it's a combination of the sandalwood and tonka bean that create the soft powder accord that brings me back to reaching for this again and again. Oh....I am female by the way - AND - I have some unisex fragrances that lean more toward the masculine side, but the majority of my fragrances are very floral and (what I consider) very feminine. This, Amber Absolute, Sacred Wood......and and and.......they grab me and won't let go! So, ladies, don't let the wood heavy notes scare you from trying this magnificent fragrance. Most of you will fall head over heels :o) \n\nPS: I have glanced at a few reviews from 2011 and saw many saying it was \"sharp\" \"medicinal\" and other words that completely left me perplexed.

Just saying. \nTF Oud Wood is stunningly elegant and magnetic masculine oud fragrance out there which can be worn by both sexes, depends on your own preferences and body chemistry, naturally, who are we to tell you what to wear?\nIn addition to oud wood and rosewood I have detected a hint of stimulating pine needles in it. It might be down to olfactory complexity of oud wood... This is a very masculine combination anyway.  It could be a wonderful frag for a woman who wants to feel a bit strong, masculine and sterile. It has a cold vibe to it, though all modern frags and old re-formulated ones have it.  I didn't buy it, it was a present, I love it, but I rarely reach for it, way too masculine for my taste, yet the elegance and refinement are there, no doubt.", "42": "Sublime scent, what I find interesting is that most people claim to smell no oud in this. I have some oud chips from Cambodia that I burn on a mica plate that smells very similar to oud wood.", "43": "Oud Wood is a perfect work scent, and would be a great choice for a signature scent (if you have the money).  \n\nI\u2019ve been delving into niche and luxury designer scents recently, so naturally I had to buy a decant of Oud Wood.  The first spray I applied to my wrist, and I was met with the smell of chlorine/Clorox that a couple reviewers mentioned.  Beneath that smell was a pleasant transparent wood.  Also I now understand the meaning of what some reviewers describe as a watery note.  I initially had mixed feelings because I loved the woody note and watery transparent character, but was off put by the Clorox smell.  After an hour the chlorine note toned down, and deeper in the dry down the amber and vanilla became noticeable.  This added a subtle sweetness to the fragrance. And after a couple hours I really liked it. \n\nThe second wearing I applied two sprays to my neck.  What a difference the location made.  The chlorine note was now more of a fresh clean metallic note...much more pleasant. Smelling it up close on my first wearing was the problem, whereas smelling the sillage projecting from my neck was an altogether different experience.   I\u2019m not sure if the chlorine note is the oud, but whatever it is,I think this is what adds its watery clean vibe. \n\nThe sillage is beautiful, sophisticated, and unique.  It doesn\u2019t fill a room, but it projects enough to be noticed.  It\u2019s light and transparent, rather than being heavy and dense.  That makes it a great choice for work. I normally reapply at lunch with my fragrances, so if a scent can project a couple feet for 5 hours I\u2019m happy.  Oud Wood accomplishes this; it lasts 12 hours on my skin and consistently projects about 1-2 feet for over 6 hours.  I don\u2019t know if this contains and Iso-E Super, but it behaves like Iso-E does.  After wearing it for 10 hrs I thought it was only a skin scent, then I moved my arm and could detect the sillage from my wrist that was two feet away. \n\nOud Wood is a perfect choice for the office because it is unique, non-offensive, transparent, long lasting, sophisticated, and could be worn year round. It\u2019s probably the next fragrance I\u2019m going to buy.  I give it a 9/10...but the more I wear it the more I love it so it may become a 10/10.", "44": "Oud Wood - Subtle Masterpiece\n\nWill be straight to the point- I love this gem of a creation!\nCreamy, delicious (non gourmand-ic way) woody oud, it is no surprise why this is one of Ford's bestsellers. I'm sure the moment they smelled it for the first time, huge piles of cash must have flashed before their eyes, knowing the quality of the scent along with the TF name associated with it :)\n\nThis is imo, one of the most refined and elegant oud based scents, without having any of the skank or darkness of other oud scents. Mr Ford just does it perfect with this one, a beautiful rendition of the wood, different from what countless others have started releasing.\n\nIt felt like a milky, exotic wood with a silky finish to it. It doesn't feel thick, as it maintains an airiness about it.. like a transparent veil around you, always there   yet doesn't obscure vision.\nThere is a certain \"yummy\" vibe to it, which is what I think is due to the combination of vanilla and sandalwood.. a non gourmandish way of being yummy.\n\nIn terms of color, I personally imagine a beige/faint walnut brown shade when I smell Oud Wood. \n\nPerformance wise, this sits close to skin and maintains a small scent bubble throughout, and lasts for quite a while (8 Hours).\n\nBrilliant scent, with medium-good performance, this one stays in my favorites-list.", "45": "There is almost a suede-ish opening to Oud Wood, but from there it quickly transitions to beautifully polished daek wood like you would find in some kind of old library or study.\nIt is clean oud wood, i don't find anything \"dirty\" here, but what i do find is age. This scent feels like it was discovered in a flacon hidden away for centuries and over that time all the ingredients blended together that you can no longer distinguish individual notes, or maybe it is vecause i have a poorly developed nose.\nThe vetiver, cardamom and amber actually lend a sense of airyness to this that prevents it from getting heavy and i dont really get much sichuan pepper or vanilla. It is an ancient, distinguished scent and in my opinion the best in the private blend series.", "46": "I was THRILLED to get my hands on some of the original GOLD LABEL Oud Wood (2007 formula) and it's is, indeed a magnificent fragrance that's sadly been almost ruined thru reformulation. The new one, with the grey label,just isn't what it used to be. Still lovely in scent, the value for your dollar, is terrible. It's just TOO WEAK and that's not good enough for $320/50ml.\nWould I buy it when my gold label decant runs out? I doubt it.  \nWhat I have done and am really enjoying is using a oil dupe, you know the kind you see on eBay for $10 a 5ml bottle. There's a few around that are fantastic copies that you can actually detect on yourself all day.\nIf you can't find the gold label Oud Wood, (which is a tall order ) buy the oil dupe and save yourself a few hundred dollars. ( first time I've suggested using a copy in oil base here with my reviews) but side by side, the oil wins out by miles, when you consider value for money.\nI love to spray fragrance but you can add alcohol or witchhazel to oil and make it more fluent)\nSeriously,  $320 for a 50ml bottle of weak and poor performing perfume, is disgraceful Mr Ford. \nI love you TF, but come back down to earth please!  \nResurrect this back to its intended and magical glory, and what you have is simply stunning. \nFor men and women. It's the bomb!\nIt's one fragrance that holds a very special place in my heart because it makes me feel so wonderful! Reminding me of my excitement when first finding these stunning perfumes, it just brings me pure joy!  \nAlthough this review is somewhat negative in due to reformulation, this, in my opinion, is one of the greatest scents I've come across. \nThe only down side is in regard to the reformulations, because I initially fell in love with the original formula, I'm just saddened that other people can't get it the way it should be....\nYou know what I mean? Anyone who's been upset by reformulations and crave their beloved fragrances how they were, will totally get where I'm coming from.\nOud Wood blows my mind and makes me smile, and all of a sudden, I become more confident and joyful when I wear it.  \nOud Wood layers very well with most scents I've noticed. Patchouli and oud wood together smell amazing!\n\nIt 'saved' my day today with uplifting my spirit.\n\nScent. 8.5/10\nLongevity 5/10\nPerformance 5/10.

I wanted to bury my face in my arm after smelling this. At first spray I thought, this is something I could wear as a very feminine woman who loves wood notes but as the dry down continued I distinctly smelled MAN. A man who cares about where he\u2019s going, knows what he wants and carries himself with impeccable stride. This is a man who uses beard oil, wears tailored slacks casually, cleans his hiking boots. This is a beautiful man. That\u2019s all.", "49": "I got a small sample from Sephora and I fell in love with it! Entranced and seduced by it! It smells dark, oriental, seductive, sexy and expensive! Picture a hunky Asian guy with dark green eyes in tuxedo. LoL. And picture that guy is approaching you slowly yet decisively with those seductive eyes. Then imagine you're taking a walk in a dark forest with that guy. That's pretty much what goes through my mind when I smell this perfume. Sorry if I sound like a maniac.\n\nI want it!

I am seeing here that many people are complaining about the longevity. So here is the solution guys.  \nFirst of all use jojoba oil contents (I am using the palmolive ones) for both hair and body shampoo. After finishing shower you should put PURE jojoba oil with some cotton just to your neck area and wait 15 minutes to dry a little. After that you can spray your magic.  \nHow to spray:\nDon't think that owerspraying will increse the longevity. (even it's transforming to a terrible scent.) \nSpray it to different parts of your neck area from FAR away and especially close to your hair area.   \nThe most important part:\nAfter doing everything you said 'no nothing happened' 'still no longevity' etc..I understand you but don't give up. All you need is time. You should adapt your body for to be moisturized. I tested and for my VERY DRY skin I needed minimum 15 days. But finally it worked! So if you are complaining for longevity issues for any scent you should apply JOJOBA oil. This is very impotant...  \nResults;\n9 hours.......... I make the test everyday......\nFirst 3 hours very good projection and longevity.\n4-5 hours you get decent projection and longevity.\nAfter that it becomes to a skin scent with some jojoba oil. smell.\nThen scent turns to a secret weapon... If you are on a date, you will understand what i mean.;)  \nFrom a fragrance what you can need more? 9 hour is more than enough for everything...  \nJust a quick note:\nTo understand how amazing the scent:\nHold your breath for 10 seconds and then spray it your neck.\nSmell gently.\nNot joking! uh?!   \nThanks a lot D&G for creating such a beauty.  \nThanks for reading!", "1": "I'll keep this short and sweet. It smells amazing, women love it, it's a more refined version of the EdT, it still has the crappy performance of the EdT.  \nI honestly think they called this fragrance \"The One\" because that's how many hours it lasts. I love this fragrance but I was disappointed that the EDP did not seem to solve the performance issues of the Edt....At least on my skin.", "2": "The most original and delightful scent I've sniffed in years.  \nAnd that is not an easy combination to find, let me tell you. You can find stuff that smells like nothing else you've ever smelled (Xeryus Rogue, Givenchy) but it smells like an old Christmas tree mixed with cheap potpourri. The One is very original, and smelling it you just can't get enough.  \nPeople are too harsh on the performance, but I believe this isn't meant to be a powerhouse scent, nor should it be. There are other perfumes for when you want to be smelled from across a room (Spicebomb, Xeryus Rogue, One Million). But if you just want people close to you to enjoy being close, The One is a perfect option. You can always respray.  \nMost, if not all the reviews I read say this is a cold time scent, but I disagree completely. The fruitiness of the scent makes it perfect for a spring or summer day, although not a pool party type occasion. As it dries down, the tobacco and wood become more evident, and this is why most people say it is for use in the cold, but like I said, you can always re apply and get that fruitiness/freshness again, and the wood/tobacco definetely retain a touch of the ginger, so, I'm definetely using it this spring/summer.  \nAmazing piece of art.", "3": "Why do people complain about performance when it's a date night scent?

I bought it recently, as soon as it was available in my local store, and it fulfilled all expectations. \nIt's a bit richer, more spicier than the EDT, lasts 1-2h longer, projects just the way it should, and of course the scent itself is heavenly! I still have to encounter someone who doesn't like this scent, it garners compliments everywhere. This belongs in my top5 for fall/winter. Olivier Polge delivered another master piece, excellent work !", "6": "This is one of my all time favorites, and that's not a function of hype, marketing, Matthew McConaughey, etc.  It just suits me, and women love it.  My most recent compliment came after a hug - she said \"Oh God, you smell PHENOMENAL!\"\n\nAdmittedly, this one took a while to grow on me. On a new bottle , the grapefruit and other sour elements were a little much - it took me some time to place what the scent reminded me of, but it finally dawned on me - chicken wings with bleu cheese dressing (call me crazy, go ahead, I can take it.)  But I find that if you spray out 20 or so sprays from a new bottle of any perfume, that little bit of \"airing out\" of the bottle does wonders.  Now I love it. \n\nLastly, and most importantly, I feel compelled to address the issue of longevity/ projection with this perfume, as both are roundly bashed as being sub par....\n\nNot all sprayers are created equal. For example, my Chanel sprayers blast out so much perfume I have to steady myself as to not be blown off my feet. Same with Dior Homme, le Male, and a few others that spray out like fire extinguishers.\n\nNo so with D&G The One (and John Varvatos fragrances, which also have light sprayers, but I digress....)  The sprayer emits a relatively small amount of perfume.  My unscientific estimate is that, in terms of volume,  5 or 6 sprays of The One equals 1 spray my Pour Monsieur Concentree or Antaeus.  You want more projection/ longevity from it? Then hit that sprayer homie. \n\nIn short, this is modern masterpiece from one of the best in the biz, one of my two perfumes that I call \"fall in a bottle\" , the other being Zino by Davidoff.", "7": "We already have it in the store.\n\nSince I am not a huge fan of the original, I did not have any expectations about it at all. In fact, it was sitting on the shelf for about 1 week and I decided to try it today. So, no, I wasn't that enthusiastic about it.\n\nHowever, I must admit, I like this one. Maybe I even love it. Can't decide yet. But I really like that tobacco/ginger accord on that huge amber base. It has also a really good performance too. Much much better than the EDT but the smell itself is too close to it. Not too sweet, not too spicy this perfume achieves perfect harmony from it's ingredients and The One EDP is easily the best offering from D&G in recent history in the men's perfume department.\n\nAll in all, it may grow on me, it may not.

I always loved the original The One scentwise, like, a lot. But as you well know, the performance was really an issue. That's why it's not in my collection. So, i think for most of us an EDP version of this would be like a dream came true, right? So there it was, found it in a duty free shop 2 days ago and i have to say that when i saw the bottle i got excited as a 10 year old seeing an awesome toy car or any other cool toy. Applied 3 full sprays on my wrist and 2 more on paper to take home with me for a detailed impression. Well, scentwise it's not really much to say about it, it not really deeper or darker than the original, in fact in the opening i get a lot more grapefruit than the original. It doesn't take long for the scent to became identical with the original.\n Anyway, let's get to the important part, the performance!\nAs expected, as most of the EDP fragrances for men, the sillage it's not really impressive, it's below average. It's an intimate sillage, noticeable in small rooms, or cuddling with your girlfriend or hugging with someone. But compared with the original, this is definitely an improvement. As for longevity, well, i have to say that this one really lasts, although sits close to skin, it's still there for several hours and still noticeable.\n\n Overall, it's a decent improvement from the original, not spectacular, but it's good. I was with my girlfriend when i tried this, and she loved it a lot. She said i should buy it soon, so i guess this will be in my collection soon, although the overall performance it's moderate, and i usually enjoy heavier fragrances, for this one i think i will make an exception because it's an amazing fragrance and the performance it's not that frustrating as with the original. \n Some final ratings on this one:\nScent: 9/10\nPerformance: 6.5/10", "15": "One of the best date night fragrances ever.

People only rip on the performance but if you spray your shirt or jacket it will last 12 hours. I usually wear hoodies 3-4 times before washing and if I wear one a few times and spray The One EDP every time I wear it I will still smell it days later. For work I spray the shirt the night before and morning off and catch whiffs all day long. If I spray my night shirt after a shower I still smell it the next morning. And that\u2019s on two different batches of the stuff.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. People in the frag community are hooked on arms length projection for 10 hours off your skin, but that\u2019s not what this was designed to do.

Fantastic juice.", "19": "A lesson learnt the hard way.\n\nDon't believe the hype. \nBought this based on all the hype from YouTubers. It's a nice opening but don't be fooled, it stays very light and then disappears in a couple of hours. Not what I wanted for a office/work scent. It's a close encounter scent. May stay around better on clothes but fleeting on the skin almost minutes after applying. I personally have to reapply every 3 hours.\n\nFor the price  ($60 AUD -50ml ) you could get many better performers out there.\n\n Not sure why it's not compared more but I own Mont Blanc legend nite EDP which is very similar in the drydown. MB whilst still being a close encounter scent is more full bodied and performs much better and keeps some Johnny cash in yo pocket.\n\nThis will be a miss personally in the future. \nScent 7.5/10 - nice smelling - slightly sweet tobacco opening with some cardomom. What you don't hear in the reviews is the tobacco only sticks around for the opening and is gone in an hourish...\nPerformance 4/10 - subpar on my skin \nI actually think the best part is the actual bottle lol", "20": "In 2015, Dolce&Gabbana released this; I think their undisputed masterpiece: The One for Men Eau de Parfum. A fragrance so complex, most people probably don\u2019t take the time to pick out all the notes. But they should because it\u2019s not just about evoking sexuality and the emotions of intimacy; it\u2019s also a personal statement about the perfumer itself.\n\nThe tobacco really punches through in this fragrance while managing not to be overpowering, as the amber is there to meld with it in a way that really mellows it out into a much more tasteful aroma. The Grapefruit occasionally interplays with both of those notes to create a very sophisticated profile. After about an hour and a half, I can detect the orange blossom & ginger notes as well while the tobacco moves to the center stage.\n\nI\u2019d say this kind of hyper-masculine profile could be a bit overwhelming to some, but after the initial spray the sillage is a bit closer to the vest. If you\u2019re looking to project a bit you can always spray more. With that said, even with three sprays Evelyn Williams, my supposed fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t stop buzzing in my ear.\n\nAs far as longevity is concerned; others seem to suggest this fragrance doesn\u2019t perform. I tend to agree in the sense that it won\u2019t be as pronounced after about 4 hours, but that\u2019s a positive in my book, as it becomes more of a skin-scent by then for closer\u2026 interactions without being a distraction.\n\nI can say without a doubt this is one of the best intimate evenings, date night, or candle lit dinner fragrances for its price. It is evocative of the feelings of mystery, romance, desire, and sensuality. \n\nThis fragrance is killer for what it\u2019s meant to be and at an incredible price point. 9.6\n\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve a matinee of Le Miz, listen I\u2019ve really gotta go.

I found that doubling or tripling the sprays at each spot is a good way to improve the performance (your skin is left with a higher concentration of essential oils on it), since the provided atomizer doesn't release too much juice.\n\nIn my opinion you can wear it whatever the season and the time, but it gives its best at night.

Spring nights would be still ok if you ask me. The best time to wear it would be fall, maybe even winter but it doesn't have the power to survive winter time in my opinion.\n\nScent: 9,5/10\nCompliments: 9/10\nVersatitlity: 8/10\nPerformance: 6,5/10 (it's a pity) - but don't think performance sucks, it's still solid but not a beast which we (fragrance enthusiasts) want\n\nNothing should be changed about this fragrance. Only its performance. :)", "41": "Yup, still amazing.  This is perfect the way it is, not too strong, just a beautiful, clean, warm tobacco.  Amber with a fresh tartness coming from the grapefruit and basil with some spice coming from the ginger and coriander, smoothened out with cedar...  Just a culinary masterpiece of perfumery.   A cocoon of seduction.  I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.", "42": "Finally got my hands on this and while it's a bit redundant, it's not totally. Being one of my favorite scents, I needed a little more out of the EDT. Even if to justify the price tag.\n\nThe scent is identical to the EDT version, at least to my nose. There's nothing particularly new here.\n\nLongevity was much better for me. I got about 8 hours. Not what I normally think for an EDP but for The One, that seems like a marked improvement. The sillage is a little better but not the improvement the longevity is. Overall, I'm happy with it.", "43": "I own many fragrances ranging designer to niche, this is my number one choice for the fall and winter months. I'm almost confident that if I'd smelled this in the beginning of my frag journey, this would have kept me at the two bottle \"one for hot one for cold\" status. \n\nPerformance on this is excellent in my opinion. It's so soft and subtle that 5 sprays is perfect for intimate settings,  work, meetings, church, or just daily runs. Yet rich enough that you can where it to an event or an night out on the town just by upping the sprays to 8. Trust me it work, the performance is beefed up and the ladies love it. \n\nA 10/10 fragrance that is easily accessible and affordable, yeah I'll take it any day.", "44": "A beautiful fragrance and in my opinion one of the greatest scents that ever created! A signature scent for a lot of us, so warm and cosy. Everybody knows it and likes it! It's better for the cooler weather and you can wear it all year except summer.\n\nI had the EDT about 10 years ago when it first launched and i loved it. EDT's performance is weak but the EDP concetration is better but still not great. I would say average performance and projection.\n\nI think \"the one\" is one of the must have pieces of a fragrance collection!", "45": "Probably one of the best scents ever.

The opening is fresh, dark, bold, unique, and inviting. The grapefruit, cardamom, ginger, and tobacco are the opening most noticeable notes. The grapefruit is a passing visitor, its bitter and citrus notes are noticeable for just a brief moment adding a fresh touch to the fragrance. But this sparkly note will soon take a more discrete place. The tobacco, cardamom, ginger, and amber grow very quickly and take the lead of the fragrance; the tobacco in this fragrance is a rich, warm, smokey, and dark note, evocative of black cigar tobacco; the ginger and cardamom are equally noticeable, they both create a sharp, fresh, resinous, bitter and spicy accord. The amber is the last of the featured notes, this note presents itself as dry, sweet, and resinous. The rest of the notes, the orange blossom, and cedar are there just to provide support, a faint floral and woody touch in the far back of fragrance. The fragrance has a simple but noticeable opening to dry down transition, the opening favors the fresh, and bitter grapefruit, the fragrance feels moist; then the grapefruit recedes, the fragrance becomes dry, and the tobacco, amber, and spices take the top position. Once Dolce & Gabbana The One EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, mildly sweet, resinous, amber, dark tobacco, spicy, ginger, and cardamom fragrance with woody and faint white floral accords. The fragrance feels bitter, bold, casual, dark, dense, dry, elegant, formal, gentle, masculine, mild, moderate-quality, modern, nocturnal, resinous, smoky, sweet, warm, woody, and pleasant.\n\nBATCH REVIEWED: 2020 (#9022MM).\nWOW RATING: 8/10. A good, sweet, tobacco, and spicy fragrance.\nDISLIKE RATING: 1/10. The tobacco is noticeable but inoffensive.\nUNIQUENESS: 8/10. A relatively unique fragrance.\nMASS APPEAL: 8/10. The sweet tobacco will please most.\nPROJECTION: 3/10. Low, about 3 feet around the wearer.\nSILLAGE: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet behind the wearer.\nAPPLICATION: 6 atomizations.\nLONGEVITY: 4/10.

This is an office-friendly fragrance.\nVERSATILITY: 7/10. A good fragrance for mild or cold weather, or nighttime wear.\nGENDER: Masculine, the tobacco leans the fragrance to the masculine side.\nAGES: Any.\nRECOMMENDATION: Dolce & Gabbana The One EDP can be purchased for about $60.

You don't choose HP it chooses you! \nI got recommended this first time by a pregnant sales girl (thank you!) and she said it smells like delicious birthday cake! So I sprayed, and oh yeah it was cake alright, but why on earth do you want to smell like cake? So you can be eaten alive? Cheers! \nSo for the longest time I thought HP is the worst thing I can put on myself. Shopping in department store once found a friggin sample of HP in bag (thank you Dior counter lady) and I started carrying it around spraying my friends with it, because I thought it was funny, ok? None of my friends liked it, said \"the smell gave them a mini panic attack\". \nI started spraying myself with HP at some point. Don't know why I did that if I hated it so much. The little vial lasted me so long, and eventually ran out. Didn't know until shopping at the mall once and told everyone I need to go to bathroom while in fact I ran to Dior counter to spray HP on myself. Just felt that I need that rush of sweetness down my nose so I can keep going! It's like you have a long flight and anxiously waiting for that first cigarette once you get off the airplane. I was so disappointed at myself when I finally bought a bottle. Think I have been Hypnotic Poisoned? \nSometimes I stare at my HP bottle and thinking, you evil little shit.\nand the bottle stares me back in its victory.", "1": "First of all, I just want to say how much I love reading all the reviews for hypnotic poison. You guys have all so eloquently described this scent. If I had to choose a signature, it would be this. (I've probably said that about all my 'loves' but I mean it with this one!) \nWhat makes this scent stand out for me, is the sheer deepness of the smell. Right now, I am wearing Mon Guerlain, and while I like it, I am craving hypnotic posion. I am missing the way HP has no sharp edges or high notes. The perfume I am wearing at this second has 'high' notes. HP is lowdown low all of the way. There is nothing sharp or high-pitched about it. Because of this, it gives the illusion of being a skin scent, pretending that it doesn't project. As a result, I find it can sometimes 'fly under the radar' of my nose due to the lack of high notes, but then, wham! If you over apply it sneaks up on you and tries to suffocate you. \nThis perfume is unique because most gourmands are sweet 'because of' those high, fruity, sugary notes. This one manages to be sweet but it doesn't smell remotely like candy. It is deep, and I guess that's one of the reasons why it's got the vaguely gothic reputation despite the fact it is a gourmand. It is also a perfume of contrasts. I know you lovely people have said it many times, but it bears repeating. The bottle is the poisoned apple from Snow White. The vanilla, coconut and hint of deep fruits make it edible. But the almond, or, more specifically, the cyanide from the almonds makes it dangerous and deadly. It makes your mouth water, yet it would kill you if consumed. It is a perfect and magical juxtaposition. I love this stuff above all others.", "2": "I still can remember that feeling when my boyfriend\u00b4s mom put her cashmere scarf over my shoulders /because I was cold/ - and my whole soul was filled up with the scent of mild & sweet vanilla, gourmand almonds, bittersweet apricot kernels & coconut milk. Since then I\u00b4ve known this fragrance is absolutely perfect for cold & bad weather - it keeps you warm & makes you feel comfortable.", "3": "My wife wore this when we first met 16 years ago, I knew or cared nothing for fine fragrance at the time and she still brings up that I said \"it smells like play-doh\"... Fast forward through the years and this fragrance represents every argument about pure carnal lust and sexual promise to a man. This. Fragrance. Is. Horny. It's Desire, a sensual, dusky siren with long raven hair and full, sexy hips. Monica Bellucci in TheMatrixReloaded, Salma Hayek dancing on the table in FromDuskTilDawn. This fragrance is for a confident woman with class who does not question her own actions. She knows her decisions are the right choices and everybody knows she has reached her decision eloquently and fairly. \nBut of course I'm very bias and maybe different circumstances surrounding my introduction to this fragrance would have a very different reaction. I think it is one of the fragrances that got it just right. For me. Excellent projection and diffusion, hold and longevity. My wife loves it anyway and I always try to get her to save it for special occasions just because it has such a, ... well... 'Hypnotic' effect on me(I also get a similar effect from PRADA Amber, but Amber requires patience before it reveals that soft, tangy, vanillin 'heat' that is much more carnal and brutally passionate than Hypnotic Poison).\nHypnotic Poison for the seduction, Amber for the act.", "4": "Some of the fun of Fragrantica is re-acquainting with perfumes from your past and sharing your journey back to them.  \nSince scent and memory are closely tied, I remember experiencing Hypnotic Poison for the first time. I was roughly 10 or 11 and in my aunt's room playing with a sample size vial. I remember thinking how strong her other aldehydic perfumes were to my young nose (although I'm sure I didn't know the word \"aldehyde\" yet!) and yet this spritz from a little black and red vial had captivated me.  \nIt was strong. It was creamy. It was floral. It was magical.  \nI glanced at the words printed on it. \"Hypnotic Poison.\" \nGrowing up in a deeply religious household I almost felt it was sinful to wear a perfume with such a naughty name! I didn't know what to feel except that this new scent I was in love with had a terrible name. I didn't want to spray on poison! ;) \nFast forward to my late teens, my first time in a Sephora, seeing this deep red \"apple\" flacon luring me in. I knew right away this had to be the potion from my childhood that scared me with its name but delighted me with its scent. I spritzed it on nearly every time afterwards, but the price tag and heaviness of the scent when I was using body sprays was just too much to commit to.  \nI've finally purchased a full size bottle for myself, after my secret love affair for this scent carried on from childhood to late teens to late twenties. As a grown woman, the power of the scent, its sillage and the namesake have all been owned with its purchase.  \nHypnotic Poison is a dreamy and otherworldly plummy jasmine almond paste with the occasional waft of root beer or play doh. Other times it is creamy nearly indolic fruits and flowers. It is quite tantalizing to the senses. Warm. Alluring. Unconventionally beautiful. I have to say it never smells quite the same on me and I enjoy that.  \nIt will always have a spot on my dresser and in my heart.", "5": "A stranger stood next to me in a club once, started inching closer and closer, and then asked \"What's that perfume you're wearing?\"\n\n\"Hypnotic Poison\", I replied.\n\nHe smiled knowingly and said \"That makes sense...\"", "6": "THIS is the most precious, perfect, velvety cloud of vanilla. I've never tried the old version, so I can't compare it, but the sillage is perfect to me. It's present all day, without being too loud. I really don't like tuberose, but in hypnotic poison it works. It isn't too noticeable but it lingers in the background and gives it a mysterious exotic vibe. perfect! It gives me the opportunity to travel in my mind when  I can't travel in real life. \n\nI understand that this might not be the perfect fit for everyone, but I hope everyone finds the perfume that does what this does for me. It gives me goosebumps and butterflies, changes the way i view life, and how I take on my day. It gives me strength and wraps me in an ever present, gentle cloud of perfect.  And this is why I love perfumes!", "7": "I live in a very hot county, so I was worried about buying this. Needless to say my obsession got the better of me. I could hardly wait, as I sat in my smolderingly hot car, I ripped off the packaging and sprayed on my wrist. Immediately Im hit with a delightful almost burnt sugar. This smell envelopes me and Im mesmerized. I can't stop smelling me wrist. Its addictive. It softens into an incredibly comforting vanilla that I just adore. Its an understatement to say I'm a fan.", "8": "2014 was the year I was depressed the most. I encountered a lot of challenges in both professional and personal aspects of my life. When I started to become interested with perfumes, it lessened my anxiety and depression. Believe me, I was a bit mental. Manic-depression hit me and my friends and family were very worried about me. I even considered shutting all the people around me. But perfumes helped me overcome that grim, devastating, and tormenting chapter in my life. \n\nWhile my collection was growing, I still could not find the scent that could totally eradicate the remaining sadness in me. I tried happy fragrances like Lancome's La Vie Est Belle, Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle, and other fragrances with delighful nuances. However, they could not really move me.\n\nBut when I got a set of vintage secondhand miniature bottles of Dior perfumes, I was captivated by Hypnotic Poison. I overlooked this fragrance before because many Youtube reviewers mentioned that it is mostly a caramel-based fragrance, and I did not want to replace Mugler Angel as my caramel masterpiece. At first, I found the bottle really beautiful. The combination of black and red really gets my attention. And the vintage formulation (even though I only got a 5ml miniature) is phenomenal. The fluid was even really sticky; thus, signifying pure concentration of ingredients. Yes, there is indeed the play-doh vibe to it; but, hey! Who didn't like play-doh when they were young? I own two 3.4-ounce bottles, and I loved it!\n\nIt is quite ironic how a dark and sensual fragrance helped me shift my emotions back to reality. When I initially smelt it, it brought me back to my childhood when I only had to play around the garden with my brother and sister and our only problem was escaping my grandmother from sleeping in the afternoon (my grandparents were of Spanish descent; so we had this \"siesta\" period in the afternoon that we had to sleep; otherwise, our grandmother would hit us with a wooden bamboo stick). It brought me back to the times when I was the happiest. Its sweetness also paints a big smile on my face due to the fact that I have a sweet tooth so as my grandparents (may they rest in peace).\n\nThis fragrance is my favorite. I would love to have a vintage bottle of this; but, it is really hard to find here in the Philippines. I tried bidding on Ebay but they do not ship to my country and I am afraid that it could be fake. If I could get the vintage bottle of this, I would be the happiest!\n\nDior Hypnotic Poison saved me.", "9": "I douse myself in Hypnotic Poison and I am veiled to seduce Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, rule Egypt, conquer empires, bring men to their knees, make them my slaves and then devour them whole.\n\nI won this as a prize in July 2012.  \nA prize indeed.\n\nIt would be my signature along with Dior Addict if both weren't so all encompassing, each too intoxicating, overwhelming and seductive for daily wear.", "10": "Mmmmm.....I'm in love!\n\nI've gone in a fortnight (after 25 years of snobbish floral/chypre only-perfumistery) from HATING vanilla to absolutely adoring it in two sweet fragrances  - Dior Addict (warm, spicy, vanilla/tonka/white floral MAGIC) and Hypnotic Poison - vanilla with a nutty, sandalwood, rosewood, caraway and plum dry down.\n\nThere is NOTHING else like this beauty out there. The delicious sweetness is everything the LVEB, Angel and Flowerbomb-ers out there  wish they could be. \n\nNot cloying, not sugary, I don't get the coconut (thank God)... just sexy, warm, nutty, vanillic deliciousness!

A lady wore it regularly when she picked her son up from my school. It was unlike anything else I had ever smelled. I could smell the points where she had manouvered through the school pick-up crowd and I always followed her scent trail as clear as if it was a string. When I came back in contact with it by chance about 15 years later, I was kind of disappointed with the performance. It was somewhat of a skin scent and not long-lasting on my skin or fabric, however, due to nostalgia and the sheer beauty of it, I still treasured my bottle. \n\nFast forward to present day, I bought another bottle and the performance and sillage have significantly improved. I'm not sure if it's my nose but the sillage stronger and it's much more long-lasting albeit not the powerhouse it once was. It still falls flat in warm weather but when it's cool, it is just magnificent.\n\nThe name 'Hypnotic' is very apt because there is a note or accord in here that draws you in. There is a play-doh vibe in the beginning but once that dissipates a little, HP is a coconut, almond, vanilla dream. For me, it's the ultimate sweater weather scent and I just can't get enough of it even after all of these years. It truly is true love.", "13": "Caution it is hot!\n\nIf this perfume was available from the beginning of time I would imagine it being the signature scent of Delilah, Salome, Cleopatra and Mata Hari.

On my skin- licorice- almond- and rich vanilla and woods .  The jasmine is very light & the fruit almost non-existent.  I was gifted by my daughter a lovely gift set which I coated myself with in all seasons and very much to liberally.  I used it up all too fast and indiscreetly.\n  But now my nose has changed ...I do not like to assault others with my scent or excessive silage. I still adore this scent but only in very cold weather and only a very small bit . Just enough that one must lean in close and sniff deeply to appreciate.\n  But today I must tell on myself..I am home alone and it is very cold and snowy out.

I had noticed it was a popular perfume but never really went to try it for some reason. I'm so glad I finally did! \n\nIt is VERY long lasting. I picked up the tester and sprayed it on my wrist a month ago and I accidentally got it on my winter coat. It lasted on my coat for about 3 or so weeks. I kept thinking about it since then so I finally purchased a 30ml bottle for myself for Christmas. :) \n\nI see some people saying they have a problem with lasting power and sillage.. however on my skin, this fragrance stays on for HOURS and its projection is quite powerful. Because of this, I wouldn't dare to try more than 2 or 3 sprays, depending on your skin chemistry. I've applied two and it's almost nauseating even though it's a beautiful smell haha.  Usually with perfumes, they don't stay on my skin or become more of a skin scent (Tom ford's Velvet Orchid :(...) so i'm happy i've across this! \n\nWhen I opened it and gave it a spray, my partner said the first thing he could smell was licorice and really reminded him of the Christmas season which was warming to hear. Some other people have mentioned that they could smell play-doh. I can definitely smell that when I first applied it but went away within some minutes. Almond, jasmine and coconut was the first things that stood out to me. Now after some hours, to me it's more of a nice musky, sandalwood, vanilla scent. \n\nI don't think i'd be daring enough to try this in warmer months due to how heavy this perfume is. Or if I did, I probably would only use it at night.\n\nI can see why people adore this fragrance but I can also see why some people dislike this. For me, this is now amongst my favourite fragrances!

Of which I'm one, obviously. Here's what you're missing.\n\nThe original HP has topnotes that are darker, more nutty, and more lusciously-toxic (it does smell almost metallic). The loamy and now-removed oakmoss makes the vanilla heart just a touch dryer, smokier, and less cloying than the current. And what many people don't realise is that as you move your nose closer to the skin, the aromatic sambac jasmine and glorious sandalwood takes over, singing softly under the vanilla-musk.\n\nThe new version is still good but it's simpler, sweeter, and the top and base notes have been watered down. It's still got \"plenty of heart\"  and I do use it occasionally when I crave that bitter-sweet metallic almond tang, but I've stuffed all my precious backup bottles of the original juice into the darkest recesses of my cabinet, for carefully-rationed doses the rest of my life.", "19": "It's debatable that Hypnotic Poison my favourite Poison flanker; in the right mood. Hypnotic Poison covers a feeling that Tendre, Pure, Midnight, Girl or Original can not. \n\nThis is deeply sensual and almost erotic.

I can't speak too authoritatively on the 90s, but I am aware that gourmands were not *quite* the parfum du jour that they are today. They were more up and coming, to my knowledge. \n\nHowever, it's entirely confusing in regards to whether or not this is even a gourmand. The general consensus seems to be that it is, but I'm not so sure. Annick Mernado has an uncanny ability to create tasty scents and beautiful vanillas, \u00e0 la Body Kouros, but this particular scent alludes to something else. Something distinctly inedible. Like the name suggests, it is poisonous. Can a true Poison ever be a gourmand? \n\nThis is what you would smell in Amortenia would smell like (obscure references? hell nah, I read Harry Potter) to someone when face to face with a succubus.

We assume it\u2019s the perfume that is different, not us. While anything that\u2019s been on the market this long is indeed bound to have been reformulated multiple times, HP is one case where the integrity of the fragrance has been maintained, and there\u2019s no good reason to waste your money or time seeking out the vintage. It\u2019s exactly the same, I swear on a stack of bibles! \n\nAfter not smelling it for a while  what actually surprised me about Hypnotic Poison was how old fashioned it smells \ud83d\ude40 I didn\u2019t say \u201cbad,\u201d don\u2019t come for me!

Spraying it last night and inevitably thinking of the times in my life when I wore it most often, it finally occurred to me that the time period when something like this (or Angel for that matter) smelled so fashionable, current, and en vogue was a very, very long time ago. I went to sleep with a nostalgic little pang of longing in my heart for that long gone era.", "23": "Christmas day I was lucky enough to receive this as a gift, the 150ml EDT edition. Happily unwrapped,chuffed to finally have it in my hands after waiting at least 4yrs for it. It is expensive, then again it is Dior. \n\nWell.worth.the.wait!. It is as it states in the perfume name, hypnotic. Sweet but not sickly sweet in a way, I.e: Britney Spears Fantasy and Aqualina Pink Sugar, are. It's a strong projection of sweet creamy vanilla with notes of almond and a musky woody base. The woody base gives this scent some grounding. I do detect a very slight hint of smokiness. It does as the day goes on, become more linear, after about 10-12hrs+. This has got sex appeal, depth and substance. It has a grown up energy with a vampish edge to it. It's vampish, deep, rich, strong yet warm, cosy and comforting. I've been thinking of something I could compare it to, yet I can't think of anything I've smelled, owned or tried before. Couldn't ever now imagine it not being in my collection, now I have it. When best to wear it?.... I don't follow rules, I wear what I want when I want. I do however see how many a one agree it is best, due to its richness, in autumn and winter. It isn't for everyone, but I wouldn't say it's a polarising scent like Thierry Mugler's Angel.", "24": "This will always be one of my favorite perfumes. It\u2019s a fragrance I grew up with as it was my mother\u2019s signature scent. I remember sneaking into her bedroom for whiffs from this beautiful bottle. I used to think the bottle was so mysterious and exotic looking and I would fantasize about a genie living inside. I pretty much live for powdery scents and orientals, this is definitely an inherited trait from my mother. What can I really say? I think this perfume is perfect. It\u2019s sweet yet spicy and the almond note I pick up on reminds me of Italian love knot and Pignoli cookies.", "25": "What is even left to say about this masterpiece. I mean honestly. The pinnacle of the gourmand family. Rich, chewy vanilla, smooooth coconut, creamy sandalwood, bitter almond. To die. It's so deep and rich, yet somehow is so far away from saccharine. It's definitely strong, but has such amazing integrity that the scent never distorts, no matter the distance you're smelling it from. Quality quality quality. Two people have told me this smells like chocolate cake, and I can actually pick that up too, though it's not coming from any cacao or cake notes. So I don't know where it's coming from tbh, but I don't care. Sexy, smoldering, warm, elegant, all of it. This is a grown woman's gourmand and an absolute classic. \n\nPerformance is incredible. Longevity = 10 hours on me, projection = moderate to strong. LOOOVE :)", "26": "How can I explain my attachment to this perfume without telling the story of how I discovered it? About 6 years ago my husband had bought me Poison Girl as a birthday present. I was in my mid-twenties, I had a blooming interest in perfumes and I had specifically asked for the Girl version because I liked how sweet and vibrant it was. Upon wearing it on my skin I realized that, while I still liked it a lot, it was too cloying at times and too bubbly for my personality. I wanted that, but more mature... I had no idea it existed.\n\nA few years later I was on a business trip, it was mid December in Germany so that city centers all had their Christmas fairs up. One evening my colleagues and I went shopping, we perused the stores, drank some mulled wine outside, admired all the Christmas decorations. It was cold, I was far away from home, holiday spirit was in the air, you expected it to start snowing any minute. We entered a perfume shop and I started spraying based on bottle design, first on cards then on my skin. And then I saw it, sitting to next to my regular Poison Girl. I did not think, I put it directly on my skin, there was little place available by now and it went partially on my thick winter coat, just on my pulse point.\n\nOh wow, what an explosion... bitter almond and vanilla, yes. But also grandma's best dessert, made after the oldest family recipe that has been passed down for generations. The sensation of finally being indoors after a freezing walk outside, the soft touch of a delicate satin scarf, the promise of home. Hygge in a bottle. A woman that is both strong and feminine, assertive and soft, attractive and smart as hell. I could feel it on my coat the next day at work and I fell in love. I think this will be the defining scent of my 30s.", "27": "This is a much more complicated scent that some of the reviews suggest.  I definitely am getting tuberose and jasmine along with the foody vanilla, almond and coconut which takes this so far from a simple gourmand.  I have the EDT and ONE spray has enveloped me in sweetness for hours but not childish sweetness, lovely sweet flowers.  I know I'll get hell but it sort of reminds me of Madonna's first scent.  That one, too, is heady, sweet white flowers.  I just do not get root beer at all.  This is cozy, sexy and perfect for winter.", "28": "This is probably my favorite scent of all time. Just completely intoxicating in my opinion. I love a gourmand scent and this is just the top tier of all gourmands. I may be dramatic, but really this is just a masterpiece. Constantly getting compliments, asked what I'm wearing. I smell like a cozy, warm, vanilla dream. I definitely get the almond and sandalwood coming through. Very long lasting, can smell myself through the whole day. Timeless. Also my husband is obsessed when I wear this.", "29": "This is a yummy root beer float with the most delicious sweet vanilla ice cream. I think a lot of designer houses would have tried to \"balance\" this by adding some fruity notes in here, but I'm so glad Dior didn't- I love the overload of creamy, sweet vanilla goodness. It's EDT concentration but performance is really good, more like an EDP (and yes, I have the current, 2019 formulation). \n\nThis is a classic for a reason!", "30": "This is such a lovely vanilla coconut, I love it to bits and need to buy another bottle as my current one has only a few drops left. To finish a bottle and want more is has to be good. So warm and comforting, it\u2019s one of the only reason I wear fragrance, not to please anyone but myself.", "31": "Root beer float!\n\nI was in a Sephora one day and tried this on a paper strip out of curiosity (full disclosure: the bottle and concept lured me). Wow! This stuff smells great! Yes...a root beer float. That describes it as well as anything else. It's yummy. \n\nAfter another couple of visits and re-tests on paper strips I wondered - how would this smell ON ME? \n\nWell... it still smells great! Just like some sweet, delicious gourmet food. And there's the problem. Do I want to smell myself smelling like a sweet gourmet food? Or a root beer float? You would think this is a non-issue, but it is as it influences my self-image. Bad ass or teddy bear? (I am a big, tall guy.)  \n\nI wear A-Men Pure Malt, which is very foody/boozy just fine. But somehow that's different.   \n\nI'll have to ponder this one. I've been looking or a vanilla scent, but as things stand it's probably Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, not this. But my opinion could change!\n\nAnd this stuff smells great! I need to get another sample for my wife... (Update: I did, and she agrees: root beer float. But she's not a fan.)", "32": "Hypnotic poison is a soft, languid dance of Vanilla and spices. It starts off with a bitter almond bite, that might put some people off, but if you stick around, the almond fades and the perfume melds into your skin. Hypnotic poison will seduce you, and convince you to spend the night. And when you wake, it is still there...soft, sweet and warm..on your skin, in your hair, and on your pillow case.\n\nIt reminds me of the holidays, and invokes the song \"Baby it's cold Outside\"", "33": "Rich, thick, creamy, almond vanilla, the fragrance that hooked me into perfume.  About five years ago, I sprayed Hypnotic Poison on my arm and continued with my shopping. While trying to concentrate on which shoes would be most comfortable for hiking, something so incredibly beautiful kept wafting up, capturing my attention until I could think of nothing else.  OMG!  What was this fragrance that was literally taking my will to think of anything else away.  I bought a large bottle.\n\nBack then, not knowing how to keep fragrances, I sprayed the entire contents into a gorgeous crystal flacon because I didn\u2019t like the rubbery looking red bottle with the black cap.  I then displayed it in a sunny window where it showed off the bottle to perfection...not good.  Unfortunately, the fragrance turned bad in a short amount of time and I had to throw it out, lesson learned.\n\nA friend commented on my second bottle and how lovely it was so I gave it to her with full intentions of buying another one.  Well, by the time I got around to buying it again, I was excited to find that it came in a gorgeous red glass bottle with a purple lid.  Beautiful!  But then, oh noooo!  It didn\u2019t smell the same.  After settling down from the shock, I found that I still loved the fragrance and still find it to be better than any other almond vanilla I\u2019ve smelled.  So I will continue to wear and enjoy it.\n\nCoconut, allspice, flowers, and woods are perfectly blended into almond and vanilla creating something so marvelous that even after all this time and through a few mishaps and/or lessons learned, I still wonder at its beauty.  Because of its strong, sweet, richness, I think it\u2019d be more suitable for cooler weather.", "34": "I am so happy I bought this!  This perfume is so delicious!  The vanilla and almond really are prominent as people say, and these two notes I absolutely adore.  It does have quite a powdery scent to it, which smells very mature and captivating.  This is definitely in my top 5 fragrances.  I love it and want to wear it all the time.  It is not a smell that I can ever forget, and it is very easy to become addicted to it.", "35": "Hypnotic Poison is a true Dior masterpiece. From the first moment I tested Hypnotic Poison on my wrist during its Macy's launch, I was completely spellbound by the potion's intoxicating aroma of creamy almond and rich exotic woods. It was love at first sniff. I took a bottle home with me on the spot. After all these year's of adding beautiful lux perfumes to my collection, the seductive scent of Hypnotic Poison still leaves me breathless. I adore it. It's on my holy grail perfume list and I will never be without a bottle in my collection.", "36": "Hypnotic Poison is the fragrance that will transform you into a dangerous and enchanting seductress, like a witch whose powers are untouchable and  whose beauty is absolutely immeasurable. Her beauty is so deep and powerful that it enraptures men and puts them under her spell, without her even having to perform an incantation. She drives men wild with her air of mystery and sensuality.  The men who fall victim to her charms know she is more powerful than they and thus have no desire to dominate her, but only to be in her magical presence.  Her scent is part of her tempting and sexual air that reaches out to all men she passes and drags them into her like wild sickly vines.  Those who have been lucky enough to be seduced by her will crave for another taste of her the rest of their lives; her image and essence will never unwrap their grasp from her lover's minds. \n\nSorceresses like Mary Sibley from Salem would undoubtedly use Hypnotic Poison to devise their seductive presence that the men around them cannot break their gaze from. Its sensual powers can go from being enchanting to manipulative if not taken positive control of, so be very careful. Because this fragrance is so dark, tempting, mysterious, and elegant, it's the epitome of brunette beauty.  Of course any woman can don this lovely perfume, but its scent is evocative of the hypnotic sexual powers that brunettes characteristically possess.", "37": "Hypnotic Poison is heavenly... not an easy one to pull off for sure, but once it's in harmony with your chemistry it's really like no other.\n\nTo my nose it's not foody at all, it has way too much depth to smell foody. Rather, it's warm, soothing, comforting and enveloping in a unique way.", "38": "I\u2019m  extremely late to the party on hypnotic poison. For some reason I had always tested it in stores throughout the years but I didn\u2019t seem to click with it. Maybe I would test it in the summer and didn\u2019t appreciate its beauty then,but now in the cool and crispness of autumn,I\u2019m completely in love with this gorgeous aroma of bitter almond and vanilla. Masterpiece", "39": "What I can imagine Lucrezia Borgia would wear had she lived in this century. \nA venetian red Valentino dress, a kitten smile, an intrigue filled with cyanide and smolder and Hypnotic Poison inside her ring. \n\nThe smell of vanilla laced bitter almonds that lingers on the air after cyanide has reaped its toll at a crime scene plays a trick on the mind that turns all sorts of harmless, digestible things like coconut, vanilla, almonds and licorice smell mouth-watering yet inedible.

Dior, what the hell...?", "40": "To be honest what made me test Hypnotique Poison was Monica Bellucci.\nI heard that she wears it besides being the face of it and I wanted to know what was the deal with it.\nAt first it opens with a harsh almost artificial smell that lasts only some seconds.\nLater on it gets better and better. It's impossible take your nose from it.\nOn my skin it smells like this:\nA rootber float with the most exclusive vanilla ice cream next to a freshly baked almond cookies served on a fancy table with a jar full of freshly cut jazmine bouquet.\nIt's a killing sensation.\nDo I find it sexy? No, I find it perfectly comforting, like a warm hug that makes me want to cuddle with a great book. \nIntoxicating? Yes and addictive.\nI don't know the previous version, but this one is perfect.\nLongevity and sillage are not overwelming if propperly applied.\nA must for those who enjoy warm and spicy vanilla perfumes.\nA real new classic that must stay forever.", "41": "I now own a bottle from 2002 when it said \"Christian Dior\" instead of just \"Dior\" and a bottle from 2006 when it had already been changed to \"Dior\" but still had the red ring and black cap. If you can find an authentic vintage bottle, buy it! It's so much more beautiful than the current reformulation that seems like a very poor copy of the original. There is a beautiful depth and richness to the original that is completely lacking in the current reformulation. I find the 2002 version to be stronger and a touch more medicinal in the top notes than the 2006. It's a shame what they have done to this once intoxicating and unique fragrances. It seems like Dior has recently ruined so many of their once exquisite fragrances.", "42": "I cannot believe the QUALITY of an EDT made in the 90's versus the EDT made after the millennium.

The best way I have described it to friends is: imagine a patisserie had sex with a candy shop...while voyeuristic gummy bears watched...as they ate caramel-coated marshmallows. Then, put that whole scenario into a bottle and ta-da...you've got Hypnotic Poison. I love, love, love this. It is a must-have for anyone who is as gourmand-obsessed as I am.", "46": "Okay, so I'm definitely one of those people who gets Play Doh with this, big time. I've tried it a few times over the winter and each time come to the conclusion that we sadly don't match.\n\nHere in the UK it is now nearly summer, temperatures are starting to rise and suddenly, out of nowhere, I get this sudden compulsion to spray HP. So, after my shower this evening I take a deep breath and apply ..... what was I thinking? My reward was the most delightful, dreamy soft and slightly powdery vanilla I have ever experienced. Yes, the Play Doh vibe was still noticeable, only lighter and much less dominant than before ... and I have struggled to move my nose from my wrist since then! So, for me at least, I think slightly warmer weather is better for this little gem.\n\nWait, what was that strange noise? Ah ... that, my friends, was the sound of my wallet running for cover beneath the sofa!", "47": "I love this on my lady. I use to prefer Prada Candy on her as a go to fragrance. But now when she puts on this \"Poison\", I can't control myself. I wish I could live on her neck.", "48": "Recently a lady at work wore Hypnotic Poison and wow, I still love it. I purchased it a year ago as I love long - lasting and deep scents, so HP was on my to buy list. When I wore it, I noticed there was, unfortunately, no longevity on me. Fifteen minutes after spraying, the scent was gone. Besides this though, what a heavenly scent that is - so recognizable. It is a rich and sweet scent, that is almost like a fizzy vanilla smell. Very unique and addictive. Will have to give this one another go soon as it is a divine fragrance.", "49": "My most recent accusation. I was always afraid of this scent, always thought it would be too powerful and bitter and i never tried this scent for what i had in my mind but recently i tested it after reading some good reviews and OH MY GOD!!

I was ok blind-buying something like Montblanc Explorer because I was told it smells like Aventus, a fragrance I know I like. Surprise, it smelled like Aventus, and I liked it. Similarly, I recently ordered Zino because I was told it's essentially a far cheaper Beau de Jour, and I'm hoping that recommendation proves true as well when it arrives. This is to say I had no earthly clue what I was getting into ordering Encre Noire. I'd never tried any of the scents people compared it to, all I knew was that it was simple and smelled expensive despite being truly dirt cheap. So, one cold and rainy winter day, I wore it, just to see what would happen. I mean, what could possibly happen, right?  \nMy dear readers, after a day with this scent, I am left awestruck, dumbfounded, and with the sudden uncontrollable urge to go build a deck. And I live in an apartment. \nLet's get one thing clear, this is not your average juice from off the shelf at Dillard's. This is for real-deal fragrance heads, and if that doesn't describe you, my best advice is to turn back now because I can almost guarantee you will not like it. That having been said, I love this fragrance. It does one thing and one thing only, and that is smoky vetiver. You may as well just stick blades of vetiver grass up your own nose, it would have a similar effect. It is powerful and not to be denied. It's almost as if someone cranked an aftershave up to 11 and bottled it as a traditional fragrance. The fact that there's an Intense version of this scent is terrifying. However, being a powerful fragrance isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sure, there's stuff like 1 Million and Dylan Blue out there that can smoke out a room in under a minute, but there's also the kind of powerful that comes from the Toy Boys and Encre Noires of the world: a rich, enveloping blanket of fragrance that lets people know you're there, but doesn't reach out and slap them in the nose with it. The fact that I'm a big fan of vetiver to begin with only helps its case. It may be a humble and unassuming herbal note, but it lends a lovely fresh smokiness to whatever it's put in, like a bonfire in a pine forest with a dash of fresh mint thrown in. It's just so classy and irresistable. That's what this scent smells like for me: a forest. A big, gorgeous coniferous forest somewhere in the PNW or even northern Michigan or Maine. It's rugged, but not dirty. Smoky, but not acrid. Simply put, it's fantastic. \nSadly, the only issue with this fragrance is its longevity, which HA HA FOOLED YA IT LASTS FOR YONKS. This scent is no wilting flower, no sir. 8+ hours in and you'll still be catching whiffs of it as the woodiness deepens and darkens into being something almost otherworldly. As mentioned above, projection is also fantastic. This is a scent you can overspray, however, and it doesn't take much to get there. Best to spritz yourself conservatively, wait a few minutes, and judge if you need more. Maybe get a second opinion while you're at it. Best of all, though, is the incredible value of this scent. I got 30ml for around 20 bucks and I still think I might have gotten ripped off because I've seen over 100ml of the stuff going for under 40. That almost sounds too good to be true, but it's all real. I've eaten sandwiches more expensive than this bottle. Unquestionably the best value in my entire collection. \nEncre Noire is wild, crazy, and amazing. Regardless of how you feel about vetiver or woody fragrances in general, you have to give this one at least a passing sniff just for the spectacle of it all. Not to mention the fact that it's a perfect buy right now with the coldest months of the year coming up in America. Grab your warmest socks and your favorite brand of spiced cider and let the cozy vibes take over with a spritz of this dark, smoky goodness.", "2": "One word for this fragrance: sharp. Sharp like a piece of deep gray metal cut with machine precision into a right angle.  \nThis fragrance does not need approval nor does it seek permission. It is quite clear in its intentions and is not interested in what you are selling. It would very much prefer to be alone.  \nIf Marcus Aurelius wore fragrance, it would be this one.  \nBest for:  \n1. Confidently walking at night in a cold city. \n2. Plotting someone's demise. \n3. Reading the ancient stoics.", "3": "Holy mother Mary. Dear Lord upon high, praise the saints.  \nThis is the ultimate holy grail of fragrance for me. \nMy favorite note of all time is cypress, but I've never been able to find a wonderful, dark, lush cypress note that lasts and isn't paired with vile citruses... \nI'd always seen this being reviewed on here, but I never decided to give it a chance...but after getting my last paycheck, I couldn't say no to a 3.4oz bottle for $30 on ebay.  \nFirst impressions: The bottle is gorgeous. Statuesque. Minimalist. Dark. Geometric...and altogether aesthetically pleasing. It reminds me of luxurious dark-stained wood and obsidian stones.  \nThen I sprayed it on...the sprayer is WONDROUS, because it gives a full, round, cloud of fragrance that goes onto the skin so well.  \nThis is everything I've been looking for, fragrance-wise. It's sharp, pungent, shadowy, dark, voluptuous, and altogether smoky and seductive. \nMy skin brings out the astringent quality of cypress that I adore so much, but the smoky vetiver radiates quite well as well, and it even has a nice edge that reminds me of orange peels.  \nTo me, this is very reminiscent of a wooded forest at dawn, in mid-Autumn. Wet, herbal, and incredibly woodsy. Wet orange leaves peppering the forest floor, that is covered with moss and mushrooms. There's even an accord that reminds me of the rising fog at dawn. \nThis is a gorgeous fragrance, and I do believe this has got to be one of my most favorite fragrances of all time. You CANNOT go wrong with this. For the price, the longevity, the power, and the design, there is nothing to lose because this is one of the few PERFECT FRAGRANCES in this world.", "4": "People keep touting this fragrance as a sad, uninviting one, but I don't find it as that at ALL. You could definitely call it melancholy but even then I see it as just a very, very peaceful fragrance. It smells just like being at peace, whether you're sad or happy. \nWhen I smell it, it reminds me of my time in Hawaii. Not of the commercial, Honolulu beach, drinking from a coconut Hawaii, but rather the nature aspects and the calm, untouched wet forest areas. It really smells so natural and beautiful, like a place untouched by humanity where only mother nature has done a thing, and you're here to see it. \nThe few notes in this fragrance combine to form something more complex than most bottles I've ever smelled. The wood is more reminiscent of something like wet log in a forest, rather than woodchips. \nThis fragrance honestly reminds me of a lot of things, but everything I think of it is kind of \"dimly lit\" if that makes any sense, but not in a sad way. A quiet teahouse. An untouched wet forest. These are the things this fragrance makes me think of. \nAs for the people saying this fragrance is \"sad\", I really can't help but feel that you WILL find that in this fragrance if that's what you're looking for. However not everybody around you is expecting and looking for a sad fragrance. People I've shown this fragrance to have rather said it just smells peaceful, among other similar things. \nThis fragrance could cost $200. Niche quality for a crazy cheap price. It's honestly more interesting and intriguing to me than most niche fragrances too. \nIf you're testing this fragrance, give it a couple minutes, and don't press your nose to your skin. This fragrance is one where it's more appreciated as a looming background scent rather than in your face. This is how other people would be smelling it anyway, so smell it like that. \nThe presentation is wonderful. The sprayer is also one of the best I have, like Dior Sauvage you can choose just how much you spray. \nVery happy with my purchase.", "5": "The first time I tried a vetiver-heavy frag was in a parking lot outside of Ross in San Antonio on a particularly hot July afternoon. I remember how much it stood out to me at the time being the novice that I was. I had gotten used to safe, clubbing citrus and aquatic notes and I was not prepared (but very happy) to smell something more mature and timeless.\n\nSince then I have openly worn vetiver \"night\" and \"winter\" scents in the blazing heat. There is something about the immediate and almost unbearable eruption of woodiness against the backdrop of an unforgiving sun that speaks to my style. \n\nEncre Noire is the best smelling and most dynamic vetiver I have tried to date and I can safely say that I will also be wearing it while I sweat out this summer in an only slightly cooler climate. \n\nA few reviewers have described this as smelling like depression which, while I respect their opinion (it made me buy it! Thanks!!), is not a place I quite get to. To me it smells like a man who has embraced a certain sadness, but still moves forward with a sense of survival and optimism. The woods that come from the skin for 8+ hours suggest a contemplative depth. I see this as a scent (appropriately) associated with books and learning. I see a man lost in thought, walking in the woods then back to a warm den to solve a life problem with help from long-dead philosophers. This scent suggests a connection with the past that is able to live in modern times and keep up with the news. \n\nThis is dark, woody and breathtakingly beautiful. There is nothing sweet or floral about it. This is base, jaded masculinity trying to find a place in a decaying culture without wilderness.\n\n10/10", "6": "Encre Noire smells like you\u2019re 299 years old and then on your 300th birthday you dig yourself out of your grave under an ancient pine tree in a forgotten forest to disturb the living.", "7": "A great, clean vetiver with a dark twist. I find Encre Noir to have 3 quite distinct phases while keepeng the same characteristics throughout. The opening is potent, earthy, dark and a bit pungent, then it settles down to a mid phase where vetiver plays its main role with a transparent and clean intepretation. It's bold and somehow polite, clean but not affected and it still mantain the \"dark nuance\" that makes it so fascinating. In the final phase, the vetiver is enhanced in its licorice aspect and, together with musk and woody notes, give birth to a delighful drydown (assuming you don't mind a consistent dose of Iso E Super).

As the water comes cast down onto the pine and oak leaves that lay in the dirt you get Encre Noire. I have heard Snobs online say this smells like a 2x4. I want to know where the hell you get a 2x4 that smells like this, I want to build my house out of it. If this was 300$ then everyone would be calling it a masterpiece. It's 30$ and worth every dime spent. You smell like the true woods, and not a shallow imitation some replicate. You will not smell super masculine, you will not be a compliment beast, you will be refined and one with nature. Open your eyes to this, and if you don't like it then I understand. It's not scary at all, and not Gothic as some call it. I wear this around Goth Chicks all the time and I wish it were more scary, maybe then I could ask them out without being scared LMAO.

Not just any violin too, mind you, but specifically mine. After years, even decades of use, I find violins develop a unique scent of their own that is a combination of the rosin type and amount used, its wood of construction, and the natural scent of its owner.\n\nAs many have said, it's certainly a brooding, melancholic scent. Yet there's also an astringency (perhaps the cypress?) about it, evocative of a few (admittedly deserved) sharp critiques I've earned from conservatory professors in decades past. For that, this fragrance feels at once familiar and comforting, but also challenging and even a little disquieting\u2013\u2013but always beautiful.\n\nDefinitely something I would love catching a whiff of off a man.

Since then I already bought another bottle of Encre Noir and its flankers Extreme and Sport.\nEncre Noire (black paint) is a strong vetiver cocktail. It's not the traditional barbershop easy to wear vetiver. It's a dark pleasing to wear vetiver accord, result of blending a couple of high quality vetiver notes. It's extreamly classy and its wearer will surely be noticed by the people around him.\nMy attention was also captured by magnific minimalist black cubic bottle with a wooden cap. So simple and so beautiful.\nThis fragrance is signature scent material.\nAfter a couple of sprays, you notice a magnificent imposing cypress. The vetiver middle notes make themselves noticed almost immediately, embracing the cypress without choking it.\nYou get a touch of wood (cashmere) and musk with the base notes to enhance the pleasant darkness mood.\nThere is something animalic about the fragrance that catches your attention in a good way. The notes combination lead you to scent a dark aura around the created ambiance together with a gorgeous smokiness.\n\nPerformance is above average. You get bigger performance if you spray on your clothes and hair. Easily you get an eight to ten hours of longevity. Sillage is not as strong and you share you darkness within five and six feet.

By that I mean it is not expansive in its scent; it's a punctuation, narrow and succinct. It's not a bouquet, and if you sit there and huff your wrist trying to puzzle out its notes, you're missing the point. It's the most independent stink I've ever encountered. It doesn't need you. It doesn't like you. Like an ornery black cat, it will indifferently accompany you - if it doesn't immediately hate you, and make you a fool and social pariah.\n\nAnd, to me, this is a good thing.\n\nIt's a good thing because, if you are in a mood to be taken with gravitas, noticed and inexplicably respected without saying a word, Encre Noir is a olfactory hitman in a black suit and dark glasses standing off to your side. Its design as a Full Stop is surrounding you with an inky, smokey force field that's strong enough to stop opinions. And maybe bullets. This stuff ain't kidding.\n\nAs long as it tolerates you.\n\nAnd it will tolerate you only as long as you play by its rules. No monkeyshines. This is not a pic-a-nic party scent; goofy grins are incompatible, no loud Hawaiian shirts, or tee shirts with screen printed fol-der-rol. Try any nonsense, and this scent will turn on you in a heartbeat and make you smell like you rolled in cat poop. Attitude, and attitude alone controls Encre Noir.\n\nLet me tell you a story. I work in one of the garden spots of deepest Joisey: Trenton. There have been 34 murders this year within a 2 block radius of my workplace. They play this game here - You walk in one direction, the toughs are coming from the other direction. They move into your lane; you're now playing chicken.\n\nI am 51, I am wearing a black safari fedora and armed with Encre Noir. They move. Every time. \n\nI'm not saying it's the frag that moves them; I am saying that attitude is everything, and Encre Noir is the liquid embodiment of that kind of attitude. Some frags are for play, some play to win; this one doesn't play, period.", "24": "Ah, Fragrantica! Will you ever lead me astray???\n\nI finally walked into Douglas and 'demanded' that they let me try EN, judging from the looks on the faces of the assistants, I could easily tell that doesn't happen very often. But I digress.\n\nI grew up in Northern Nigeria, my childhood memories are of course varied but a smell that lingers in my memory is that of ''wet earth'' when the rainy season comes by to water the parched land, another is ''burning wood''  which was common for heating and cooking, and the third is the homemade Ink my Quranic school teacher used to make for his Arabic calligraphy. EN is not quite any of these, but it is reminiscent of all.\n\nI could do the breakdown of notes, but many others have reviews better than I could ever make, so Instead I will describe the feeling I had after applying a  spritz to the wrist.\n\n0-5 Minutes: Hey, whats that smell. Why do people say all those things? Am I anosmic to the notes?\n\n5-10 Minutes: Wait, this is interesting, is that wet earth, and 'ink'?\n\n10-30 Minutes: I feel like I'm in a cloud of wet earth, burnt wood and ink  - projection slightly more than elbow length. It could have been just me but I'm certain everyone I passed felt the cloud as well.\n\n1hr later, it settles to a light, extremely pleasant, and strangely ''fresh'' scent. At this point I can not stop sniffing my wrist. And though I can't explain it I swear I get lemons! No lie!\n\nAnyway, this is a complex and uncommon scent; something unlike anything I have ever encountered, and along with Aventus, it is exactly how I think a man should smell. The irony here being that I am a lover of Orientals.\n\nI will surely order a bottle and get back to this review. For those who haven't tried it yet - don't be put off by negative reviews or the mixed feelings this gets - try it for yourself.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the bottle is absolutely lovely?!", "25": "What else can be said about this fragrance that hasn't been said? I very much agree with how another commenter described Encre Noir. This smells like depression. A very lonely, solitary scent. However, please don't be put off by that description. It doesn't mean it smells bad. This is the most beautiful, artistic, mysteriously dark and lonely rendition of the word I've experienced in a perfume. Where other perfumes are fragrances, this is art. It paints such a beautiful picture, in its own black ink. This can be worn in any season in my opinion, however it becomes otherworldly and transportive in winter and especially on cold, rainy days.\n\nThis fragrance is a journey through a dank, dark cypress forest on a rainy winters day. Wearing your winter coat, you walk around the dark forest bed, your hot breath creating smokey precipitation around you. The damp smell of rotten logs from ancient trees long fell nips at your nostrils, but you find it pleasant. Moss and fern permeates the the thick, damp air. It's cold, but you feel at peace. The forest is very silent, very old, very primal. You feel you've connected with it, and are just beginning to understand it. \n\nI'm not skilled enough to really explain what a masterpiece this is. Not everyone will enjoy this fragrance, and it seems most women aren't too fond of it, but those I've talked to do not dislike it either, they're just not crazy about it. Men on the otherhand absolutely go crazy for it. (The thought of women wearing this to attract a swarm of men just made me chuckle) For me, this is a fragrance I wear mostly for myself. However in winter, or perhaps a cold, rainy spring day I'd wear this outdoors. Otherwordly. Not a fragrance for anyone under 25, in my opinion, and that's cutting it pretty young. But if you look the part, you may be able to pull this off. It's very mysterious, dark, and mature. Inky and inexplicably alluring. Seductive and yet it pushes you away. A true masterpiece.\n\nI will have to say though, on my skin, quite unfortunately, the \"new\" reformulation, while still a wonderful scent, isn't nearly as beastmode as it used to be many years ago. The scent has been changed a bit, slightly diluted, and weaker, and it's not as harsh as it used to be, probably in an effort to make it more mass appealing. Some people may actually prefer it this way to the original, but the original is the real masterpiece here. I still very much love this reformulation, just not as much as I love the vintage. I'd describe performance as moderate. Longevity is just not good now. Again though, despite this shortcoming, and it is quite a shortcoming, the price and smell certainly justifies the buy.\n\nSo should you blind buy this? Depends. As you probably already know, this is a pretty polarizing fragrance, and it takes a certain mindset to really appreciate it. If you know you'll absolutely never get a sample or a chance to smell it, then yes, absolutely. It's just too affordable not to bet on the chance that you may fall in love with it. The price is almost obscene for something this special. Please do yourself a favour and purchase this before it disappears, as many fragrances do with time. It is lalique's Magnum Opus. \n\n\nScent: 10/10\nSilage: 6/10\nLongevity: 5.5/10\nPersonal Appreciation: Masterpiece/10", "26": "I finally decided to try Encre Noir and I must say I now see what all the fuss is about. It is fantastic! But it is NOTHING like I expected. I expected it to be so much more in your face masculine but it isn't at ALL. It is so pure and even ethereal...it smells peaceful and tranquil. This is a scent that could break a bad mood with one whiff. It is the fragrance equivalent of those counselors who talk people off of ledges. It just says \"everything is going to be okay\". I don't mean to sound kooky but I have been feeling really down and smelling Encre Noir is sort of getting me off my very own ledge right now. This is actually a nearly perfect fragrance and is completely unisex. Everyone should experience this so don't let any label stop you.", "27": "I've added this to my 5 favourite fragrances but I can't say this was a love at first sniff.\n Encre Noire is so different, original, elegant and high quality that I must start this review by saying this is a piece of art. I tried this on the store 5 times before purchasing since although I was always amazed by its features, doubted \"isn't this for older men?\" \"doesn't it smell a bit strange and hard to know when to use it?\" etc. But I had to have it you know... it came to my mind several times and then I went for it. I reckon this isn't a cozy scent. It is cold, high class and distant... misterious and dark. It doesn't invite you to hug the person wearing it... neither recalls a former romance... but it is so captivating that it succeeds in creating a charming atmosphere. I've used it only for nights out and some hot afternoons (the lemony end is soooo refreshing!!!)and I always come back home saying: Why does this perfume create such a craze? women can't stop mentioning its charm, men can't keep their distance and beg me to give away the secret... but only you fragrantic chums and I know what this is... Black Ink and its spell.", "28": "This fragrance is insane, for anyone worried about \"reformulation\" and it being weak.. Well, I dread to think what the original was like. I bought a new bottle today and one spray is enough to fill a room easily.\n\nAs for the fragrance, it's absolute class. I get the feeling of the earthiness from Terre d'Hermes without any of the brighter edges. This smells like the frag dug down into TdH, ripped out its heart and carried it back off to the forest in a dirty rag. I get a touch of spice which I'm guessing is the Cashmir, other than that, it's all earthy, woods and vetiver. Completely unapologetic in its raw-ness. I think for that you'll either love it or hate it. As a fan of vetiver, I'm firmly in the love crowd. It's deep, rich and well-rounded. Absolutely masculine, but it does have a softness to it, there are no hard edges in sight. If you think you might like the smell of a forest fire, you'll love it. It won't be for everyone, but it's unique and a deep, interesting, enrapturing frag. For the price you can grab this at online, it would be rude to not own this imo.", "29": "There seems to be a general consensus that Encre Noire and Chanel's Sycomore have extremely much in common. I totally agree, but they are also very different. As diorshowman has pointed out earlier, their relationship can be compared to Cool Water vs. Green Irish Tweed. Most people will easily recognize the latter as the most exclusive \u2013 and certainly the most expensive. But it is still very much up to your own personal taste which one you actually prefer.\n\nAfter having enjoyed EN during almost two years I finally got the chance to sample the hard-to-get Sycomore in Chanel\u2019s famous Paris shop in 31 Rue Cambon. First impression was \u201dThis is just Encre Noire \u2013 what\u2019s the point?\u201d. But after an hour I realized that the feeling was very different in spite of the similar basic idea. \n\nEncre Noire is dark, dry, brooding, earthy, masculine, and very linear. Sycomore is warmer, sweeter, friendlier, more anisic, unisex, shimmering, and feels more complex, unquestionably due to more exclusive ingredients.\n\nI decided to buy Sycomore in spite of the rather hefty price tag, and the two scents will now be my trustful companions for years to come. EN will remain one of my winter favorites, when I want to make the best of gloom and snow. Sycomore will be for whenever I want that little extra treat for myself (and my wife can use it too).\n\nIf you want to enjoy a very clean, dark and modern vetiver \u2013 and still at a modest price \u2013 Encre Noire is a safe buy. And by the way: The bottle is a work of art. Worth half the price in itself.", "30": "I was extremely excited for this bottle when it came in the mail today, and wasted no time opening the box. First let me note that the bottle design is a beautiful work of minimalist art, and a fantastic postmodern allegory to the ink bottle. \n\nThis EDT is gorgeous and understated, the kind of scent that defines its own genre of dark and sensuous aromatics. I have always loved clean cypress as a top note, but since the discontinuation of the Acqua di Parma's Cipresso di Toscana I have struggled to find any fragrance that uses it tactfully.\n\nThe opening is like a three-note chord from a piano: fresh vetiver and cypress oil mingling with bittersweet musk. The musk dissipates more in the dry down some time later, leaving the nectar of cashmere wood glistening with the warm cypress and grassy vetiver. It's so comfortable and distinguished, I cannot for the life of me stop sniffing my arm. \n\nEncre Noir truly is \"black ink\" in the tradition of ink making, when very fine black was once derived from carbon and tree resins. Ink today smells little like this. I even sniffed my bottle of Noodlers just to be sure!\n\nI bought the whole bottle worried it might be too \"burnt grass\" smelling for my taste, but I detect none of that. This is a striking cold weather masterpiece. It's a pride to own in my growing collection. \n\n9/10; a niche taste, but minimalist excellence.", "31": "One of my top ten scents.\n\nThis scent has led me on a quest to find the perfect vetiver. I have tried over 15 niche quality vetivers, with Fredric Malle, Annick Goutal, and Chanel bringing the closest competition to Encre Noire. \n\nI keep turning back to Encre Noire, as it is that good.\nFYI, I have only had the 79%, so my nose might be smelling a different fragrance for those that have the 78% batch.\n\nIt starts off so loud that if sprayed more than four times, I wont smell it again until two or so hours later. It is that strong. \n\nIt is extremely dry on my skin, but the way it radiates makes it \"feel\" damp. Very hard to explain without smelling it yourself. It is also extremely dark. There is a rootyness about it that makes it smell like a forest trail.\n\nThe initial note is cold, dark green cypress, which is quickly surrounded by a dry, calm vetiver.\n The greatness of this fragrance is its sheerness.It flits in and out of your periphery, with either the cypress or the vetivers catching your attention. Once pulled in, it quickly envelops you with its shroud, only to be gone in a second or two. This goes on for hours....\n\nKeep in mind that it is constantly projecting, loudly. It just creates a feel as if where ever you happen to be smells of a old, dark forest, rather than the fact that you are wearing a colonge. Ive learned 1-2 sprays is great to keep my nose unused to the scent, so that I can smell it every hour of its beauty. \n\nThis scent lasts for a solid eight hours on my very dry skin. The quality cannot be denied, as it surpasses most high end fragrances Ive had whose price was triple or quadruple Encre Noires price ($28 bucks lol)\n\nThis is a scent most suited for very formal occasions, such as weddings, galas, society gatherings etc.\n\n But it is also a great everyday scent for guys who love the outdoors. Hikers, hunters, and do it themselves -ers  could all be better off wearing something like this, as it is so confident and assuring. IMO, I could never see a woman pulling this off, and this is coming from someone that prefers Opium and Narsisco on his woman\n\nGreat Job Lalique, for a modern day classic", "32": "I made Encre Noir a blind purchase solely because of 28Cozy28's Severus Snape reference, no joke. I love to fantasize about what perfumes my favorite characters would wear (Dana Scully wears Samsara, FYI), and if this one should fit \"The Man In My Life\", then I just HAD to try it. \n\nHow fitting that both the box and bottle is very black and very stiff. \n\nFirst sniff was a bit difficult, not unconditional love at first sight to be honest. First thoughts that flew through my mind was actually a sliiightly disappointed \"oh, well, another vetiver scent\" and Terre d'Herm\u00e9s and Cuir Vetiver was my first comparisons. But then 2 sniffs later, \"oh wait, this is more like L'Artisan Dzongkha\" - it has that vegetable green note (almost pickled) lurking in the back.\n\nBut, to quote the man himself: \"If we are to truly discover the meaning of these scents, perhaps we should, for the time being, let them unfold.\"\n\n10 minutes later unfolding was done and I could not stop sniffing myself. This is perfection. This smells wet, dark, bitter, smoky and cold. A perfectly gloomy and dour fragrance in all its beauty. \n\nRain against the window in the backseat of a quiet car. \n\nAwake in the middle of the night in an empty house, the room lit by the pale moon. \n\nAll around me are familiar faces ... \u266c\n\nSeverus can know switch between this and Musc Nomade.", "33": "Encre Noire.\nDry.\nEarthy.\nSerene.\nDusty.\nSmoky.\n\nThis is a scent that would almost fly under the radar of having applied a fragrance.\nThere is nothing fresh, floral, sweet, gourmand, aquatic, spicy, or particularly loud about this.\nThough I am aware it contains a synthetic or 2 (Iso E Super, Cashmeran, etc.), this is a very natural-smelling scent. Natural in the sense that it does not scream \"HEY! I AM WEARING COLOGNE\" (ahem...see 1 Million)\n\nIt conjures the vision of  a rugged gentleman in a wool suit , reading a leather-bound book in a library, while chewing on a licorice root.\nDifferent things spark my interest when it comes to a fragrance. Overall there is something that must be unique, or endearing about the ones I enjoy greatly.\n\nEncre Noir is unique in a minimalist sense. Strictly business.\nThis is a linear scent, so do not expect a wide range of notes playing tag with each other. That is okay, because what this juice delivers is a sobering dose of earthy Vetiver. Within the note of Vetiver itself, there is a myriad of complexity which is downright pleasing. This speaks to high-quality tastes, and a refined demeanor. This speaks to those who appreciate the rewards of tireless work. This fragrance says \" I am not afraid to get my hands dirty\". This fragrance dispenses with the frivolities and gets to the point.\n\nNot green/grassy, or wet/grassy, in any sense, this frag instead is brown/grassy, toasted/grassy. A full aroma similar to something refined or malted.\nThere is a slight Licorice note present for the first 20 minutes or so, but this fades into a Vetiver backdrop. There is also a Cypress note present which lends some sharpness to the composition, but make no mistake, this is a Vetiver scent.\n\nI find it hard to visualize someone under 25 being able to appreciate this one. This is a fragrance that someone who can discern and appreciate a fine single-malt scotch would enjoy.\n\nThis can be used on any occasion where the mood is subdued or professional. Not a club or party scent....unless it is a Country Club, or political party.\n\nLongevity is great, but it is a bit of a skin scent after @ an hour.\n\nThis one is very heat-reactive, so easy on the Summer sprays, but this cuts through the winter chill quite nicely.\n\nIf you are a fan of austere scents, this is an absolute must-buy.\n\n\n4.7/5 in my book -love it.", "34": "They say hair grows where you spray Encre Noire.

Encre Noire, black ink in french, is a suiting name for this quality fragrance. The slightly smoky vetiver is the star of the show, and it is a great show with a powerful start and a comforting dry down. The perfume is a masterpiece in all its simplicity, very well thought through, from the note compositions to the beautiful bottle. I think Encre Noire works best in colder weather, but i am fairly certain it works year round on the right person. This is the kind of perfume i\u00b4m looking forward to wear, and i find myself using it as a good mood enhancer. Its great value for money. I would recommend this to all men, maybe not boys, who think they are man enough to do this fragrance justice. I don\u00b4t agree that it is a unisex perfume, it has a slight sweetness, but the vetiver is clearly masculine in this scent.

It's unlike anything I've ever smelled, and I'm struggling to find words that would make adequate comparisons, but here goes.\n\nFirst impression: ink. Dark ink, slightly bitter, almost a black vinyl smell. Who knew that ink or vinyl would be a scent you'd enjoy smelling like this?\n\nSecond impression: earth, grass, dark moss, wet lawn. That's undoubtedly the vetiver, doing its thing here, and it's doing its thing here very, very well. This is a wonderful vetiver note.\n\nThird impression: is that something salty? I swear there's some kind of salt note in this. Must be an anomaly of how the other notes are interacting with each other.\n\nWith as dark and heavy as this fragrance is, the low projection and just-below-average longevity should come as no surprise. That's how you want a fragrance like this to perform, quietly, subtly, like a low dust cloud.\n\nPersonally, I love this fragrance, and I wear it in the cold weather when it's ok to be a bit more heavy-handed with the application.\n\nBut this scent will not be for everyone, I can guarantee it. I do not recommend a blind buy.

I wouldn't say it's a linear scent - on me it develops, opens and surprises me. The opening is strong, fresh, herbal mixture (which I didn't really like at first), then it becomes softer, more woody and more smoky. Fresh cut, a bit wet magical herbs. It's not listed, but I smell some crushed, aromatic black currant leaves. The dry down on me is quite warm, smoky, hugging. This is not every usual wood burning, it's some kind of expensive wood sort, so the smoke is aromatic, thick, but doesn't make me suffocate, but I rather enjoy this scent. The perfume doesn't scream \"The real Man!\", it's subtle, it comes and goes, and comes back... A natural unisex (in my opinion) spell/ smell.\nThis \"ink\" makes me think about magic, about fairy tales, about a parallel world, about an enchanted forest and the beings dwelling there. Maybe with this ink The Brothers Grimm wrote their most beautiful fairy tales?", "39": "oh my GOD. I blind bought this and it arrived today. I was a bit nervous because I am just now venturing into more masculine frags, as a woman. But I am absolutely in AWE of this. \nIt's so earthy. So rich and heavy. But not overpowering in a headache kind of way, I really wish it was more powerful actually because I've just been spraying it on myself non stop trying to reexperience the opening over and over. \n\nI went to a niche perfumery in San Francisco about a month and a half ago and the salesperson showed me Comme des Gar\u00e7ons - Blackpepper. Encre Noire smells soooooo much like this but at a fraction of the price, and with a beautiful elegant bottle that looks like an inkwell.

I loved the fresh vetiver of it, and so I discovered 'Encre Noire' by Lalique. \n\nSince here were over 800 comments here regarding 'Encre Noire', I didn't consider it worthwhile to be writing another one -> but something happened. \n\nI love wearing 'Encre Noire', because of it's freshness. It has a more powerful vetiver note, than Terre D'Hermes - and that was what I was looking for. However, when my husband wears it, I sense somehow a field of wildflowers. There are no flower notes listed above and I can't sense any of them when I wear the fragrance. But probably the fragrance develops differently on him. I simply love it on my husband.

Every day I drive by a mountain meadow which lies flat and low by the the side of the road. At certain times of the year it has this pall of mist hanging over it in the mornings. If you wind the window of the car down as you drive through this mist, it smells of old churches. Old churches which are rarely frequented by worshippers. Encre Noir smells exactly the same. A rooty vetiver, far from the zingy green vetiver of say, Creed, and I\u2019m talking about the version available pre-2008 with Millesime clearly marked on the bottle. Longevity is good, you particularly notice the lingering smell on clothes, even after some considerable time - several weeks.", "42": "This proves once and for all that \"for men\" and \"for women\" is simply marketing.  On me, as a woman, this is glorious.  Its the smell of peace, crackling fire and solitude.\n\nUpdated:\n\nDespite all the comments about how masculine this is, on me its anything but.  My husband loves it, and he usually dislikes it when I wear perfume.  It's not flowery, fake feminine, but truly strong Hepburn type woman who will kick your @$$ and take names, but look like a goddess doing it.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nI've now tried Chanel Sycomore, which everyone seems to think is the \"better\" Vetiver.  It's a lovely smell, and I think I'm going to experiment layering almond or sandalwood with my Encre Noire to add that sweetness (it IS nice) but the silage and lasting power just isn't there.

This smells like a fallen tree, very old, very damp and covered with moss & creeping plants in the middle of a northern forest at night. It gives you this dark, smoky, woody smell. Droplets of water keep dripping onto it from leaves of other trees above giving it a wet smell, cool to the nose. Underneath it is dark soil that breaks easily by your own feet, adding a dark green & pleasant natural smell of damp dirt. As it goes into it's drydown state which will only take about 10 to 15 minutes, the woody smell will turn smokier & will calmly mist over everything around it, like a light breeze has carried it's scent, allowing you to smell the wood easier without getting close to the old fallen tree. Added with more water as if it's raining lightly. Combined together, you'll get a very natural & pleasant mix of dirty wood, and cool damp air mixed with water that sometimes make my mouth water. This dark scent can be played at your own will. You can choose to be mysterious, you can act gloomy, try to be soothing, alluring, or all of them at once.\nLongevity of this is just over 10 hours (seemingly). I've tried spraying it twice into my bag, it dissapeared after over 12 hours, but for the next 3 days I sometimes get a whiff of it whenever I open my bag.\nContains ISO E Super so you'll be more prone to olfactory fatigue. I couldn't smell this after 2 hours once, but received 4 compliments throughout the day during the times I can't detect it's scent.\n\nProjection is moderate but strong. It only radiates up to your elbow's length but it stays that way throughout most of it's fragrance life.\n\nSillage, it's thick and makes up for the lack of projection. I sprayed it twice on the back of my friend once over the shirt. About 5 hours later everytime I walk past behind him I'll pick up the scent and will smell it for the next 5 seconds that I walk.\n\nThe shortened, yet powerful projection, to me, is an advantage since you will be able to use it for times when you want to get up close with a woman & start a lovely conversation & have a pleasant flirty time together.\n\nBeautiful bottle & packaging, very elegant, also cheap!! The quality of something that would normally cost 150 dollars :) Not a hint of anything synthetic about this.", "45": "I was in a quest for myself to find a masculine and unique fragrance that could be used in an office environment. First, I wanted to see the popularity of fragrances on this planet. I entered the Fragrantica, clicked the \"perfumes\" link, unchecked the \"female\" and \"shared\" boxes, thus I was able to see only masculine scents.\n\nI gazed upon them... I already knew, owned or tried the first three rows. YSL la nuit de l'homme, Fahrenheit, Terre d'Hermes, Le Male, 1 Million etc. Then, I saw it: \"Encre Noire\"\n\nI said \"Wtf is that?\", opened its page and looked at its notes. Wow! Wood... My favorite note. I started to read the reviews... for five days! All and each of them!\n\nPeople was talking about wood, smoke, uniqueness and masculinity, which were all I just wanted to see in a perfume. I decided to make a blind buy based on those reviews.\n\nNow, I am holding its heavy bottle in my hands and smelling the epitome of uniqueness.\n\nI cannot describe the notes from top to down but what I primarily smell is weed smoke, in a good way, and a wooden cabin. This perfume is incredible! Projection is not enormous, so I think it is safe for office use in both summer and winter.\n\nBy the way, my native language is Turkish, and French pronunciation of \"Encre Noire\" sounds very cool to my ear! :)\n\nThank you all reviewers for informing me this gem.\n\n\nEdit: Sometimes I ask my wife and daughters their opinions for my fragrances. Today I found a tester for Bvlgari au the Blanc. I put a piece of it on my skin and have it smelled to my daughter. \"What do you think about this\", I asked. \"Well, it's quite nice\", she replied. Since I also tested Encre Noire with her, I asked her to compare the two fragrances.\n\nI asked: \"Which one is better?\"\nShe said: \"Oh, this one (au the Blanc) is just a perfume but the previous one (Encre Noire) was not. It was different. There is something more with it.\n\nAnd my daughter is 14 years old!", "46": "Wow. Deep, dark, relaxed, refined, smooth, smouldering,   smart, seductive, warm, alluring, confident - the expletives are endless.\n\nMy new signature scent for Winter/Autumn/early Spring.\n\nEnough said. :o)\n\nEdit: Loving the \"Black Ink\" and you know it just hit me this is not too far removed from another favourite of mine - Antonio Puig's Quorum - Silver. \n\nDon't get me wrong Encre Noire is easily the superior of the two but there are similarities for sure. QS is peppery-dry-zesty-citrus whereas EN is woody-smoky-dry-citrus (heavy on the smoky). :o)", "47": "I am 21 year old male. \n  I just received it in the mail and sprayed a bit on the piece of paper, I was scared because of how polarizing it is when I was reading the reviews, but I really wanted to pull that trigger and blind buy it, a lot of people said it's good for the times when you are feeling depressed and for rainy days so I really wanted to get it as I live in Washington state and rains here are almost everyday occurrence from September to May. \n  As I sniffed it anxiously being afraid that I wasted money on a blind buy again, I was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me of the old village house my great grandma had I used to visit often when I was a kid and lived in Russia. It got that moist smell of a small, old wooden building with earthy floors where my great grandparents used to store old wooden tools, I personally love that smell and it makes me nostalgic, if you have lived your whole life in a city you might not get me trying to explain this smell but it got something more to it, like a forest smell in the background. \n  I understand the comments about it smelling like death and gothic, but I just have different associations with it and I love it. I will edit my review it when I get to wear it more. Seem to last as a skin scent from 8 - 12 hours.\nEdit:\nI heard it was reformulated since alcohol percentage in it changed.\nBy no means it's a smell of death, it's not gothic, and not depressing at all. It's a very pleasant woody scent on my skin, I love it, and people around me seem to like it on me, although the projection is weak, it's long lasting and I get whiffs of it for 8 hours. It's something you would wear for yourself and intimate encounters, it's alluring, versatile and unique. It can be easily worn anytime of the year. Not offensive at all. It smells clean to me, I don't really get earthy notes much anymore from it. Of paper it smells different, and I think people just smell the first seconds of opening and never try it again when they comment bad things about it. I even got comments that it's the best cologne I have worn. Safe blind buy, just give it a chance, it's honestly not what you expect from it after reading reviews.", "48": "This fragrance, along with many others (including, but not limited to, Encre Noire, Terre d'Hermes, Aventus, Fahrenheit, etc) would do well to list Iso E Super as one of the main notes, because it is prevalent in these perfumes to say the least. \n\nOften times, we will see vetiver listed on the notes chart, but, in these instances, we are really smelling Iso E Super.  Many people say the aroma of Iso E Super is similar to vetiver. \n\nAll perfumes include aroma chemicals, but not all perfumes are overloaded with one particular aroma chemical.  See the page for Sauvage - Ambroxan, an aroma chemical, is at the top of the Notes list.  So should Iso E Super be listed at the top of the Notes lists of the aforementioned perfumes.  \n\nThe only fragrance I can recall seeing on Fragrantica with Iso E Super listed in the notes is Molecule 01..... because that is all Molecule 01 is -- Iso E Super diluted with perfumers alcohol. \n\nI LOVE the smell of Iso E Super.  Some say it smells like vetiver and/or cedar and/or other \"woody notes\".  Some say it smells like clean skin.  I finally was able to put in layman's terms what it smells like to me.  I recently got a used copy of Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\", a printing from 1976.  Iso E Super smells like the pages of that work of art.  \n\nSo too are Encre Noire, Terre d'Hermes, Aventus, and Fahrenheit.  Works of art. \n\nThe cypress note and cashmeran (another aroma chemical) are role players, character actors. Iso E Super is the unsung star of this particular show, and many others as well.  This perfume is a great example as to just how great a \"synthetic\" smelling perfume can be, because this is about as synthetic, literally speaking, as a perfume can get. \n\nLastly, I agree with recent reviewers that it is not as dour or goth as earlier reviewers claim.  I feel that it is just the third member of the Terre d'Hermes / Aventus / Encre Noir triumvirate.  See a review a few spots below this one.  Terre d'Hermes features orange (and armpit), Aventus features pineapple and birch, and Encre Noire features cypress and cashmeran.... all riding on top of an Iso E Super overload. \n\nRecommended.", "49": "So this is vetiver. Okay. In that case I like vetiver.\n\nEncre Noire smells like smoke, tar, moss, rotting leaves, forest floor, liquorice, dust and evergreen trees. It also somehow reminds me of the Finnish candy Sisu. The man pictured in the ad has absolutely nothing to do with this fragrance, someone pass him a bottle of Aventus, that fits him trying way too hard to look fiercely seductive much better.

But atlast you enslaved me into your masses.  \nClean Lemony green apple crispness giving way to cedars commanding entrance. I think this is a wonderful summer fragrance. It sooths away any rough edges of the day. I constantly bring my wrist to my nose for a fix. On me it hangs close to the skin after the first hour.

I don't know but I personally often sway towards this one in winter more than summer. I love the bitterness of the citruses in the cold morning air, I love how fresh and awakened it makes me feel, it gives me a boost on those winter mornings when all i want is to lie in bed. It is a very motivating, uplifting scent. The cedar makes it very wintry, i associate cedar with winter, it is the fresh ripe cold feel that note evokes in me. \nI don't know why this scent isn't listed as powdery, as it definitely is powdery and powdery scents are my favourite. I would say this fragrance was a citrus powdery slightly floral scent which is aromatic within the first 30 minutes of spraying after it settles into a pleasant chilling fresh citrus scent. \nI like it, I feel clean, energised, motivated, awakened. It makes me feel sporty but not in a innocent generic way. It has that bite an bitterness about it, This perfume has a certain charm. I find it with a lot of citrus fragrances they are the perfect balance between naughty and nice. Dirty enough to evoke a sense of mystery and magnetism yet nice, comfortable and composed enough for everyday wear.  \nI'm a big fan of citrus scents and this is one of my favourites, JPG CLASSIQUE X being my number one, this perhaps comes a close second.  \nP.s. this is one of those fragrances that does deserve the hype it gets unlike a few others in the market. e.g. lady million or marc jacobs.  \nI like it, it is a fresh citrus powdery winter scent which is happy uplifting but with that bite and bitterness all the while.  \nI can imagine this perfume being very fitting for the risqu\u00e9 passionate intimate encounters, it just has that smell and that nitty gritty feel.", "4": "There's a reason this fragrance has been so very popular. It's because it smells good, is exceptionally easy to wear, and is highly versatile: appropriate for day or night, for work or play, for going out to dinner or for just slobbing around the house. Part of the reason for that versatility, I suspect, is the pure simplicity of its concept: it basically comes down to two equally high-pitched and nasal facets--the sharp musky cedar below and the tart lemon/apple above--oscillating against each other to eternity. The result is a kind of olfactory moire effect, shimmery and (to my nose, anyway) quite pleasant. \nI suspect that Light Blue may also carry an additional appeal to Americans in particular, due to the strong hygienic associations of its three major notes, each of which, in their own way, can be said to represent cleanliness. Lemon, of course, is very strongly associated with cleaning products, while that tart green apple note is commonly used in the US to scent shower gels, shampoos, and astringent facial toners. The cedar, meanwhile, brings to mind cedar-lined linen closets or cedarwood chests, used to keep stored clothing clean and fresh and safe from moths. Put them all together, and you're definitely appealing to a desire for cleanliness, or \"freshness.\" I tend to associate that desire with American tastes -- we do so love the whole squeaky-clean aesthetic here!--but perhaps it is more universal than I realize.  \nMy one criticism of this fragrance is that it can get a little screechy sometimes. I referred above to both the cedar and the tart fruit facets as \"high-pitched and nasal,\" and while I realize that I'm engaging in an aural analogy there, it's the best way I can think of to describe exactly what I mean. They're both sour, sharp, astringent fragrance types, the sort that can really seem to get all the way up into your sinuses sometimes. Since I enjoy sharp and astringent smells, I'm not bothered at all by that aspect of Light Blue, but I can certainly see how it might get in the way of others' enjoyment. That synthetic cedar in the base (is that the Iso-E-Super people so often talk about?) is also extremely long-lasting and tenacious in a stickily pervasive musk-like way -- should you take a dislike to it, you *will* be smelling it for days, not only wherever you sprayed it, but also on anything and everything that got too close to the original spray. You have been warned. \nSadly, while I enjoy Light Blue on other people, it doesn't behave very well on me. When I wear it myself, the lemon and apple notes disappear very quickly, while the cedar becomes *ludicrously* accentuated; the end result is that I wind up walking around for hours smelling very much like a hamster cage. A clean hamster cage, mind you, but still very much a hamster cage. So it's not one that I keep around, but I always enjoy smelling it on others. Fortunate indeed for me!, because this fragrance is so very, very popular that once you know what it smells like, you will find yourself encountering it *everywhere*.", "5": "\u00d6zgehan lived across the hall from me freshman year.

The first time I wore this, it was on a beach trip with some friends.

Since then, Light Blue has been in my permanent perfume rotation for whenever I want to feel really fresh and clean (it's seriously perfect for right after a long day at the beach). Whenever I wear this around the house, my husband compliments me.  Whenever I wear this out in public, someone compliments me.  Whenever I wear this around friends or family, someone compliments me.\n\nCrowd pleasers may very well be considered \"boring\" to a lot of people, and that's fair.

I'm a oriental-, gourmand-girl through and through, I love vanilla but I can't run around wearing Hypnotic Poison in July can I? It's already so hot here in Sweden to my surprise and I've been wearing this all week. It was a blind buy but I remember my mothers sister wearing this when I was younger. I always gazed longingly at the beautiful perfume bottle on the shelf in her bathroom. I've been drawn to this scent ever since and finally got around to try it. Speaking of the bottle; I just adore it. So clean and classy. The beautiful matte glass flacon, the stylish, delicate details, the soft, velvety box the bottle comes in. I have the 25 ml bottle and it's just adorable.\n\nThe opening is very heavy on the citrus. Initial blast smells like I've just sprayed lemon juice on me. As the scent developes it becomes more nuanced. The woodsy notes of the cedarwood comes through strong on me and the musk as well. The amber is just the icing on the cake. It's nice to have a fresh, light summer scent that isn't aquatic. I love my L'eau D'issey but it's nice to change it up. This will get a lot of use this summer. Only downside is longevity and sillage. Sillage is fine however since it gets boosted in this heat and I don't like a very big sillage anyway. I'm usually an undersprayer, tops 3 sprays, usually just 1. I have to go to TOWN on this one, I do 6 sprays. This one I think needs to be reapplied but that is usually the case with citrus-heavy scents, right?\n\nI think this works for any woman on most occasions.

I'm not a fan of strong, offensive fragrances so LB is perfect.  It's fresh, citrusy (lemons & grapefruits) and a touch fruity. I see a lot of comments saying that everyone wears light blue. I must agree with that.  I know at least 4 coworkers that wear LB and I've run into the scent at weddings,  grocery stores, the bank... etc. But, let's face it.  Everyone wears it for a reason.  It smells good! I wore it today and I got a few compliments.  I could not smell it on myself anymore but obviously it lasts longer than we may think. I sprayed at 8 am and it was 4 PM when a man asked what perfume I was wearing.  He said it smelled gorgeous.  I will continue to wear for as long as it's sold.", "17": "i think Mr Oliver Crisp leave his signature in all his fragrances..i really can detect the same vibe in Black XS for men , Versace Man eau fraiche and this light blue for women..and this signature is the secret of the success of every fragrance Oliver create.\nLight Blue is totally unisex fragrance and it can easily be worn by men , it is very fresh , light , attractive yet not weak.\n\n.Longevity: 10/10 it lasts all day on skin\n.Sillage: 10/10 incredible the scent trail this eau de toilette leaves Just like Black XS do.\n.Scent: 10/10 SEDUCTIVE\ni recommend this for everyone , give it a try , dont smell it directly on skin or paper , you will smell it very strong and harsh due to the citrus , but smell it from distance by moving your hand or the paper and this is how people will smell you because for too many fragrances, the projected scent is different from the one on skin , i dont mean totally different but the projected is the same scent but in another better way than on skin. whatever it is really a good perfume in a nice bottle.\n10/10", "18": "I\u2019m a guy and I sometimes wear this because my wife has it in her collection. Sometimes when I get tired of my 60+ summer mens perfume with their strong citurs vibe, I go for my wife\u2019s perfume wardrobe and reach for this without hesitation. I like wearing this when I just want a light citrus and little sweetness for very hot days. There are times when I just want to wear a plain white shirt, shorts and white snickers then spray my wife\u2019s D&G Light Blue and not my own light blue or other summer colognes. I think, I\u2019ll have to buy one for me and one for my wife when her light blue runs out and it\u2019s going to be soon.", "19": "I'm a guy and I literally went on a hunt to find this, just to find out what smelled so good on girls who wear it.  Maybe it's just my DNA, but this is definitely the pinnacle of seductive fragrance for women. Any girl who wears this will be highly favored.  I'm not saying fragrance will cover up bad looks and bad attitude but if you keep yourself together and top your look off with this, you might get a guy to marry you.  It's that serious lol.  Seriously, the sexiest thing I've ever smelled on a female.  Just so you know how I judge women's fragrance, the fragrance Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy was second in my preference on a female.  It was second, but the gap between second and first was huge.  D&G light blue had a huge lead.  Any other fragrance is just for your own enjoyment, the other fragrances like Chanel, Versace, Gucci etc weren't that attractive except one Versace I smelled which would have made third. \n\nAnyway, this is the winner and top dog of female fragrance.  Sillage is good because I smelled the scent trail when around tons of people.  Not sure of longevity because I don't wear perfume.     \n\nTake it from a man.\n\n10/10 * Scent\n?/10 Longevity\n10/10 Sillage   (Radiates within 6 feet) But scent trail and quality is 10\n\nP.S. Seriously, if you are looking for a fragrance others can enjoy and one you might enjoy or tolerate get this. Men will definitely notice you no doubt.  The only risk is that people might not know who is wearing this.  If we find out it is you, you are gold.  Make it clear you are wearing this because when guys smell this, it is our goal to figure out who smells so good because the fragrance is superb. I wish I could write more but those are my words of the day. PEACE", "20": "Confession: I used to despise this perfume. I first tried it a little over a year ago and hated it. But today I gave it a second chance.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that Light Blue is a huge departure from my usual preferences. I am not into Clean and Fresh at all. But summer is upon us and it's starting to get pretty damn hot here in North Carolina, and my trademark spicy orientals and heavy gourmands are getting suffocating and headachey.\n\nI was out shopping today in the 90-degree heat and remembered there was a Belk in the same shopping center and decided on a whim to go browse the fragrance counter. I already had tester strips of about four different fragrances when I spotted Light Blue. I recalled the last time I put it on. It was a 60-something-degree day in late March and I made the mistake of spraying it directly on my neck. It was as if I had doused myself in lemon-scented furniture polish. But I've heard how well Light Blue performs in the heat, so I decided to give it another go.\n\nI ventured two sprays, one on the inside of each elbow, and let it settle and warm up on my skin. In five minutes, it was like I was wearing a completely different fragrance from the one I tried on last spring. Where once I smelled harsh cleaning products, I now smelled zippy citrus that allowed crisp apple and sparkling bamboo notes to shine through. In the heat of the afternoon, it was incredibly refreshing rather than overwhelming and artificial. I now know that Light Blue really needs heat to truly live up to its potential and I will officially add it to my fragrance wardrobe when I get my next paycheck.", "21": "My husband and I resently went on vacation, to Tenerife, with his family.\nOn our last evening the two of us went to dinner, at a nice restaurant. \n\nThere was this nice, and very serviceminded waitress, and she smelled so good. \n\nI just had to ask her what she was wearing. She told me, that it was Light blue, from Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nThe next day when we had to go home, we had some time in the airport, so I went and bought a bottle of this. I like the scent very much, and it will always remind me of a very romantic evening with my husband.\n\nPs. Ofc. We gave the waitress a great tip ;)", "22": "The olfactory equivalent of a designer white t shirt--androgynous, clean, casual, nice to wear in hot weather. Does anyone need to pay designer prices for a t shirt? Not really, but some people appreciate the subtle details in the stitching.\n\nThe composition is sheer and transparent. The citrus teeters on the brink of shrillness, but is saved and grounded by the cedar and musk. Light Blue is a well done, suburban preppy scent, with zero sweetness. It has polite hand shake sillage and longevity.\n\nMy husband bought me this, but has never commented on it. Like a pair of light blue jeans, Light Blue is likeable and approachable, but makes no demands for attention. So inoffensive it\u2019s almost mute, Light Blue has an undeniable catalog model romping blondly with a golden retriever kind of prettiness.  I used up most of a bottle effortlessly.", "23": "There is nothing else that smells quite like Light Blue. It is a bit of a legend in its own time...like Dior Poison, Lolita Lampika and Angel...When you smell someone wearing them, they are unmistakable because they are so unforgettable. With that said, this one to me, smells the way freshly cut lemons smell as you plop them into a summer cocktail. Mixed with that is the distinct smell of Pez...a candy I adored as a child...and the smell of Pez was a big draw to the candy for me, too! In the background..way, way in the back is a fresh, clean, aquatic-musk. Very interesting. Yes, a bit cloying--but it does have great lasting power. And I have yet to meet a man who does not love this on a woman.", "24": "I have to be one of the last people to own this scent because I hate buying perfumes during the time they are \"new\" or being really pushed because I feel too many people wear it at that time so it does not feel special. I want my scents to feel special to me. \n\nI, just this summer, started wearing this perfume and I can totally see why it is so popular. This is my go to fragrance when the weather is hot. This is one of those fragrances I don't have to think about. I just grab it and spray! \n\nAs far as notes, I for sure pick up on the lemon. To me, it is like a sugary lemon and as someone mentioned before it has a Lemonhead candy vibe to it. On me, I too find that the scent does not stay linear but it actually develops. I can pick up on musky floral scents and not just the citrus. I too love the warm dry down when the sexy amber reveals itself. I feel Light Blue starts out very fresh, clean, and light but it develops into a sugary, musky, woody scent. \n\nI just wore this on the 4th and through the hot weather, grilling, and swimming I could still detect in on my skin after 8 hours. I do feel this one wears very close to the skin so I do like to layer this with the body lotion and find that I can get away with 3-4 sprays (chest...stomach...back of my neck). I find guys tend to LOVE this perfume. I don't know what it is really but it seems like it turns them on.", "25": "I had quite a rocky start with Light Blue, I found to be sharp and overly citrusy, bordering unpleasant. But I wasn't ready to give up on it since I know that its quite a celebrated fragrance. After wearing it a couple of times, it has really grown on me! I find that it lasts better on clothes than on skin. Light Blue is nothing like the stuff I would usually wear. At the risk of sounding cheesy, its like a breath of fresh air. Its a simple, clean woody citrus fragrance that could easily be classified as unisex. Palette cleansing, invigorating and sometimes, a scent like this is exactly what you would need to get a break from regular sweet, floral or fruity scents. The weather in my part of the world is humid and rainy at present, and whenever I wear Light Blue, it's crisp and fresh scent just makes me smile!", "26": "A couple of years ago a client came in and both me and my colleague almost fainted from bliss when we caught a whiff of her perfume. It was the most lovely scent I had ever smelled, it was such a perfect blend of juicy citrus, cedar and bamboo. The entire effect was so well balanced and we both smelled something that neither of us could identify. It turns out she was wearing Light Blue. Both me and my colleague (who is not into perfumes at all by the way) rushed out to get ourselves a bottle of this magical elixir.   \n\nOn my skin Light Blue opens a little harshly, the lemon is very pronounced and a mixture of lemon juice and lemon peel. Then it settles into a sweeter \u201cfriendlier\u201d scent with gentle whiffs of bamboo peeking through every once in a while. The cedar note is what I enjoy most about this though I find it really pleasant. Interesting enough my mom smells a strong musk in this especially in the dry down which I do not pick up on at all. She is sensitive to musk and normally dislikes musk, if you have a similar sensitivity test this one before buy and especially allow it to settle for a few hours before you decide. It is a great fragrance for hot weather, although it is my colleague\u2019s signature scent she wears it all year. I really like this but I doubt I will repurchase once it runs out. It is nice and refreshing on me but somewhat boring on my skin chemistry. Neither me nor my colleague fully experienced the magic that client did who introduced us to Light Blue. I guess it is her skin chemistry that brings out the full magic in this, I am infinitely envious of her and all other people who pulls this off in such an indescribably beautiful way. If Light Blue smelled like that on me I would never wear another perfume in my life.", "27": "Straight male here ,\nD and g light blue can absolutely be worn by both males and females in my opinion \nIt\u2019s fresh, aquatic,citrusy, and perfect for the summer \nI actually prefer this over a the men\u2019s version", "28": "I feel sorry for people whose skin this doesn't work on! It's one of the best perfumes ever made, edgy, sexy, cool and modern. This is the only perfume I just have to re-buy every once in a while. I'm so happy it works like a miracle on my skin, truly one of the most memorable scents a woman can have. I feel like I don't even have to explain, people who get this perfume know what I'm talking about.:) (PS; I'm actually a gourmand lover, so to say this about Light Blue really means something.) Amazing masterpiece and I will love it forever. :)", "29": "I don\u2019t care that it seems to be cool to dislike his fragrance. This was one of my first perfumes and it will always be one of my favorites. Great for summer.", "30": "I enjoy this fragrance, I think of it as my blue jean perfume. It's comfy, feels good and a great companion on any day. On me, at first it has a peach or pear scent, eventually easing into a nice floral-ish, woody scent. It's easy to wear, and safe, without giving the impression that you are trying hard to get noticed. Great as a casual, everyday, not-in-the-mood to get dressed up fragrance, yet has dimension.", "31": "This fragrance can be a fantastic palate cleanser if you tend to favor moody chypres, dramatic orientals and exuberant florals.  Using Light Blue as a change of pace is like throwing open your windows on the first warm spring day after a long winter.", "32": "I blind bought Light Blue on recommendations from a topic I posted in the forums. First, I really like this for summer. It is citrusy but grounded. I smell a lot of cedar because my skin amplifies woods. This tends to be very unisex on me. I smell no florals, at all. \n\nI think this is fine for the summer and for office environments. I'm glad I bought it.\n\nElaborating a little on this review, I thought it was a pretty strident \"citrus cedar\" until I was outside in our 95F weather with 88% humidity. Cool, crisp, but not harsh or strident. Just clean.

Really lovely. A pretty, summery, very fresh smell and I really like it. \nSadly, it's not for me because it's too citrus-y but that's only my preference because I think they have blended the citrus smell beautifully. Definitely one I'll recomment to friends.", "35": "Whenever I wear my Light Blue, I'm always surprised more reviews don't mention the strong cedar note. On me, the cedar note is really, really prominent. I don't dislike it, but I don't love it either. I think I'm always lured by how many people like it. I don't seem to receive compliments on this one. \n\nI stumbled on a DUPE by accident. BeautiControl (their perfumes aren't in the database here), has an EDT named Sugar Sqeeze, and I just bought a bottle off ebay. I'd smelled in in the past, thought I liked it, so ordered it. I was shocked when I got it and immediately knew it smelled exactly like something I have. Within a minute, I knew: Light Blue. Even the notes are the same. If you want a cheaper cost Light Blue, this is it.", "36": "I am a man & I wear this. \n\nHonestly, Light Blue is quite unisex & first time I smell this, I have no idea this is a female perfume. I am a fan of citrusy aroma and own several citrus based perfume that more manly like Aramis Tuscany Uomo & Aramis New West.\n\nThis is much better smell than Light Blue Pour Homme version. Try first, you might like it.", "37": "When you think of citrus frags, you have a clear perception about how it should smell like. This gem is a perfect example for that. Very clean, refreshing, amazing, the only citrusy scent that I like. \n\nLight Blue reminds me of a fresh morning beach side white i paint the scenery with pastels, the breeze, salty and fresh, inspiring and instilling energy into your fingertips to mystify your art into an enigma. I think Men love this. But I havent tested this. I always fall for this \"getting compliments\" stuff. None of the Men fragrances earned me a compliment.

This has smelled good on pretty much everyone that\u2019s worn it. It\u2019s inoffensive to me, just a fresh nice scent. I don\u2019t care for the new intense version, it has a strong opening note that I don\u2019t like. This has okay longevity, not the longest lasting but pretty good for an EDT. I think you could gift this fragrance to most women and they would like it.

I've dented about 30 percent of the perfume juice in my LB Intense before fully deciding and realizing it isn't for me. It was always turning into a super strong musky scent on me. Yes, it lasts way longer than the original LB eau de toilette, but the heavy dose of musk in there ruins it for me. I could only enjoy the first hour in that perfume. \n\nI've also tried the newest version, LB italian zest, which is the one I have contemplated in buying since it was really beautiful in the opening but it turns sour on me. I felt something was off from it because it has heavy dose of lemon. \n\nSo to satisfy my cravings for this scent.\nI've decided fo just come back to the this original LB eau de toilette.

It could have been the most expensive mistake of my perfume life... \nI discovered this from the most lovely Demi Rawling and her channel on YouTube and honestly, after watching all of her videos where she has talked about this gem I was convinced - I would love this and went ahead and bought the full bottle from the only online shop where we can get PDM here in Sweden. Felt a little fun to take a risk like that.  \nFirst - the bottle. It\u2019s the most beautiful perfume bottle I\u2019ve ever seen and the prettiest in all of my collection. The lid itself weighs more than a brick of gold. Feels expensive (as it is). \nWhen I first sniffed it I was so very intrigued. It had this fresh, feminine and crispy feel to it and I was seriously hesitant to spray this on my skin. \nOn me this is a pretty flowery, fresh, litchi and rhubarb scent. I don\u2019t really detect any rose, maybe just a hint. It\u2019s sweet but not at all like candylike gourmand scents. It leans more on the fresh/flowery side. I think it\u2019s the rhubarb that makes this perfume so interesting. I\u2019ve never smelled anything like it and it stands out in my collection. \nI\u2019ve liked it from the start but once it hit my skin and really dried down I was sure - it\u2019s a love for me. I feel so feminine, fresh and beautiful when I wear this and I imagine I could wear this one either in summer or winter. I actually can\u2019t wait to try this beauty out in the summer.  \nLongevity and silage is beast mode on me. And I\u2019ve got like a trillion compliments when I\u2019ve worn this the few days I\u2019ve own it. It\u2019s a perfect match for me and a very very successful blind buy.

It's so bright and crispy and a beautiful spring/summer fragrance. It reminds me of Tahiti in the summer idk why. Very feminine and elegant fragrance.\nDelina is a compliment getter and it seems to be a big crowd pleaser. \nI'm determined on buying a bottle one day.\nNow I'll just have to save up for a trip to Paris since shipping to my country will probably cost me in total 450-500 USD.", "3": "So I bought a sample of PDM Delina for my girlfriend, and damn I was blown away!

I am enjoying gourmand rose scents at the moment so initially disregarded it, although the first hit was lovely; I didn't detect anything I was looking for (even though I wasn't looking for perfume..!). I liked it well enough to toddle off with my tester strip in my purse, something I always do to see how a scent develops over time, and got on with my day.\n\nAs my day went on I tested numerous other scents and the strip got demoted to a bag of new clothes, and then forgotten...\n\nThe next day I raided my sweet smelling purchases for a work outfit and set out for the office...

The fruit has settled into a subtle rhubarb/lychee blend and the delicious flowers shine through.\n\n12 hours on and the base vanilla is pretty much all that remains on the skin, but on fabric all the middle notes are going strong, the leather has taken on a sensual smokey tone that just makes you think \"mmmmmm\".\n\nIs it worth \u00a3175+? Questionable, there are cheaper scents that last longer on the skin. Do I regret buying it? Not in the slighest, this is a scent that celebrates sensuality; delicate yet insistent, innocent yet enticing.

This smells like creamy/musky tart berries and flowers rounded by vanilla and woody notes. Fruity and musky clean. I can definitely see how oud could be added to the fragrance to deepen and enhance it. I've got a travel spray from FNet and it's all I need as I've got too many fragrances. A bottle is way out of my budget. I definitely want to try Delina Exclusif. -", "8": "It's not my normal type, but I completely understand the hype.

I like it better when you get wafts of it in the air or from a trail that someone else left behind rather than just smelling it directly from the source. \n\nPersonally, would I say this is my favourite fragrance of all time? No. Do I think it is pleasant? Absolutely. It's something I can easily reach for when I don't want to think about what I should wear because it has decent longevity and sillage without being offensive in any way. Many say it is just a tart and sweet fruity floral fragrance, but I do think it has a little more dimension and depth to it than that. Its main feature is the tart and juicy litchi and rhubarb mixed with a jammy and velvety rose and peony. It is sweet and juicy that is slightly uplifted without getting too heavy or cloying by the touch of freshness in it. However, it also has a velvety, soft and mushy feel to it which I assume to be from the musk and cashmeran. The entire scent feels kind of wrapped in it, giving it a more rounded and fluffy finish as opposed to completely creamy or syrupy. \n\nI wondered if I was the only one who picked up the incense, but looking at some of the comments it seems there are a few who have also noticed this. There is a very faint slightly burnt finish (which does almost disappear in the dry down), that's almost like a caramelised sugar topping. I think this gives it a slight dimension though, which makes it fresh but with a cozy and warm coating. This is what makes the magic of the people pleasing Delina, I do think it's more than just the simplicity of the typical girly litchi and rose pinkish smell. The little elements that we don't notice that have been added into the typical DNA might be what makes Delina the most appealing from its kind.", "9": "I saw this in a Demi Rawling video and I was lucky to try Delina in a duty free in Russia (niche brands are sold widely here in the main airports), two sprays at the back of my hand and\u2026 wow!\nDelina is a creamy, milky rose, with a fruity (rhubarb, strawberry and raspberry to my nose) tartness, almost like jam. There is also an opening of mint on my skin, which refreshes the fragrance and makes it even more appropriate and wearable.\nThe pink matte bottle with the lovely white cap is just perfect. If I had to envision Delina in a material, shape, or form, it would be something pink and velvety. \nThis is extremely girly and feminine, I could imagine somebody like Reese Witherspoon, a Southern Belle, wearing this, with a pink dress along with a nice glossy lipstick. \nLongevity is ok, sillage and projection are better. A beautiful fragrance, although very expensive, way too much.", "10": "I never thought I would get this never mind fall in love with it. After maybe a year or so deliberating whether or not to get this or not I finally pulled the trigger earlier this year. I left work went straight to the Boutique here in Paris to get the bottle. I do not regret this at all. \nSomeone on YT said it smells like an expensive baby or what the British royal babies smell like. I get it! \nIts very plush. Instead of describing what it smells like I would rather tell you how it makes me feel. \n\nFirst of all, after buying it I could not put it down! It makes me feel beautiful and clean and put together. I feel pretty wearing this. I get excited just to put it on. I can smell this on myself all day when I wear it. it feels like I am in a pink cloud. I stopped wearing it everyday because I want it to feel special when I wear it.  I crave this when I don't wear it.\nTo me its an exquisite fruity +fresh+ floral scent.  \nI wouldn't even care if I never got compliments because i absolutely love it.", "11": "I caved and got a decant after Demi Rawling kept talking about it, despite the fact that I dislike rose scents very much. Which is funny because for years I've worked part time at a florist, and I love love love the scent of real roses. But in perfumery I find them to be too sour. \n\nIn Delina I actually really enjoy the sour note, which I think is coming from the rhubarb and not the roses. The roses in here are sweet and plush, not sharp and loud even if they're very prominent all the way through. The color of the bottle matches the juice. It's pink. It's girly but not in an immature way. It's fun. In the dry down I get the cashmeran and musk, with a bit of the wood which makes it interesting. The rhubarb/rose party is still there though and they stay until it is all gone.\n\nMake no mistake that Delina is not a \"masterpiece\" or an \"out there\" niche fragrance. But she's lovely. It's definitely worth the money if you have it in my opinion. \n\nThe second time I wore her I was working at my flower store. I was wearing a neon yellow shirt and handling bright pink roses, Orchids and all the other beautiful flowers we had that day. The sun was peeking through the snow and Delina was giving me wafts of her all day long. It just fitted so beautifully together. And I fell for her. I'm almost done with my decant and then I'll be getting a full bottle.\n\nI would have thought that Delina would suit spring and summer best but so far she has performed surprisingly well in this deep winter we're having in Iceland right now. Today I took a long walk to the forest right next to my house and I would catch whiffs here and there coming from under my coat and it was beautiful. Everything was covered in snow, we were sitting in this incredible lush forest, listening to the silence of winter with delicate snowflakes lazily falling to earth all around us, a fox tiptoed elegantly between the bushes next to us and Delina just matched with it. Just a magical moment made better with my perfume. So, Delina won't disappoint in winter but I'm also really looking forward to trying her out in spring and summer. \n\nI also asked my boyfriend to sniff me and he can be quite fuzzy when it comes to perfumes. His verdict was \"it smells like it's naturally you, it doesn't smell like a perfume at all. Very good\".\n\nSo all in all, yes, I'd recommend Delina and I will be buying a big bottle soon.\n\nEdit: This stuff lasts in my hair like nothing else! Just a tip for Delina lovers - I always spray perfumes in my hair, just one spritz, and Delina has outstanding lasting power. I put her in my hair the other day and then didn't wash it for two days. I could smell her right until I washed my hair again. Not intensely, but I'd get these nice whiffs here and there. Just lovely.", "12": "So much hype around this, with that being said, I fell for it. Yup, I did.  I\u2019m a collector so I had to try it. First I bought a decant, for this price range I want to see if if it\u2019s something I truly will wear #1 or even somewhat like. Well I love it it. \n\nLongevity, is excellent on my skin. I do prepare my skin after shower with a non scented body lotion (CeraVe) and then I spray this on neck, lightly in hair on lower arm not wrists and I do not rub. People stop me to ask what am I wearing, that was a clue that this fragrance is right for me.  I get a sharp rhubarb and rose at first, almost spicy, then the fruit and lychee come out in dry down on me. Remember everyone has a different chemistry. \nSillage is nice, this is wear the compliments come into play. It gently follows you. \n\nThis is a super feminine fragrance, great for a wedding day fragrance. I will always have this in my collection. Can\u2019t wait to try the other PDM fragrances.", "13": "When I first tried Delina in winter I was so disappointed. All the great reviews for an average, sour, sharp fruity floral? Really?\n\nLuckily, I decided to try it again in early spring and then on the recent summery hot days with 30+\u00b0C. This is really one of those perfumes that need warm skin to magically transform into something beautiful and won't work in sub-zero temperatures at all. \nYes, in principle it smells like a typical 2000s pink fruity floral with its dominant lychee, rose and peony notes, but like a very, very well executed one. The rhubarb is a lovely addition, it's tart but delicious and makes the florals shine. Beneath these fresh notes, the drydown is warm and creamy with vanilla and cashmere. It's sweet, but never too sweet, a hint of acidic, almost green fruits stays there until the end. \n\nSo, Delina is really beautiful under the right conditions. I'm not sure if it's 200\u20ac-beautiful for me personally, but everyone who likes fruity florals should try it. Just not in the cold wintertime!\n\nEdit from February 2019: Since I wrote this review I decided that Delina is indeed worth the price for me. It's the perfect fresh 'pink' perfume.", "14": "Dear Quentin Bisch,\n\nYou have done what so many tried and continuously try to do: bottle pure magic. The first time I was ever heard of Delina was from Mila le Blanc, who poetically described it as sex in a bottle. I was surprised, because I associate a fresh fruity floral fragrance with innocent girliness rather than with pure sex appeal. I nearly forgot about Delina until I found myself in a luxury store, of course in the perfume department, when the gorgeous pink bottle caught my eye. The tester was empty, but a kind employee gave me a sample to take home. It sat in my bag for weeks, slowly being forgotten, until one night I spontaneously got asked out for a drink by a handsome and kind man I had just met. I wanted to wear a perfume that would make me feel pretty, and I remembered the Delina sample. I asked my date (who I can now call my boyfriend) *for research purposes* what he thought of the fragrance. He have it a 8.5/10. During the evening, he told me he got whiffs of my perfume, which smelled absolutely incredible. Since then, the 8.5/10 has become a solid 10/10. Later he poetically described Delina as \u201cwater that drives men crazy\u201d. I thought that was funny, but secretly loved it. He was not wrong, as he is not the only man who has told me Delina has an unexpected effect on them. He, however, is and will be the only person that gets to act on Delina\u2019s magic allure.\n\nTo illustrate this is not purely a subjective one-person experience: multiple people (men and women) have expressed the beauty and memorability of Delina. Friends of mine who rarely ever acknowledge a perfume, immediately recognise the smell of Delina. \n\nI don\u2019t know what secret ingredient you put in this perfume, Quentin, but you have created a masterpiece that will always have a very special place in my heart. Thank you.", "15": "Delina is sparkling and dynamic. The lady wearing it is successful, sexy, and noticed. \n\nI was shocked the first time I smelled it because I had never smelled anything like it so the rhubarb might be too sharp for some at first. When you revisit it, however, you can\u2019t help but be intrigued and infatuated by its utter beauty. \n\nIt lasts for days and the dry down is particularly sexy. This can be worn for the daytime and nighttime and for all seasons. Strong enough for the cold, but really blooms in the spring. \n\nIts sharpness is good to wake you up when you\u2019re tired in the morning and it can suddenly make you feel ethereal and ready to gracefully conquer the day. It makes you want to be a better person and it heightens even the simplest of moments. \n\nDon\u2019t blind buy it because it could be too strong for some and it could take some getting used to, but it\u2019s definitely worth the try. It might even be a little offensive for some work environments or for closed spaces like airplanes. \n\nBut she\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s easily one of my top three favorite fragrances for women.\n\nEdit: Dry down is spectacular and I can smell it five days later on wherever I happened to touch. For days I smell it in my hair (even after washing it twice), on makeup brushes, pillows, my room. It lasts and it projects, but in order to be noticed/get compliments  I would recommend 4-7 sprays.", "16": "Ok, I've been seeing the youtube frangrance gurus go on and on about this perfume.\nI resisted trying it because I have rationalized that it may be too popular and too expensive to purchase, so really never tried it until I was at the mall yesterday.\n\nWow.\n\nI really must say, this one is living up to the hype that I've seen.\nThe fragrance is simply gorgeous - feminine, romantic, sweet, lovely, angelic, hauntingly beautiful.\n\nThis was a \"Love at First Spray\" for me...\nThe hype is really correct with this one.\nThis is one of the best perfumes that I've EVER smelled --\nAnd I have smelled quite a LOT!", "17": "I smelled this with my mum without looking at the notes so it wouldn't cloud our judgement. I instantly thought of the Strawberry Shortcake doll I had as a kid. It had scented hair, and this is what it smelled like. Delicate, pretty, juicy, girly, fake-strawberry, rosey, yet light and fruity-fresh. Very linear and super well-blended (hence the juicy, fake-strawberry, rosey combo). My mum, on the other hand, thought it was all that but sour. I love it.", "18": "I have a sample of this and....oh boy, I am in love. Sweet and mouthwatering.  I can clearly detect rose, litchi, peony and vanilla. The scent is complex, multi-layered, seductive. I think red would be a better bottle color for it. Quentin Bisch is a genius, no doubt of that. I would buy it right away, but the price tag is not as pleasant as the fragrance :) Either way, it s on my 'want' list.", "19": "I actually prefer De Marly\u2019s unisex/male collection over the female line.  Seriously.   Herod,  Layton,  Carlisle, have you sampled them yet? All 10/10 for me. However\u2026 \n\nDelina is a masterpiece. \n\nShe was my wedding scent,  so of course, I\u2019m biased.  And I do know that she probably has been worn by many a bride on their special day,   but that hardly makes me feel less special when I wear her.  She is just that stunning and reliable. \n\nI agree with a lot of the critique,  Delina is not the most unique scent out there.  At least not anymore. The sillage and performance are moderate, though certainly projects more than a skin scent.   But I have yet to find another fragrance with a similar profile that does it better than she does. \nDelina is always creamier.\nAlways richer. \nAnd has that perfect sour to sweet balance,  at least in my humble opinion! \n\nAnd Delina smells great on my skin.  Rose has always smelt fresh and sweet and not soapy or overpowering at all when I wear it.  We just have always had that kind of chemistry ;)\n\nOn me,  I get the perfect composition between the tart nectar from the bergamot,  rhubarb, and litchi trio,  folded together by the romantic florals found in the middle notes and the creamy woody musk that follows plays the perfect support to this entire timeless medley.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if I agree with this scent being called or seen as \u2018girly\u2019.  Feminine,  for sure!   But I can see any age and any gender rocking this majestic perfume.  That\u2019s fab.  Let's all enjoy it and share it.  Delina is worth the celebration.  \n\nDelina shines in spring through to early autumn but honestly, I love her in every season!", "20": "A young, pink, girly, fruity, sweet and pretty fragrance. Reminds me of Marc Jacob's Perfect. Not so unique, and kinda basic. Even so, I still like it a lot (8.5/10). It's a very likeable scent, especially to guys, so far I haven't heard of anyone who hate it. \n\nNotes that are prominent to me: Rose, Peony, Raspberry? (maybe it's Rhubarb + Lychee), Vanilla. \n\nCompares to Delina Exclusif, this one is lighter, fresher, younger and prettier. I'd hands-down recommend it over Exclusif!", "21": "It is a nice sweet fragrance, I can't find something negative to say, it has great projection and longevity. But I really don't understand why so many YouTube reviewers are talking about it like it is a fragrance fallen from heaven.\nFor people who like moderate sweet and fruity fragrances, check this out. It is a pleasant fragrance that I would wear at work and out during the day.", "22": "I love this perfume so much. I feel extremely feminine when I wear this. It's innocent and sexy at the same time. If it wasn't so expensive this would be my signature scent. The bottle describes the scent very well, light pink, feminine, elegant, expensive. I don't think I'll ever get tired of this fragrance.", "23": "I don\u2019t care how \u201cpopular\u201d this one is, it\u2019s my signature perfume \nIt\u2019s a compliment getter and that\u2019s just another plus because I don\u2019t wait to be complemented to validate my taste in perfumes. That being said, Delina is very dreamy, sexy, sensual, makes a man go crazy quite literally ladies. \nIt\u2019s adventurous like going to a fun party or traveling with a loved one. \nIt\u2019s is a beauty in a bottle \nFeminine \nSensual\nSexy \nOne of a kind \nCompliment getter \nTrend setter \nShow stopping \nNot offensive \nGorgeous \nGood silage and lasts for a bit\nWorth your money", "24": "I did not like this perfume at first. The sourness mixed with the cedar and vetiver bothered me. But now it has definitely grown on me. The dry down captured my heart, rosey, peony, vanilla cashmere after 7 hours. So intoxicating! I\u2019ve noticed the perfumes that I didn\u2019t like at first are usually the ones I find to adore as time goes on. (For example Classique Essence) The more I wear Delina, the more I love it. It blooms in warm weather so Ive been reaching for it daily this spring! It\u2019s a versatile fragrance that you can wear in any weather. When I wear it now, the litchi, peony and rose stand out a lot and I barely notice the rhubarb. It\u2019s a fun fragrance to wear during the day, it makes me feel feminine and unique. It pairs perfectly with Method pure peace body wash. I prefer delina exclusif for night time or super cold weather. I know this is very popular in the online world but in the real world, in my life, no one knows or wears this fragrance. So who cares if it\u2019s popular on YouTube and fragrantica. Lol I wear what I love!", "25": "The initial burst is a sour, youthful and excitable rhubarb note. The background is a beautiful feminine, majestic rose. It\u2019s a very unique and unpredictable Fragrance. My brother absolutely loves it and said it reminds him of pink bon bon sweets. He also mentioned how addictive it is and he much prefers it to Exclusif. I prefer the rounded, heavy and obnoxiously sweet character of the latter though. Delina is more fresh and sour than sweet, which is why it\u2019s mouthwatering. It also comes off as far more extroverted and young. It\u2019s like a hot pink dress, whereas Exclusif is like an iced pink gown. \n\nDelina is fresh and inviting, it\u2019s a perfect summer or spring option but it has enough strength and sillage for all year round. The peonies add a gentle, girly touch and they emerge as the most prominent note, with an exotic lychee bursting forward. \n\nPerformance and longevity are excellent.", "26": "A fresh crisp rose in a beautiful bottle. \n\nThis is a high quality fragrance and the scent is very natural smelling - I imagine a well kept garden in bloom after a light rainy drizzle. So fresh and floral.", "27": "I finally tested it. When I smelled it, I though I already know it. It is very similar to Incanto Shine and to Idole by Lancome. Also reminds me of Eclat d'Arpege by Lanvin. It is inoffensive, unremarkable,smells synthetic, something a young girl would wear. I don't understand the hype at all. It's something that should cost 1/10th of what it costs. I was unsure weather to click on like or dislike icon here...It's alright, but not nearly as good as it's supposed to be.", "28": "Delina is a very beautiful perfume, and so is Delina exclusif. I can\u2019t afford to get both so what I did was I bought Lady Diana- from Alexandria fragrances. It is the clone of original Delina (smells exactly like Delina) and then I also bought Delina exclusif from Parfums de Marly!", "29": "Oh!  What a personal failure!  I was so looking forward to wearing this beautiful juice!!  and when I finally get hold of a bottle, all I hear from my partner is that I do smell like laundry detergent!!!!!!!!   The worst part is that now, that is all I smell, as well.", "30": "I have wanted to smell this for years and finally purchased a sample. Yes, it's very nice but not so wow! that I would spend $400.00 on it. It's not that unique - just smells like a lovely rose fragrance.  The PDM bottles are stunning and I wonder if that's why their perfumes are so pricey. In any case, my budget doesn't allow me to spend that much.", "31": "I absolutely ADORE this fragrance!! I'm usually more into gourmands than florals but this has me in a CHOKEHOLD!!! I blind bought the 30ml bottle and i have no regrets, in fact, i will be buying the full sized bottle. A delicious fresh floral dream that screams femininity.", "32": "Delina is a sweet, fruity-floral fragrance and I would also categorize it as quite young. The rhubarb and lychee notes make a sort of sweet-sharp nose to the perfume which I love, but could understand others disliking (in that case, look at Delina Exclusif or Ex Nihilo Lust in Paradise if the rhubarb note is too much). The rose is friendly, modern, and not overly powdery or granny-like. \n\nIt's a summertime staple in my collection, with great longevity and projection on warmed skin. It lasts forever on my skin and even longer on clothing. I'll be doing laundry and smelling delina on a shirt I wore weeks ago. \n\nSmell: 9/10\nLongevity: 10/10\nOverall: 9.5/10", "33": "The first time that i smelled this i was like wow, mother of god! The most beautiful and refined musky Rose!   Very unique smelling, pure quality.  Feminine as hell, fresh, summer, spring,clean, girly and sensual.  Pink. To die for.\n\nI think this is great casually or with any dress, even for night in the summer, but more days and effortlessly awesome outfits.\n\nThe incense can get cloying and too sharp some times. \n\nTotally worth it. Smells like a million bucks girl.", "34": "Delina is more fruity than floral, and the tartness of its rhubarb is what stands out most to me in this composition. Lychee lends an aqueous, juicy sensation in the top notes that makes for an almost thirst-quenching initial spray. But the rhubarb far outlives the lychee--it stays with you as the fragrance settles into sweet florals, soft vanilla, and cozy musk.\n\nI think the contrast between sweet and sour notes is what makes Delina interesting: it reminds me of an underripe strawberry in this way. Delina is a very likable perfume, particularly if you're looking for something that stands out among countless fruity florals. I think it may be the most popular perfume from this house, but skip it if you're not looking for popular, sweet, or safe.\n\nEDIT: So good and posh for when you want something sweet and feminine without cloying sugar. Pink was the right color for this bottle. Not powdery at all, especially for a rose scent. It's fresh and tart.", "35": "For me it's mostly about peony, rose and lychee. It's a perfect combination of mature feminity of my favourite flowers and girly fruitiness, so it's classy, but fresh and young at the same time. I feel like a fragile lady wearing it :) It also lasts whole day on me.  I'm not sure I can afford a full bottle, but it definitely goes to my wish list.", "36": "I really want to like Delina. I keep trying but it smells like rose mosquito repellant on me!\n\nAtomic rose is nearly identical to Delina to me but without the strange chemical bug spray scent. I will being purchasing that one instead", "37": "I hate to say this but I LOVE IT and I WANT IT so bad. I simply cannot pay the price of $416 for a perfume. I hate to love it. I also hate that this fragrance lasts for hours. I wish it smelled boring and lasted half an hour haha!\n\nRhubarb in rose fragrances - woah. It uplifts the rose and makes this fragrance so elegant and bright. Worth to mention that the rhubarb note is what makes this fragrance stand out. It is beautiful, tart, juicy beyond words. How lovely. I'm repeating myself - I truly wish I hated it.\n\nEdit: Having tested Delina, Delina Exclusif, and Delina La Ros\u00e9e, I can confidently say that the original Delina is my favorite. It has the perfect amount of flowers, fruitiness, and musk. Delina projects less than La Ros\u00e9e and to my surprise, La Ros\u00e9e has an even better longevity. Delina remains my favorite nonetheless.\n\nEdit #2: I'm just going to get the full sized bottle. I purchased the \"Feminine Collection\" discovery set containing 10 ml of each Delina, Delina Exclusif, Cassili, and Meliora. The more I wear Delina, the more I enjoy it and find it so very unique. It's going to be so epic for spring and summer.", "38": "I used to think I disliked anything with rose in it. Ditto fruity sweets. Enter Delina.\n\nOh my goddd. This is... gorgeous. The rose smells clear and pure and expensive. Like, more real than real roses. The fruits are tart and sweet, mouthwatering, almost like a jolly rancher (which could make it sound cheap, but it so isn't). The fruits perfectly balance the rose. It all comes together in a fresh, soft, heavenly blend. \n\nNever in my life did I expect I'd be so willing to spend $$$ on such a feminine perfume. But this is special. This is worth it. I don't care what anyone else says or how many other people are hyping it. This scent makes me so happy.", "39": "Seriously seriously lovely. I was on the hunt for a gardenia fragrance and got totally sidetracked by this one!  Gorgeous... it exudes femininity and the color pink without being cloying. I totally get those saying this being close to Mancera Roses & Vanille, but this is not quite as sweet in a dessert composition type of way.  Delina edges out Roses & Vanille for me.  The scent trail this leaves is sensual and intoxicating.  Delicate but not innocent. Love.\n\nEdit:\nReminds me ALOT of Montale intense cafe given that I don\u2019t really get the coffee note on my skin from intense cafe.  Very very similar.", "40": "This is perfection on my skin from start to finish.  I get compliments when I wear it from fragheads who always guess wrong and are surprised when I say it\u2019s Delina.  It has no hard edges on my skin, but is bright first, then softer and creamy.  The color of the bottle?  Yeah, that\u2019s how it smells on me. Best blind purchase I\u2019ve made yet!", "41": "I bought a tester of this and I see why it\u2019s so popular.  I really like it. I prefer original Delina to Delina Exclusif.  I don\u2019t need or want the creamy notes in Exclusif.", "42": "Beautiful, beautiful perfume! This is definitely a masterpiece, and I LOVE the sharp sour note of the rhubarb. Only thing is that this is very linear, I don't find the fragrance very dynamic. The dry-down smells identical to the first spray for me. Definitely a compliment getter and my husband LOVES it. Love the scent, but part of me wishes the dry-down was different from the first spray. Gorgeous scent, definitely worth it, but don't expect any dynamic changes after you spray it.", "43": "At first, I disliked it because nothing felt special about it to me. This could be because of how hyped up it is. I was taken aback by a typical floral scent that reeked like the smell of cheap ros\u00e9. Once it settled in, it all clicked. The smell radiated from my body as if I was the sun. I caught a glimpse of cashmere rose every corner I turned. I feel like a sweet, lychee milk soda from Japan when I\u2019m wearing it. Well... very much that if it was served as an expensive cocktail at a rooftop bar or something. Something about it reminds me of Vegas, as if it is something a well-respected showgirl would wear. I want to try this out during a Summer outing or visiting a piano bar. As beautiful as it is, I find it too mature for me in my early twenties for an everyday scent. Although, it is fun to pretend.", "44": "My husband says it smells like a candle. Lol he likes it a lot, but the description of it smelling like a candle isnt really selling it.\n\nThis is pink. The opening is soooo juicy pink. I would say this is like a princess fragrance. She rides a unicorn too. Her dress is outrageously big and pink. Her long hair blowing in the breeze while she feeds her unicorn some reddish pink fruit. \n\nI also agree with the lmwimsatt. She could also be a Victorian woman who is always put together. Fresh tarts are on a nearby table. \n\nWhile I do love this fragrance a lot, it isnt quite me. I tend to lean more unisex on what I like and this is feminine. And not in a purple but a ripe pink. 30+ for a woman who is put together and wears dresses often, or skirts. Business professional to casual.", "45": "Delina, Delina, Delina. I am so in love with this scent. I would not describe myself as a girly-girl. However, this bottle, this scent, this vibe all together is something I really adore. It's floral, fruity, but soo grounded and sexy with the addition of musk. It's such a dynamic and sensual blend. Now that I have this fragrance in my collection I can't see myself ever living without it.", "46": "I've owned a full bottle for about a year now, and yet I've changed my mind about this fragrance over and over again. I couldn't quite figure out if it represented me well or, simply put, if I liked it at all. At times I'd love it, at times I just couldn't stand smelling it. But now I got my final verdict, and...\n...I ultimately love it. \ud83c\udf3a \n\nChanging my mind over time has been extremely helpful though, because I could see why it's such a polarizing fragrance. Yes, the rhubarb can be a little too tart, but that's not what moves the needle for me. What does make a huge difference in how I perceive the scent is the amount of sprays - simple as it may sound.\n\nThis can be true for all fragrances, granted, but I feel it especially applies for Delina, because its lasting power (easily 24 hours and longer on clothes) will make you smell it on you all day long: one spray too much and the spell is broken. It becomes... well: too much, too intense, too tart. The line between \"omg it smells amazing\" and \"omg I can't stand this anymore\" is extremely fine.\n\nMy recommendation is to therefore only spray once, max twice, and not too close to your nose (say: chest and wrist). That's the \"just right\" amount for me. 3 becomes too much and it starts to bother me, 1 and a half or 2 and it's so yummy! \ud83e\udd24\n\nI see many people ask if this fragrance will get you compliments, be it from men or in general (I'm a woman in my 30s). This can vary depending on culture, age, contexts etc., but I myself was never complimented on Delina, not once. And I have been with people/men who typically compliment other fragrances of mine, but the rose-based ones never get me compliments (similarly, I was never complimented on Chloe EDP). \n\nDelina is perfect for those early summer days when the sun starts to peek out after a long winter, and to me it mainly works best in daytime. \ud83c\udf1e", "47": "It\u2019s very juicy and refreshing. I don\u2019t like fruity florals in general but this one I would wear. It\u2019s isn\u2019t overly sweet like most fruity perfume I\u2019ve smelled and there is no jarring synthetic note that made me think of air freshener with most fruity florals I\u2019ve tried. Excellent sillage and longevity. I wouldn\u2019t call it a sillage bomb but it leaves a beautiful trail.", "48": "This is a total goddess perfume! From opening to end, it is stunning in every aspect. A staple in my collection I reach for over and over again. So creamy and warm and sexy as can be. A total sophisticated, elegant, nude skin scent. Love! Love! Love it!", "49": "I wondered for months how this perfume smelled ! I literally have watched every YouTube video available to look up reviews on this scent and get an idea of how it smelled . I finally went ahead and ordered the new feminine discovery set with both Delina and Delina Exclusif inside and to my surprise - I hate it . The weren\u2019t kidding about the rhubarb note being off putting . The best way to describe it is GREEN AND STRONG - almost like weed and grass ??? It was overbearing . Yes I could smell the rose but it didn\u2019t matter because the pungent smell was so strong and whirling around my head . I am a girl who LOVES strong perfume and I want everyone to smell me . This took one spray to accomplish that, and then some . I didn\u2019t get a chance to let it dry down - I had to wash it off. I\u2019m so sad !\n\nUPDATE: . I sprayed it again today to give it a fair chance . To my surprise - the rhubarb note didn\u2019t overwhelm me this time . I gave it about a an hour to dry down and it is a citrus dominant rose . Bitter and sweet with a strange zesty pepper  . I give it a 6/10 ."}, "38": {"0": "My oldest son bought a bottle of this angel serum for my wife for Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s one of very few perfumes she wears that when I smell her, I can feel the scent through my entire body. \nIt works well for men as well, In my opinion. My wife and I went into Ulta for a bit as I know how much she loves perfumes. We were there for about 40 minutes just exploring the many bottles of smelly stuff. I found the Libre Intense tester bottle and damn near emptied it on myself. (sorry Ulta. No, no I\u2019m not). I love this scent so much that I\u2019m constantly threatening the Mrs. that I\u2019m going to wear it after she leaves for work. \ud83e\udd2a  \nThis cologne/perfume is the only one I would pay full price for. It made me feel confident in myself, which is something I\u2019ve struggled with \nMy entire life. This speaks volumes for this cologne. Its a very welcoming scent that when it hits me I feel like I\u2019m being hugged by an angel. It\u2019s warm and invigorating. Buy it. You won\u2019t regret it. However, if you do buy and and don\u2019t like it, send that shit my way!  \n11/10", "1": "I already wrote a brief review but coming back to share a bit more. All three Libres are EXCELLENT. I bought 10 mL purse sprays of each to decide which I like best for a fb. Ultimately I bought Libre Intense which is divine and lasts the longest.  \nIn a nutshell:\nLibre EDT: lighter, more white floral with citrus and minimal lavender and not noticeable sweetness. very nice if you\u2019re into lighter citrusy florals for warm weather. this has the lowest longevity and sillage (not enough for me)\nLibre EDP: gorgeous androgynous aromatic floral with citrus up top. Dries down to a nice floral-zesty-dried sachet of lavender vibe. Moderate longevity and sillage (3-4 hrs on me)\nLibre Intense: DROP DEAD GORGEOUS SEXY CONFIDENT AND A MASTERPIECE. Intense is an aromatic floral lavender with a vanilla base that lingers as a lavender-vanilla on me. this is everything I wanted Mon Guerlain to be. This is more androgynous-unisex than Mon Guerlain and the lavender is fresh herbal aromatic (not bug spray). This is NOT sweet. Somehow this is unique and doesn\u2019t smell like \u201ceverything at Sephora,\u201d but it does still seem current and obviously a mainstream designer style. Longevity and sillage are on the high end of moderate; this isn\u2019t beast mode, but 3-4 sprays are plenty for 5-6 hrs. I love Libre Intense and the bottle design on these is really appealing.  \nNice work YSL \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb \nPS total bosslady vibes. bring it.", "2": "I just received it yesterday and have the original on one wrist, Intense on the other...at first sniff they are quite similar, but fast they go in different directions, Intense is more rounded, smoother, whereas the original has more that aromatic lavender vibe..Intense develops a balsamic undertone, and it will be great to wear in cold weather, with its enveloping aroma..the original is more soapy, more suited for spring and summer...contrary to the other reviewers, I find Intense more feminine, I don\u2019t get why it is compared to men \u2018 colognes,and the gender propaganda as always is rubbish..it is definitely on the feminine side.. although it has v\u00e9tiver in it which pops up in the heart of the fragrance..the orange blossom is muted, but present..the original keeps more its lavender vibe throughout..both are very well done, and now that fall is around the corner, Intense will work great..Intense retains much of the original \u2018 DNA, and although it is warmer it has an airiness that remains, definitely a great perfume, the drydown is a warm cozy vanilla....puzzled as why it is being put down!", "3": "I have no words... Quite literally. I lose what little charisma and charm I just might have whenever I smell this on a woman. I'm put into a trance and turn into a bumbling idiot.  \nOne of the sexiest fragrances a woman can wear. Yeah, wear this ladies... unless you might want to have an intelligent conversation with your date or significant other. Highly recommended. \nRating: 9.5/10", "4": "Confession: I\u2019m of the age where \u201cmature\u201d fragrances are not only appropriate but preferred.

YSL single handedly saved 2020 with this fragrance. This is seriously the best smelling concoction for both men and women.

The performance lasts all day and everyone will give you compliments. Well done YSL.", "6": "I love it. For me it\u2019s mostly boozy vanilla, lavender and orange blossom. It\u2018s a rather warm scent with the ambergris and tonka in the background. It\u2019s also a tad bit masculine, not a super girly scent. fall/cooler weather vibes for sure, not suited for summer in my opinion.", "7": "1. STOP comparing this to Mon Guerlain. They share few same notes does not mean that they smell similar.\n2. I am shocked at some people who say Libre Intense is not sweet.. IT definitely IS. The vanilla is the familiar/ similar type to Cinema and Manifesto.\n3. This perfume is warmer and deeper compared to Libre, but it does NOT perform powerhouse sillage.\n4. It has become my dumb reach perfume. Mass appealing for sure and is for colder weather. I really love how its gourmand warmth blends well with masculinity/ dryness/ sharpness of lavender, tonka bean, and vetiver.\n5. I feel more empowered and confident wearing this, though I doubt I would want my boss to smell like this (it does not give me that boss lady vibe, IMO).\n6. Neither a groundbreaking nor a masterpiece, but I always reach out to and just love it :-)", "8": "The sated, rumpled daze of the morning after\u2014lavender soap and smudged eyeliner, a cashmere sweater pulled over black lace-trimmed lingerie, maple French toast and vanilla coffee from room service, late check-out, autumn sun, one last almost-shy kiss.", "9": "The autumn witch brews a magical potion...\nIn it she fills: orange and mandarin juice, sun-dried lavender, three drops of dark honey, silky orchidblossoms and some tonka and spice, a dash of seasalt. \nBut thats not all, of course: With a smile, she adds a handful of sunset light and a good amount of the warmth of the midwinterfire...and a bit of the winternights darkness.  \nAh, what should I say? It is so good - feminine and masculine, old and young, cold and warm all at once. Would tend to call this an evening scent, but it is so relaxing at the same time, I would like to wear it, cuddled in a warm blanket, reading a book, safe inside my room, whilst the wind blows cold outside ;).", "10": "Wow...just spritzed this on at Sephora -- walked around for about 2 minutes and flagged down the SA to get me a bottle of this beauty!  I was never impressed with the original.  But this.....OMG, just gorgeous!!  \nYes it deserves all the hype!  :)\n\nHappy Saturday everyone!", "11": "Classy, classy, classy!\n\nOh wow, I wasn't expecting to love this as much as I do. Maybe I'm finally growing out of my sweetie bomb phase? (Eh, who am I kidding? I'm still lusting after a full bottle of Love by Killian.)\n\nThis is the most delicious vanilla I've smelled in a perfume for quite a while. It's smooth, inviting and ever so slightly sweet while the lavender keeps it from being cloying. The citrus notes remind me a little of Signature by Mont Blanc. I'd say this one is sexier and slightly edgier while Mont Blanc is like a comforting cuddle in a bottle. \n\nI can imagine a successful woman owning this perfume. Slightly messy bun, tight pencil skirt and skyscraper heels, but she's approachable and friendly as well. Like, she'll tell you what to do but she also brings homemade cookies in for birthdays. \n\nI want a full bottle now. Delicious stuff!\n\nEdit: I got a bottle for Christmas and this perfume is so gorgeous. It makes me feel like I could conquer the world.", "12": "My eyeballs probably went into the back of my skull first time I smelled this after I opened my brand new box of this deliciousness goddess amber colored juice.", "13": "I pretty much don\u2019t get the hype of the OG Libre. It seriously smelled like l\u2019occitane\u2019s almond line mixed with men\u2019s cologne.. but this one I LOVEEEE \n\nFor a second, the sweetness in this smelled like alien fusion. But after that wow.. stunning. Sweet, dense, creamy vanilla and amber that has lavender as its backbone. It has that men\u2019s cologne vibe that i usually don\u2019t really like, but in this it actually works for me. Elegant, sexy, and it projects attitude \ud83d\ude02\n\nThis might be too cloying under hot climates, but it\u2019s a gem for the cooler weather. Definitely the sexiest perfume in my collection. Mediocre projection, amazing longevity.\n\nEdit: i sprayed a little on my bedsheets and omg its drydown smells so peachy \ud83c\udf51 that\u2019s so weird because there isn\u2019t a peach note listed..", "14": "OK I\u2019m going to do a comparison from the original to the intense because that\u2019s what I look for. \n\nThe original Libre:\n\n This is definitely your summer sent. It is very airy and almost clean smelling with a hint of a masculine vibe. For those who think that this is feminine I completely disagree. This is a clean with a hint of musk. This is not sweet whatsoever. For those of you who love your sweet gourmands you will not like this. \nPros to this is the scent is very unique. I truly don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever smelt anything remotely like this. This is very inoffensive and honestly could be worn by a male or female. Cons is it\u2019s on the lighter side and can come across laundry scent ish. \n\nLibre intense: \n\nThis is definitely for you sweet lovers. It is really tonka/vanilla heavy. This is also very strong and has heavy projection. A couple sprays of this will go a very long way. \nThis smells very similar to M\u00fcggler Alien Essence Absolu and Jean Paul Gaultier Classique Essence de Parfum. Very orange blossom, Tonka bean, vanilla scent. \nPros to this is this is very likeable and mass appealing. I can\u2019t really picture many people not liking the scent. Cons it is a scent you have smelled before and isn\u2019t unique.\n\nBoth of these are very different so you can very much own both and justify it. \n\nI prefer the original just due to the unique quality of it. \n\n\n8/10 scents", "15": "I can\u2019t understand how it is similar to Alien Essence Absolue. Of course not, this is very clean, elegant and sweet with the lavender and orchids make it super interesting. I love it so much. I think it\u2019s also a bit soapy but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s similar to the original Libre by any means.. i think this perfume by far is the most beautiful perfume in 2020.

As for Libre Intense.. I feel SO f****** hot when I wear this. This is the ultimate hot girl/BAD girl fragrance. She's sensual and sexy as hell but could also kick your ass. The first time I smelled this I didn't know what to think because initially it's really aggressive. But as it dries down it becomes the most beautiful vanilla /lavender EVER. Don't get me wrong though, intense is still slightly unisex. But it leans more fem. After wearing it a few times I now consider Intense a lifer. \n\nAlso a good tip, if you layer it with a basic vanilla it makes it that much more amazing.", "17": "I love this scent. It reminds me of a delicious sweet cologne. Definitely a bit of a masculine vibe but somehow feminine at the same time and that is what makes it so sexy. It\u2019s a boss bxtch fragrance. I feel so confident when I wear it. However, she is a heavy hitter. Two hitter quitter. Anything more than two sprays and you\u2019ll die. Im not kidding. It\u2019ll take you out. I sprayed four sprays the first time and yeah, no. I couldn\u2019t get away from myself after desperately trying. \n\nMen love this scent. Many compliments every day. I had a young man come up to me and say \u201cYou smell so good. What are you wearing? I want to buy it for my girlfriend. I like it that much\u201d.\n\nProjection and silage are phenomenal. Beast mode.", "18": "This perfume have a vibe of Sassy Classy Girl Boss. Libre Intense is Vanilla Sweet but not sweet gourmand type. Is not a sickening sweet type but a Pleasant Comforting Sweet, even though it is a very strong perfume. The Lavender here is not your typical lavender that usually smells very androgynous or like a man's scent but It actually very feminine,  the lavender compliments the vanilla and tonka beans really well.\nIt is not a childish Vanilla perfume. But it is an adult sweet scent without making you smell like an old lady. So all I can say is you can be 25+ 30+ 40+ but feel young. \nJust a perfect vanilla for an adult. It also smells professional and artsy at the same time. You gonna make lots of people focus on you and mesmerize by your scent. Scents come first before your looks.\nAnd well please just look at the bottle,  dont you wanna put it in your vanity right now?", "19": "I tested this at a department store counter yesterday, along with the original Libre, and a Petit Robe Noir flanker along with a couple of others that were have been wiped from my mind Men in Black style...perhaps when I lifted and paused to admire the very stylish bottle of Libre Intense? \nI had just purchased a bottle of Alien so was purely window shopping on my way out. Oh dear, how naive!  You are shaking your head knowingly i'm sure.\nI went for lunch and my goodness, the fragrance from one spray on the top of my wrist was driving me crazy! Is that me?  It's vanilla...but herbal-ish? Is it sweet, no, yes, maybe? It's too masculine for me...oh no it isn't! And so on.  \nIt reminds me of something familiar, tucked way back in my olfactory memories, perhaps the slightest hint of something I wore in the 90's in my teens?   But this is better, so much better because I never would have forgotten something like this.\n\nIf I give an impression of chaos then I'm doing this fragrance a disservice.  It's smooth and assured, no screeching or cloying notes that I found, but unlike anything currently front and centre on the sparkling counters.  I don't want to be 'that' reviewer, but so many smell alike to me,  or should I say on me, and the performance is too often just blah. I have the wrong skin chemistry for them to shine.\nThis took me back to a time when fragrance made a statement. I was confused as it's not what I expected.  It's not overpowering, but it's not shy either. It's (so far) very different to the sweet and fruity abundance on offer.  It's in no way 'dated' or 'old fashioned' (or as I like to say, cool) and I think it has the potential to become a classic. \n\nIn terms of longevity I could smell it hours later, right until I washed it off. By then it was a deliciously creamy skin scent. What a beautiful fade out. The finale is just gorgeous mellow perfection.\n\nI had a sudden hot flash of worry before I went to bed last night.  I only bought 50ml...what if it's reformulated and made weaker? I'd better buy a 90ml to be sure...preferably from the same batch...just in case of an anomaly....would going back tomorrow be too weird?\nCan you tell I grew up with projection and sillage and still pine for it?  10/10 for me. Definitely, definitely try before you buy.", "20": "It keeps the nice orange flower of the original with the lavender note a bit sweeter and everything more amped up and deepened. Also the more plastic note of the original is gone into a nice amber base. Well done, for me it\u2019s a yes and will wear it with pleasure for the rest of the autumn. It\u2019s cozy yet sparkling due to the orange flower and for a mainstream release it turns the page from the fruity patchouli raspberry trend, I hope for good.", "21": "A perfume that makes a statement. It is for someone who is not afraid to be the center of attention. It is almost impossible to stay unnoticed. With that being said, keep in my mind one thing. You have to be able to pull it off. Otherwise Libre Intense will wear you, not the other way around.\n\nThe initial spray is warm, a bit spicy, and sweet. You are met with some vanilla, orange blossom, citrus, and a hint of lavender. That sounds lovely, doesn\u2019t it? Well, the best part is still ahead. Once more lavender, jasmine, orchid, and tonka beans step into the game, I lose my mind even more. In the dry down, Libre Intense is even better. Trust me, your arm will ache (at least my does) from many times you bring it up to your nose to get more of Libre Intense. Wow! I am lost for words. You simply must experience this perfume yourself.\n\nI see why the dry down might come off a bit masculine to some people. Yes, it is not stereotypically feminine, not something you expect. And that is the beauty of Libre Intense. It is probably the first perfume I can equally enjoy on both, women and men.\n\nLibre EDP is great, but to me, it lacks depth and character. Intense, however, is exactly what I imagined the original EDP to be. Elegant, dark, rich, special, and daring.\n\nThank you YSL for such a masterpiece! I can\u2019t get enough.", "22": "This really is a beautiful and unique fragrance.  Such a refreshing option in the sea of super sweet boring fragrances of today.  Harkens to the powerhouses of the 90s and earlier, when a bold statement was almost the singular purpose of a perfume.\n\nThis is bold, strong, powerful.  The dry down is literally to die for, deep, rich vanilla warmth while remaining clean.\n\nAlthough I really like Libre Intense, I wouldn\u2019t say it is an easy to wear perfume.  The opening is sharp, and people around you can find it overwhelming and harsh.  I honestly think this one needs a good 2/2.5 hours to reach its mid, and that is where the beauty really shines.  My 16 year old son calls this \u201cpoison\u201d and my husband isn\u2019t much of a fan either.  I suspect it over takes the house after I\u2019ve applied 2-3 sprays.  I absolutely think you\u2019ll want to apply it an hour before you leave the house so you don\u2019t overwhelm anyone out in the world\ud83d\ude05  I did get a headache the first time I wore this.  It can absolutely be cloying and suffocating.  So go easy on the trigger 2/3 sprays is PLENTY.  Maybe even one spray if you work in close proximity to others.\n\nThe lavender comes out sharp and definitely leans traditionally masculine in the opening.  The opening and first hour or two is what really makes this fragrance challenging to wear.  But once it starts to soften up it is truly a stunner.  It would be an amazing choice for an elegant night out, or a romantic evening.  Just give it time to marinate before you take it out on the town!\n\nThe dry down is everything you could want from a fragrance.  I really like this one.  But I disagree with those saying it is easy to wear or a safe blind buy.  Definitely test before splurging on a full bottle.", "23": "I realllyyyyyy risked it blind buying this fragrance particularly because of the lavender note. I am not a lover of any sort of lavender. My mum used to use it all the time when I was younger on my pillow at night I absolutely hated the smell. It is why I stayed away from the original Libre. BUT I am so so so so happy I got this, I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Since this had more vanilla there was a chance I would like this one more and I am so glad I did. One of the only fragrances that literally lasts an entire day on my skin and people can still smell it on me at night. I cannot stop wearing this. Sexy, warm and cosy, confident, boss lady all in one.", "24": "I\u2019m honestly surprised at some of these reviews, I find this to be completely lovely and wearable as heck. I am a fan of lavender and citrus notes, and I love the original, but this one really took me by surprise. The vanilla and tonka elevate this scent to a whole other level and I\u2019m here for it. While the original gives sophistication and class, this does the same while adding a \u201cyes, I\u2019m delicious\u201d element to it. If the younger crowd find the original to be too mature, I imagine this one would be more up their alley. Longevity and sillage are on par with the original, this scent performs extremely well. This fragrance does best in cold weather and/or at night.", "25": "00:00 - Fruity alcohol. Ugh. There's goes another $100 spent on the same scent that's everywhere.\n05:00 - Waitaminute! What is this? I think I love it! Behind the orangey fruit there's something addictive I can't stop sniffing. It's all of the other notes combined, yet none of them specifically. It's deep, sensuous, clean, dirty, spicy, sweet and amazing! \n10:00 - Oh yes, I love it. It's very 90's / 00's. I'll be wearing this all fall and winter. It's bold. \n\nSix hours later and I've gotten out of bed to go to the cabinet and smell anise. The dry down smells very much like anise. \n\nSo far everyone I had smell it loved it. \n\nVery androgynous. \n\nI'm all about this. The name, the bottle, the scent. \n\nSillage and longevity are both amazing.", "26": "It took me about four wears before I fell in love with the original Libre. First and second time I kind of hated it lol.. But I had gotten so many free samples of it, I kept trying it and slowly grew to love it. (To be very honest I kind of WANTED to love it because of the goddamn bottle as well haha).\nWhat made me fall in love with the original was the dry down. This intense version is the dry down of the original, but with amplified vanilla/tonka. This is definitely a Libre flanker though, as it is very similar to the original. \n\nI go for gourmands most of the time as they still are the easiest to please my nose, especially for a quick grab or comfort, so I got very excited when I saw they announced Libre Intense! I anticipated it to be just that, more intense, which often includes \"deeper\" and sweeter aspects. This one is truly just that. A deeper, sweeter and more intense version of the original. If you don't like or happen to be tired of sweet and if the \" fresh masculine edge\" is what drew you to the original, you might not like this one :) \nNothing to complain about with regards to lasting power or silage. \nI think this one is quite corporate sexy. Modern and slightly demanding. But at the same time it's quite easily wearable and comforting to snuggle up in (if you spray much less heh)\n\nJust as with Mon Guerlain, I like the intense version just a tad bit more. The intense versions of both were love at first sniff, the originals had to grow on me. But now I enjoy them all. This is less original than the original though. Pun intended..", "27": "This perfume is honestly love at first sniff for me. \nThe intense version of the Libre is definitely warmer and sexier. The amber and extra vanilla is what is missing from the original one, for me. You still very much get that white floral, lavender in this, but I think what makes this is the citrus has decreased and the extra vanilla and added amber element. The original is a little too much floral for me, to which it was slightly headache inducing, but this intense takes that away and dulls the masculinity with the vanilla and sweetness. This isn\u2019t too sweet, it\u2019s honestly the perfect balance. It\u2019s sophisticated and really just a chefs kiss.", "28": "I get orange blossom, with lavender and vanilla. It\u2019s just beautiful, deep, boss, sexy & mature scent. Basically if you wear this, you have your \u2018ish\u2019 together. The orange blossom settles down on the dry down & I get the Jasmine & becomes the sweet. \n\nThe OG- Libre is more masculine than the Libre Intense. Libre - Intense is suitable for a cooler weather or nighttime. The OG-Libre is lighter version of \u2018Libre Intense\u2019 \n\nLongevity is amazing, lasts until next day. 12++ hours \nProjection amazing. \n\n10/10", "29": "First time reviewing a fragrance with one that's under the Christmas' Tree!\nSo... When I first testes this, I was trying to compare it to the Original one. Love both and find them really similar.\nHowever this lasted for days on my skin. You read correctly. DAYS.\nI showered, twice or three times and still could smell the fragrance on my wrist. Of course I have to try it more often, on the daily, but that impressed me.\nOther than that, it's a sweet, intense fragrance but sexy. Want to use it ASAP.", "30": "This perfume is beautiful. It is a lavender vanilla, and its projection and lasting power is very strong. I consider it more of a night out fragrance since its stronger than the original, but I prefer it as it has a few more notes in it. If you like warm, creamy vanilla with a hint of caramel then you will love this scent!", "31": "I have Libre EDP and adore it, but I felt like it lacks a solid, grounded base. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I love it. \nThen, I blind bought this. Upon my initial sniff, my eyes rolled back and I had found a new love. Oh my dear God, how I love this. Heavy (but not weighty) overdose of vanilla that I find delectable and so satisfying when you - no-kidding - crave vanilla now!\nThe lavender is prominent and herbaceous. If you like these two notes, as I personally do, you will probably love this. \nWhen I need warmth and comfort, this is my go-to. It\u2019s a warm blanket that shields me from the bitter cold of winter (i.e. me now \ud83d\ude02.) Soothing and easy without compromising performance. More bang for your buck, given its performance. I can\u2019t get enough. Big love.\n\u2014-\nEdit: I love EDP too, and got a bottle. I guess I don\u2019t neeeeed both, but I like the profile and they\u2019re different for different seasons.", "32": "I don't know why but this smells a lot like Alien Absolue to me, but softer and much easier to wear. This leans unisex but anyone would have to have a bit of confidence to wear this as you will stand out with this on. It's also a bit strong so spray lightly. A big improvement over the original, as it's more distinctive and seems to be better made with better ingredients. I don't need this, but I kind of want it, so that's proof that this has something a bit special about it. Everyone should at least give this a serious try...its bound to evoke some kind of reaction from you.", "33": "You know when you have this sudden intense terrible feeling, making you shiver and wonder what is happening to you because you shouldn\u2019t obviously love something (or someone !) that much? This is not reasonable, but.\nThis is me today wearing Libre Intense. I\u2019ve lost my brain and I am completely enamored. The ambiguity of the lavender, the semisweet vanilla, the uncertain purple powder, velvety yet bold \u2026 yes, I want more than my 2ml sample. What a discovery. You wouldn\u2019t have guessed.", "34": "I have this one and the original. \n\nThe Comparison: This one is much sweeter, bordering gourmand territory. Not quite a full on gourmand in it's entirety. The Libre EDP OG is a brighter fresher version, focusing mainly on the lavender for me. I could see the Libre EDP OG as the day or Spring/Summer fragrance, and Libre Intense EDP as the night or Fall/Winter fragrance. They both seem to be appropriate for day/night to me, but I think the seasons matter most with these two if you had/desire to have both. I kind of see these two as being separate poles of the same fragrance. The Libre EDP seems like it's the top half of this pyramid, and the Libre Intense EDP is like the bottom half of this pyramid. Two sides of the same coin. I can smell the similarities in their DNA and overall composition, just one is literally the \"light\", and the other being the \"dark\". I find that lovely, and creative in how they did that, even if not intentional.\n\nLibre Intense: Very vanilla. Vanilla BOMB I'll say. This tonka-truck is a trickster in how it masquerades as a separate variety of vanilla. However, it doesn't drown out the other roles of the other notes. It's definitely very sweet, and the vanilla is of the extract variety on me, slightly boozy - bourbon, rum, a sweet boozy vanilla extract. I get a little jasmine, a little orange blossom, a little vetiver, a pinch of the ambergris, but what I really love about it is how it's the perfect balance of lavender/vanilla that keeps it on that line between aromatic floral, and sweet boozy vanilla. The longevity and sillage is incredible, a feat on my fragrance eating skin. This does for me what I wish Mon Guerlain had done for me. They do smell very similar and I tested them together on separate patches of skin. The dry down is identical on me, and I even get what does smell like licorice with Libre, wich I thought I would miss (in MG) because I love the mix of licorice, lavender, and vanilla. MG just didn't last longer than 30 minutes on me, and this was recommended to me as a solution. I am very impressed. All those little things I wish had been just a liiiiitttle bit different in MG, this does for me. More vanilla, more lavender, mild licorice mimicking notes somewhere, boozy, and much more unisex in my opinion. It smells incredible on my husband as well. This was just what I was hoping for and I already bought a back up bottle. \n\nI do prefer this one to the OG Libre. Abyss-like depth, smells like vintage done modern in a good way.", "35": "Definitely a wow one. I wear this at work and get so many compliments. It stays on your clothes and skin with bomb a** sillage. So many compliments with this fragrance I love it so much. Definitely a blind buy to those who haven't gotten a chance to smell it. wont regret.", "36": "Delicious, long-lasting, radiating fragrance. Beautiful warm vanilla and orange are the strongest notes on my skin, smells so much more expensive than it is. One of my favorite scents ever.", "37": "I prefer this much more to the original. It is the better choice for lovers of concentrated vanilla. The tonka and vanilla are much more pronounced compared to the original which has a more prominent and sharp orange accord. Libre Intense is soothing and has a beautiful dry-down that is calm, soothing and indulgent. It is contrasted with a fresh ambergris that maintains the uplifting character of the original, despite the heavier notes. \nThe longevity and sillage are moderate but I'm happy to top it up. It's also a great scent for layering because it's such a versatile vanilla and lavender with such like-ability, I would love to see how this pairs with Hermes Voyage's aromatic cardamom and lemon. The scent is versatile and would suit a range of occasions but I would reach for it in the daytime. It has a Sunday afternoon vibe in being relaxing, uplifting and effortless. I would say its completely unisex to since it isn't particuarly sweet and veres towards being an aromatic fougere.", "38": "My goodness, there is a lot going on with this one, which is why it reminds people of so many different fragrances. To me it smells like someone mixed Guerlain Mon Paris, Cacharel Eden, Dior Hypnotic Poison and Elie Saab Girl of Now in a test tube and somehow blended them up to work very nicely together. I'm sure you could get to the Libre Intense smell using different fragrances too. Despite that, it works very nicely, and is a gourmand aromatic scent with throw to fill a room. I like it a lot: somehow it comes off as sexy and edgy, with a large dose of that popular syrupy floral thing that is so popular these days (Givenchy L'Interdit, I'm looking at you) paired with a 90s powerhouse floral vibe. Though it has lavender in it, it's much subtler in here even than in Mon Paris, and certainly more so than Chanel Jersey or Guerlain Jicky, say. If you're looking for a lavender scent, this isn't it. Much more prominent is baked Thanksgiving marshmallow. Dries down to be powdery (reminding me now of a rarity, Castelbajac). All of this makes for quite a cerebral experience. At once good humoured, knowing, and very sexy.", "39": "Ok.  This impressed me.  Here, I get Manifesto plus lavender.  It is gorgeous and lasts for 8-10 hours on my skin.  The projection is also amazing.  If you like the vanilla in Manifesto and Cinema, you'll like Libre Intense.    If Mon Guerlain and Manifest had a child.  I tried the regular Libre  but it was just too fresh for me.  The Intense is warmer and more resinous.  A must for me.", "40": "It is absolutely insane how good this is on my skin. I love the original Libre - I am a sucker for lavender in pretty much anything - but the sexy, heavy vanilla and floral notes in the dry down of this flanker are straight up intoxicating. I end up smelling myself at regular intervals throughout the day and sighing with pleasure, because the scent is transportive for me - I've spent a good bit of time in Provence, and this is the smell of Avignon and Aix, lavender fields and boulangeries and warm, golden sunshine that drips through leaded glass windows. It's also a powerhouse. You will know you are wearing it, and you WILL be noticed wearing it, so be forewarned: this may smell like a field of flowers, but it isn't a fragrance for wallflowers.", "41": "Beautiful sexy scent! The opening is very similar to the original Libre, aromatic and fresh with lots of white floral but this version becomes a lot warmer and sweeter, the dry down is mostly vanilla on me, a warm but dry vanilla that reminds me of YSL Manifesto's dry down. Since it's heavier, I think it's more suited for the evening but you can pull it off during the day in autumn and winter when it's cold outside, in summer it would be too heavy for me. Sillage and longevity are really good.", "42": "This is lovely. Gorgeous bottle, well-blended, smells expensive. I usually like candy, fluffy, or syrupy-sweet scents, but this is sweet in a slight, refined way. I barely smell the vanilla, but it adds such a nicer, warmer touch to the fragrance. I thought I would hate it because I am not a huge lavender person, but I was delightfully surprised by this and the original Libre. It makes me feel elegant. Just do not overspray during the summer! LOL It can choke someone out more easily than original Libre.", "43": "This one is a masterpeace ....lasts for hours on me its really rare that a perfume can last so long on me...its hot sweet flame summer wear thing , recommend for age 25+ its not mature but not girly also , really good, got a lot of compliments, honestly its not my favorite and not my signature scent but its a beast !!! Recommend", "44": "Okay, full disclosure, I have completely forgotten what the opening notes are like (also don\u2019t care lol) because omg..... can we discuss the drydown?! I sprayed this on my arm at 10AM. By 7PM, I was still happily jamming my nose into my arm to get a whiff. My eyes literally roll into the back of my head EVERY time I come back for a sniff. Libre Intense is SO warm, so sweet, so sexy, dark, delicious, powerfully feminine, intensely alluring, unapologetic, seductive.... I could go on and on and on.... it is just a superbly balanced perfume for when you want to feel like a confident, grown woman who is in command of herself (and the poor soul she is about to devour lol). I smell this, and I envision all of the black, expensive, skimpy, sexy, lacey lingerie I didn\u2019t think I needed until now. I don\u2019t find this scent particularly complex or complicated, but it tells a story. If Libre is a snack, Libre Intense is the whole meal, plus desert, a night cap, & whatever you eat the morning after.... :)\n\n\nEDIT: I thought it reminded me of Mon Guerlain until I smelled them side by side... not even close.", "45": "Wow! What a beautiful perfume! All the notes are blended beautifully, there is nothing that smells synthetic in it whatsoever. The original Libre was missing something and this version is just a complete, stunning scent. Orange blossom, vanilla, lavender and tonka are the most prominent notes. This is a expensive smelling perfume, perfume that says I am in charge, it will definitely boost your confidence. It's funny how people see this scent as perfect for a winter time... I completely don't get it? For me it's all year rounder! I love it!", "46": "This fragrance is one of the most beautifully constructed I\u2019ve ever experienced! A breathtaking symphony of the most perfectly-chosen notes ... beautiful, rich, comforting vanilla leads this masterpiece ... Complimented by light florals, Tonka bean, orange blossom, and a little lavender (in a Mon Guerlain sort of way). To me, it is perfection! It actually has great projection and longevity, with me, as well. Which, lately (maybe due to the fact I\u2019m not in my 20\u2019s anymore), is very rare. My skin devours most fragrances and almost everything sits very closely on me. \nIf you are very sensitive to sweet fragrances, you may not like it. It is sweet, but a sophisticated sweet.. perfectly so, for me. There is nothing offensive at all, in my opinion. \nIf you are a vanilla fan, it is a must have! \ud83d\udc95", "47": "I got this for christmas, and I couldn't be more happy!! At first spray, I was in love. The jasmine is very prominent to me, and the fragrance also has a soapy feel to it. I feel so confident wearing this, and it's the last finishing touch to my outfit I didn't know I needed until now. 12 hours has gone by since I sprayed it on, and I can still smell it even though I just took a shower. This is definitely one of the fragrances on my shelf that I'll be reaching for very often.", "48": "Everyone in my classroom smells and adores this scent whenever I wear it. I have both this and the regular version, and I can very much categorize this more for colder days. The regular version is a bit more bright and happy, the intense is sexy, warm and kind of daring. Easily a favorite of mine.", "49": "A YSL BANGER!!!\nYSL rarely pulls it off but this----------is very intoxicating... Sweet and delicious for a woman of class... Guys will enjoy this ladies so go get you one...\n\n8.1/10"}, "39": {"0": "Bought this a couple of months ago and it's now my main go-to-frag. Absolutely love it and 100% rebuying it once I'm done with my current bottle. \nProjection is great, longevity is great, scent is incredible, even the bottle is pretty, really - I can't say one subjectively negative thing about this? In a way I almost don't wanna post this review and possibly contribute to more people buying it; because I'd rather not see this become another 1 million/ADGP/Sauvage. So I'm ending with this one line to sort all the quick scanners out: \nSmells like horseshit.", "1": "I was at Macy's last night. I had went to sample Prada Lhomme. I went to the men's fragrance counter saw they had it in stock but no tester. Had testers for every fragrance except this one. The sales associate was very rude. So I decided to play a few games with her. I ended up purchasing this fragrance sprayed it on my hand and arm. And then proceeded to return it right back for a refund. And I told the sales associate that now she does have a tester. But it smells amazing will purchase it but not from Macy's ever.  \nScent 8/10\nLongevity: 8/10\nSillage 7/10\nCompliment factor : 10/10.", "2": "Sentence Summary: \nI hate to use the Goldilocks and 3 bears analogy, but with fragrance instead of porridge, but I'm bloody well going to do it:\nSo Goldilocks first smelled the Baby bear (who was wearing Infusion D'homme) and it was just a wee bit too powdery, she then had a sniff of Mummy bear (who was wearing Prada Amber Pour Homme) and it was just a wee bit too soapy. Finally she breathed in Daddy bears cologne (he was wearing Prada l'homme) and it was neither too powdery nor too soapy, in fact it was JUST RIGHT! \nThey were also all far easier to spray than the porridge. \nOverall Rating: 9/10", "3": "Gorgeous. This is a safe scent done right. It manages to be interesting enough without being generic or boring. It's a lovely flowery scent that manages to not be too flowery, or feminine. The pepper and cedar help keep it masculine. This isn't groundbreaking or anything, but it's still very good.  \nIt's hard to describe this one really. It's a very smooth, very creamy, slightly spicy flowery scent that is just very, very pleasing and comfortable. What really sets this apart is its ability to pull off a flower scent without being cloying or too flowery. It's just nice and subtle. This would make a very good formal scent. The opening is incredible, and the drydown is gorgeous. I don't find this to be too soapy, like some people are mentioning. Not on my skin anyway. There's definitely a cosmetic vibe to it, but it's still very warm and not cool. Not the soapy, generic letdown Dior Sauvage was for me. The Ambroxan smell of Dior Sauvage is overwhelming and boring to me, it's just a soapy Ambroxan bomb, while Prada's L'Homme has a much more toned down soapy vibe which lets the other notes shine and therefore allow it to have some dimension to it. Honestly, the more I wear this, the more I love it. It's probably one of the best floral-based I've smelled. I normally don't like florals for how overpowering and heady they are, but this one is lovely. A definite keeper.\nOh and just in case you weren't sure, women absolutely love this stuff. \nI'd definitely recommend it, but probably not at full price. >$100 is a bit much for this one in my opinion. If you can find it at $50-65, I'd pull the trigger. Don't blind buy this though. It may not be your cup of tea, or more accurately; your bouquet of flowers. \nHonestly guys this is such an odd fragrance to me. The fragrance feels very simple, but also very classy and complex at the same time. It feels cosmetic, and yet it's warm, inviting and still very interesting. It's flowery, but somehow not cloying or heavy. The barbershop is there, but it's a small, charming barbershop full of character in the middle of a spring meadow full of flowers, away from the city. It's just so.... lovely, is really the most accurate word I can think of for this one. It's lovely. And I absolutely love it. I will definitely have to check out the Intense version.  \nScent: 9/10\nLongevity:7/10\nSilage:7/10\nPersonal Appreciation: 9/10", "4": "Why ever single release is hated like it's the end of the world? \nWell, i've sniffed this one today, and I must say, as a lover os iris note this is fantastic!\nVery strong iris note, more fresh and \"clean\" then dior homme, not saying one it's better then the other, they're diferente fragrances.

Yes, they share some common notes and vibes, but it's a great niche fragrance on it's own - does not deserve to be listed in a row with tens of synthetic Ave-clones. It was my signature scent for a year and gosh, it's been noticed more than any other scent in my life. Complex, rich and great quality. One of the best frags ever made. In fact, I revere it more than Aventus.", "4": "I am obsessed with this fragrance after ordering a sample of it from MiN NY. It is very sweet with a background of subtle wood. Every time I smell it on me it gives me a rush of euphoria. I absolutely love that it smells so natural without any synthetic tones. There is a hint of spice and the feeling of a spring forest after a light rain, caressing the berry bushes and causing them to release a sweet aroma. I just ordered a full bottle. I can see that there is similarity to Aventus, but it is quite different and stands firmly as a unique fragrance. Very little smoke, and much more sweet. And I find that the sweet heart and drydown is what makes this more pleasurable for me than Aventus.", "5": "Before you buy you should understand that Mancera/Montale as a brand is a very unique house. They are by and large a direct to consumer brand and that designation is very important because they engineer their fragrances very differently than fragrances houses that sell in department stores. Designer brands are built to create an amazing opening because they know that you will base your purchasing decision on that opening spray; unfortunately, they break down fairly fast and often end up being simple smelling skin scents. Mancera fragrances are the complete opposite of this model\u2026they are thick and oily and are created to last hours and hours on your skin. The openings are weird and muted but once the oils open up they radiate at a low boil for an incredibly long time. Cedrat Boise is built very much the same. Strange opening, but about a half an hour later this is a great scent\u2026fruity and woodsy with a nice leather back drop. This people saying it\u2019s weak or doesn\u2019t project are either confused or have no sense of smell. This is a wear everywhere at anytime fragrance.", "6": "Like eating lemon-vanilla ice cream in a cedar bowl, at a forest picnic. \n\nAll the girls at work love this, I was surprised by all the comments. \"I love walking past your desk because you smell so great!\" \n\nIt does smell great... If your looking for compliments, I can't think of a better choice. People will love this. If thats what you want.\n\nI have no idea about the Aventus connection, I don't pay any attention to creed anymore lol.", "7": "Don't you just hate it that EVERY fragrance with one or two notes similar to Aventus gets compared to Aventus?\n\nThere is absolutely NO resemblance between CB and Aventus. Yes, they share a few notes, but these are two totally different fragrances. Mancera does not do clones. So, do us all a favor and stop comparing them.\n\nFor me this is a very pungent, in-your-face, synthetic mess. I cannot understand why people like this.", "8": "9.5 out of 10. An amazing fragrance to say the least! \n\nFrom gorgeous zesty citrus blackcurrant opening and a beautiful fruity evolving blackcurrant and mildly spicy heart (with a hint of vanilla coming in too at this stage) that lasts hours to the sensuous and breathtakingly sexy cedar-moss and musk dry down (again for many hours). Very tolerable an subtle sandalwood in the dry down too (even for those who hate this note) with a well balanced touch of leather to boot (pun not intended). An absolute blended masterpiece!\n\nScent - 10/10\nSillage - 9/10\nLongevity - 9/10\n\nAbout the similarities to Royal Vintage (R.V.) and Aventus (Av.) \n\nMore similar to the DNA of Av. but still similar to R.V. but I find C.B. more refined and youthful than the other two. Av. amazing handling of the pink pepper note (not in C.B) makes it more aromatic and gives it that slight push forward between the three.\n\nNo smokey ashy tones in Cedrat Boise though which is to everyone's individual taste. I like it more some days and less others.\n\nQuality ingredients from the three houses goes without saying but C.B. is one (literally tiny) step ahead being more balanced, blended and well rounded. Also I find I get more longevity with C.B. than the other two.\n\nIMO they are different scents yet reminiscent of each other. R.V. is closer in DNA with old batches of Av. and C.B. is closer to newer batches and therefore some of the Av. first knock offs like Lomani's AB Sprirt Silver and Reyane's Insurrection Pure II are closer to R.V. None of Av. knock offs smell to much like C.B to me.\n\nNOTE - Be careful with this fragrance it causes nose blindness very quickly and you can over apply it thinking it's not working. I did that and went to work with about 7-8 sprays all over and nearly everyone could smell it from across the whole room! A lady who hates any perfumes (she gets headaches) was at least 15 meters away from me when she complained. Everyone else loved it and told her to quiet down. One lady who works four cubicles down come right into my cubicle to tell me it was fantastic fragrance. I was utterly shocked cause I could smell nothing all morning! Total nose blindness. 2-3 sprays should be more than enough.", "9": "Smelled it hated it. Smelled it again scrubbed it off.  Smelled it again kind of liiiike it.   Smelling it now.  Amazing! Moral of the story give fragrances a chance cuz you never know", "10": "My very first impression when I first smelled it: Starts off nice and citrusy, but then dries into something very distinct. This smells like an AXE fragrance (not sure which one) if it was made with expensive ingredients. It takes me back to the middle school lunch room and bus rides homes. A very powerful memory.\n\nAfter wearing the fragrance and getting more familiar with it: There is no shortage of scents in the 'fruity-woody' genre but this is one of the best I have come across. The citrus notes hang around much longer than usual without screaming synthetic screechiness, but the heart and soul of this fragrance is a rich blackcurrant note on a woody vanilla background. The leather and patchouli contribute a dry smokiness which helps to restrain the sweet fruits and vanilla from dragging the fragrance beyond the danger signs and into gourmand territory.\n\nI have read a few comments comparing this fragrance to the divisive but successful Aventus by Creed and I agree that there are definite similarities. In fact it immediately reminded me of Aventus when I first sprayed it. It shares a bundle of notes - blackcurrant, vanilla, leather, patchouli, bergamot, jasmine, musk and moss - so this should come as no surprise. The main differences are the absence of pineapple (Royal or otherwise), less smokiness and stronger blackcurrant and vanilla notes (well, those are the main differences from my 2011 batch anyway). The heightened sweetness confers a more unisex impression, to my nose.\n\nLongevity is excellent; 10 hours from 4 sprays. Sillage is better than average. The bottle and packaging are first class.\n\nPros: It may remind you of Aventus\"\nCons: It may remind you of Aventus\"", "11": "I have never left a review on here BUT I felt the need to log in and leave one specifically in response to people saying this fragrance does not have good longevity. Anyone saying this absolutely must be going anosmic to it after a few hours. This fragrance has absolutely beast mode longevity and above average projection, and I have a newer batch. In fact, the ONLY issue I have with this one is the fact that it\u2019s hard to wash off in the shower and I don\u2019t normally like when a fragrance has that attribute. If it were not for that I would wear it much more because it smells wonderfully intoxicating. Imagine a smoother, creamier and slightly sweeter Aventus. Not to say it smells like it, because it is an entirely different scent, but it\u2019s done in a similar style. Love this one, definitely recommend a purchase.", "12": "Top and mid notes do resemble Aventus and it is easy to see why there are so many reviews comparing these two great fragrances.

It seems to me that Mancera  Fragrances need to mature or macerate for a while before they get their true strength. I have Cedrta Boise EDP and Intense Cedrat Boise and my EDP  is running laps around the Intense right now. I have had the EDP for about 8 months and it is a beast now. The same scenario goes for Instant Crush. When I first got it, the performance was lack luster but now it is beastly.

The opening is fresh, inviting, versatile, and very pleasant. The lemon, bergamot, fruity, and black currant are the opening most noticeable notes. The fruity notes come across as sweet pineapple, the lemon and bergamot enhance and sharpen this note with a noticeable citrus touch. The black currant has a berry, fruity, tangy, green, slightly ammoniac accord, it works well sharpening the opening notes. The fragrance has a noticeable smoky accord similar to birch. The cedar, and spices, create the next line of notes with fresh woody and spicy touch. The spices don\u2019t have a defining characteristic, they come across as just multiple spices. The leather and moss are projecting notes, the leather is tone-down, a refined leather far from animalic or pungent and it contributes mostly as a projecting accord. Similarly, the moss adds a light earthy, and bitter touch. The rest of the notes provide support, a patchouli adds a fresh green touch, the jasmine is a faint white floral touch, the sandalwood and vanilla, are a sweet touch. The fragrance is relatively linear, the citruses are more noticeable during the opening, bright, and sharp, however, they calm down a bit once they reach the dry down, also, the smoky accord grows towards the dry down along with the rest of the notes although no note goes to any significant transformation. Once Mancera Cedrat Boise EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, mildly sweet, lemon, bergamot, pineapple, smoky, and woody fragrance with green and spicy notes. The fragrance feels casual, common, delectable, elegant, fresh, fruity, gentle, slightly green, high-quality, intense, inviting, masculine, modern, mossy, nicely-blended, playful, sharp, smoky, sour, sparkly, sporty, slightly sweet, versatile, woody, zesty, and pleasant.\n\nBATCH REVIEWED: 2020 (#20A2138).\nWOW RATING: 10/10.

Beautiful. Sweet. Loud. Boisterous.  These are some compliments that can be used for this Pierre Montale modern chypre masterpiece that is the most popular men's Niche these days next to Aventus. The reason why both these fragrances ( and they are both very different by the way) work is because they have a bit of everything for everyone and do not fall in one category. In the case of Cedrat Boise one would expect a clean woods but that is not the case. There are so many others like bergamot, lemon, black currant, jasmine, patchouli, sandalwood, leather, moss, musk and vanilla blended in so expertly around that central cedar note that it becomes almost completely indistinguishable in the blend. Warm and bright and very loud this is not for understated elegance occasions and needs a certain brashness to carry off. Very strong on sillage and projection. This one is a very happy and bombastic experience to wear. Enjoy!", "24": "For me, it's the sandalwood and jasmine notes that star after the initial, very pleasant citrus opening. I get very good performance from this and it's the type of scent i look forward to wearing when the occasion and mood suits.\nAfter several wears of this, it is definitely a keeper in my collection and if it was a choice between a bottle of this or a bottle of Aventus, it's this.", "25": "I have a 2019 batch. I have no clue what anyone is talking about when it comes to this fragrances performance. This fragrance has lasted on my skin for 10 hrs plus. Projected for a very solid 3.5 - 4 hours. But guess what after an hour I can not smell it myself. You know why? Because I have gone nose blind to it. This scent is one of the easiest fragrances to go nose blind to for me. Don't ask me why, but it is. I do not think a fragrance that lasts on skin for 10 hrs plus is going to become a skin scent within an hour or two. Just doesn't seem possible to me... I also highly doubt there are batch variations all over the place. It's possible but I doubt it. That's all I'm saying. Yeah it might not last as long as the original batches. But I still get great performance and longevity out of this fragrance.", "26": "Musky tart fruity pebbles with a touch of vanilla is the best way to describe Mancera Boise. Excellent projection and extremely versatile. Really great stuff friends!\n\nPS: Does not smell like Creed Aventus", "27": "Mancera cedrat boise and Mancera aoud lemon mint are my first niche fragrances and they both really suprised me. The opening of cedrat boise is nice but the drydown is amazing and delicious. I get a woody fruitiness from it and the fruit that comes to my mind when i smell it is pineapple, but not a normal pineapple, its a pineapple that is being grilled on the barbeque. \n\nThe potency of Cedrat boise is amazing, I slept with it sprayed on my arm and tossed and turned with my arms under the sheets all night and it is still very present on my arm after 10 hours.\n\n My closing statement is i have many designer fragrances and i do love most of them but Mancera cedrat boise and aoud lemon mint are readily available for under 90 usd and they both totally destroy 95% of designer fragrances in terms of quality and performance.\n\nCedrat Boise is a 10/10 fragrance", "28": "The longer you wear Cedrat Boise, the more you can appreciate it. I wasn't too impressed when I first wear it. But give it time, then you will treasure the warm woody vibe in the dry down. The opening can be a little bit juvenile with its blackcurrant blast, but I like it. And it's quickly transformed into a more serious and mature woody scent. Did I mention the great staying power too? I sprayed like 4 to 6 times in the morning, and it will stay for the whole day. So it's a good value for money. And it's unique, not many people wear this scent. That's why I chose this as my signature scent for now.", "29": "i bought this fragrance now 4 days ago, and all can i say...i love it, handsome smells with outstanding performance\n14 hours on my skin with enormous sillage in the first 4-5 hours. very good price for this fragrance ( 95 usd- 89 euros on online retailer).\nI don't care about bad reviews of aventus fans- i jost love this fragrance !", "30": "I\u2019m gonna play devils advocate here because seriously the reviews and \u201csmells like\u201d section here lately are driving me crazy. I understand fragrance is subjective, but when thousands of people claim a fragrance smells like something when it barely resembles it, drives me insane. Just because the fragrances share similar notes doesn\u2019t mean they are gonna be closely related. This smells nothing like Aventus. If you compare them side by side they\u2019re two totally different fragrances that share a few notes in common and that\u2019s it. The fragrances may be in the same realm in terms of style but it would not be redundant to own Cedrat Boise and Aventus in your collection. \n\nTo my nose, Cedrat Boise by Mancera is a great fragrance and one I didn\u2019t have high hopes for because I\u2019ve hated almost everything from Montale  that I\u2019ve smelled. I was worried Mancera being the sister company I\u2019d be underwhelmed like with Montale. However, in CB you get a bright, versatile, complex fragrance that can be worn in many occasions. It\u2019s got a bright fruity citrus opening backed by soft woods and then dries down to a nice fresh aromatic spicy woody fragrance. I actually really enjoy it! \n\nThe dry down for me has a really nice \u201cfizziness\u201d that I can almost describe as the smell of ginger beer or candied ginger. Backed by cedar, spices, and patchouli. Honestly I love this fragrance and I can see myself wearing this throughout the year. It\u2019s especially good for my region here in South Florida as we have summer weather almost year round. \n\nThis is full bottle worthy for me and I definitely get the projection and performance on this. Glad I got a chance to get a sample of this because I wouldn\u2019t have considered it based on my thoughts of Montale. I actually get a slight similarity to Histoires de Parfums 1828 but woodier and deeper.", "31": "I really like this smell. Is had a Fresh Citrusy Woody vibe and great lasting power (!!) on my skin. I don't know if I should buy this one... but I wouldn't bother if it was given for surprise. I follow those who say it has an unpleasant or harshe note. I'm 99% sure that the Black Currant bothers so many people. But I'm fine with it until now.\n\nAlso this is \"like that one creed\".... for about 20 seconds people!!! Please stop making those comparisons. After one or two minutes it settles on the skin really beautiful and develops like crazy. I can't smell that dominant Pineapple from that one particular Creed in this one.  If people only buy frags just to compare them with other (niche) fragrances, we would be all for from home.\n\n(* EDIT ONE) : For those who still think this is like \"that one creed\" : Cedrat Boise projects and you will notice it on your own skin. Not like that Creed one where your silage is captivating most people (or an even an entire room) except your own nose  (I suffer severe \"Nose Blindness of it\", which is the only thing I really hate about \"that one\")\n\n(* EDIT TWO) : Just bought it. Would even sell 20 bottles if I had to. This is true art.\n\nBtw, if you like Aventus , well good for you, we all like that one.\nIf you like Cedrat Boise well, you're not alone... Really... this one is a true Masculine (but gentlemen's) masterpiece.\n\n10/10 hands down", "32": "This frag is why it pays to read up on fragrances; because for me the smokiness of Aventus makes it too much of an old man scent, and CB performs on the same level in the areas of sillage and longevity yet it costs a fraction of Aventus' price. My personal advice is \"just buy it\". Also, I got a compliment first day I wore it and I expect more to come", "33": "Just blind bought this and it came in today.  Can say with 100% confidence, that this is a SAFE blind buy!\n\nNow to spare you the lengthy comment and get down to bare bones. How GIT is Chez Bond, Aventus is to this.\n\nClose, but there are some nuances you can easily pick out. For example I get more leather, less smoke, a just a little more sweetness out of this one. I wouldn't call it an alternative, but a great frag all it's own.", "34": "Cedrat Boise by Mancera Review\n\nI just picked this one up three weeks ago. It's been the only fragrance I've felt like wearing since. \n\nCedrat opens up with a nice lemon note. The lemon quickly leads into the black currant which is dominant throughout. The fruity opening leads into a powdery vanilla, cedar, and musk combination for the remainder of the wearing. This is a wonderfully rich smell. Overall the fragrance is fairly linear. This can smell a little sour if you smell it too close to the skin. This one shines from a distance.\n\nThis scent gets a lot of comparisons to Creed Aventus. This is both good and bad. It's good because it's gotten a lot of people to sample this one. On the flip side, you may be disappointed if you go in with the wrong expectations. The opening VERY BRIEFLY reminds me of Aventus. It also has a similar vibe. That being said, this is definitely NOT an Aventus clone! This does not have the smokiness that Aventus is known for. Sample and appreciate both fragrances for the unique creations they are! Both would be great additions to any collection.\n\nThe performance on this one is excellent. I use 1 spray for work and 2 sprays for everything else. It's incredibly versatile. I can see this being worn for any occasion or season. Be careful on the sprays though. This one is deceptively strong at times.\n\n\nBest Age Group- 25+\nBest Season(s)- Fall/Spring/Summer/Winter\nOccasions- Formal, Dates, Casual, Work\nProjection/Sillage- Medium\nLongevity- 12 Hours\nSmell- 10/10\nOverall- 10/10\n\nYouTube Channel: theaveragecologneguy", "35": "Had to leave a review, after so many people are just frankly being unreasonable with this frag. In my opinion, it's lovely, fruity, woody, citrusy with a hint of creaminess.  My Favorite in my collection with YSL Caftan which is almost three times the price.  Performance is great and it's a compliment monster. Smells expensive, well blended, and better than most designers. Does it smell like Aventus? Well, kinda. To me, it's more fruity and creamy and less smoky than Aventus. Definitely similar but not a clone for sure. I'd say a much better allrounder and bigger compliment getter and also more versatile and youthful than Creed's pride. There are no negatives that I can think of. I have the screw-on cap bottle. For the price, it's a 10/10.", "36": "Long story short: a divine long lasting fragrance with a brutal projection (but not cloying at the same time). Fresh, fruity, sweet and leathery.\n\nTo all people searching for a cheap alternative to Aventus: This is not the way to go. While during the first 2 minutes some similarities may be noticed, Cedrat Bois stands on its own and develops in a totally different direction (I personally prefer Cedrat Bois).\n\nMy best blind buy so far.", "37": "Okay this is not a clone of Aventus but to say they smell nothing a like is nonsense. C'mon, the opening here is very similar to Aventus. It drys down in a different way though. Someone mentioned old he-man action figures. Yes! I get what you mean. It's almost a lotion like soft woods on the lightest of leathers, really nice. I get big projection in the first hour then settles to a nice scent bubble. This lasts on my skin easily for 8-10 hours.\nAnother reviewer mentioned layering this with armafs club de nuit intense and he was on to something! You end up with something waaaaaaaaaaay better than Aventus. So you can have a 100ml of each for roughly $140 and in total have 200ml of something that tops Aventus. \nHaters will hate but to me, myself and I and I,\nThat's the truth.\nPierre makes some out there stuff but he also makes some good shit at Fair prices. Bravo.", "38": "Opens like aventus then almost immediately transforms into this woody, resinous, fruity aroma. At first, I wasn't a big fan of the drydown. But then I took the time to understand this fragrance and It reminded me on standing in the middle of a PINE TREE forest and smelling the gold, sticky liquid that leaks from the trees. Wonderful.", "39": "A humid summer day in coastal southeast/east Asia. Touristy city. At least a decade or two ago. The season for baseball caps and Hawaiian shirts. Starting to sweat and eager to get out of the sun, you get in the back of a cab - it smells like the driver might smoke, but regardless he makes an effort to keep his vehicle fresh with cleaners and a lemony air freshener. Or something. \nOld black leather-ish seats with cracks over years of use. Some wood-like design near the side door handles that you can't tell are real - probably not. None of this bothers you of course.\n\nI greatly enjoyed this for invoking such a scene in my mind. The description might be off-putting but it was great and kind of nostalgic for me, in an old Hong Kong movie sort of way. The connection is strikingly vivid to me. I'd take it easy on the sprays. Personally it feels quite masculine but you do you. \ud83d\ude0e", "40": "On my skin Cedrat Boise is a 9.5/10 on scent, quality, sillage and longevity. It is super fruity at the opening and  makes this fragrance very inviting and delicious. After 1 hour this fragrance becomes woody but it maintains a good balance of the freshness and woodiness; again very friendly and just an amazing experience.\nAfter 4 hours, Cedrat B. has run out of black currant and at this point all that you are left with is an elegant cedar wood scent with a pinch of vanilla and musk which contributes to the sensual character of the fragrance.\nThe development of this fragrance is just amazing and you find yourself travelling through the various different levels of the scent. \n\nNow does it smell like a Aventus? Yes but not completely.I would say that in terms of price, sillage and longevity Cedrat B. is the better fragrance. \nIn terms on the scent produced i call this a tie, but it has to be an overall win for Cedrat B. due to the price.", "41": "Very surprised by this one. Quite an enjoyable fragrance. It's probably the first real fruity fragrance that I have smelled. It smells like luxury, and very natural\n\nThe woods and leather sit just behind the fruity scents, which just float on top. \n\nIt's a beautiful fragrance!", "42": "Excellent fragrance and I\u2019m in love with this one. Trying to make a choice for my signature this summer between Aventus , cedrat Boise and Sauvage. Have to say that this is a compliment monster. Boosts my confidence to a whole new level. Definitely different from Aventus but yes there are some similarities. Overall , a 9/10 fragrance. 1 point down as I believe this lasts averagely on my skin but for this price, it\u2019s hard to beat it.\n\n\nEdit :  This is now my signature for summer.

My absolute favorite notes when it comes to perfume reflect this: cozy, gourmand, boozy, smoky, spicy... I\u2019ve always been more drawn to mysterious & yummy autumn/winter scents\u2026 \nHowever, when I first encountered Bal d\u2019Afrique by chance at a Byredo counter in Amsterdam, my entire thinking around \u201csummer\u201d scents changed. Here was an unmistakably summery scent, with all the attributes I had once associated with autumn/winter scents! \nEvery one of my favorite perfumes has an accompanying song in my mind, and for Bal d\u2019Afrique, it\u2019s \u201cI Love Hot Nights\u201d by Jonathan Richman & The Modern Lovers. Whenever I wear this, I am instantly transported to Morocco, in a bustling outdoor night market, surrounded by stalls full of fruits, incense, and spices\u2026 the midday heat is still clinging to the evening air and I can feel the cool sheen of sweat on the nape of my neck\u2026 there\u2019s music, laughter, dancing, shop owners loudly beckoning passers-by\u2026 I feel the evening breeze caress my body upwards from under my summer dress... My head is spinning with colors and sounds and heat and magic\u2026 \n\u2026 I always get a little carried away describing how I experience Bal d\u2019Afrique. \nThere\u2019s a definite prominent pineapple note (surprised it isn\u2019t listed at all), but what truly brings it all together for me is vetiver base. This is, in my opinion, what separates Bal d\u2019Afrique from other fruity summer perfumes - it adds a mysterious earthy quality that makes you feel as through you\u2019re surrounded by something ancient and sacred\u2026 I don\u2019t know how exactly to explain it. I have both the full bottle and the roll-on, which is a summer handbag staple for me. Sillage is excellent, and it lasts all day on my skin. To this day, it\u2019s the only scent that can instantly make me yearn for July.", "3": "This is a beautiful everyday scent. To me it smells of lemons and milk. It evokes feelings of happiness and safety. Very soft but quite unique.", "4": "LOVE LOVE LOVE... This is the first perfume EVER (in the 40 years of my life and the probably 25 years I'm using perfumes), which I bought on the same day of smelling it for the first time... the first time ever that a recommendation of a shop assistant was spot on.... and the first time, a perfume became my signature scent straight away. I smelled it and it was just... me.  \nI was on a lunch break hunt for new scents and had a chat in the shop about my current favorites (normally fresh white flowers with a green touch, since recently also more woody and deeper/more masculine scents, but never too powdery, makes me cough)...\nThe assistant showed me Bal d'Afrique... I smelled it for the first time... and went \"Mmmmmh!\" immediately... not like oftentimes, when you politely answer \"Yes, nice...\" or \"Mhm, not bad...\" to those awful scents some of the shop assistants are recommending, with the words \"I like it very much myself!\" or \"This is very popular!\". \nNo, Bal d'Afrique has a wonderfully fresh citrus/orange/bergamot blast in the beginning, interlaced with a delicious fruit (must be the blackcurrant), never getting sickly sweet, never acidly citric (you know... like the times when you have to sneeze from all the citrus)... just a wonderful balance between all components... while a faint smokey touch is hovering at the scent's edges. \nThis initial richness of juicy fruits lasts about 20 minutes on my skin and then fades a little, becoming warmer with amber, musk and cedar. The smokey touch also gets a little stronger, but never becomes disgusting (non-smoker writing here).  \nThe only \"drop of bitterness\" in this luscious composition is... longevity is only moderate... after 2-3 hours I barely can smell it anymore on myself. Be prepared to always take it with you to refreshen it after some time, because you just can't live without it. Sillage is weak, so it's very office friendly and wearable too.  \nBal d'Afrique is like nothing I've ever smelled before. The scent invokes a feeling of the zest for life and indulging in its pleasures, while the deeper - and sometimes smokey - layers of your experience of life are always present in the background... not disturbing the present, but also never being forgotten. The picture of a unique life.", "5": "Wow! This is really something - a high quality, unique fragrance. Feminine, sexy, and hard to describe because it's so unusual.\n\nI can detect some of the same fruity notes as in Byredo's 'Pulp', but deployed far more conservatively here to lend a fruity ring rather than fruit overload (as I find with Pulp). \n\nIt holds quite well, giving several hours of fragrance, then eventually dries down to reveal a pleasant vanilla that had been lurking in the background all along.\n\nThis is one that's definitely on my birthday list!\n\nEDIT 3 weeks later: \n\nOh my, how my taste has evolved in a short time.  I still find Bal d'Afrique striking, unique and pleasant, but also now it's obvious that it's unisex.  I can detect a certain animalic undertone, perhaps musk, that is extremely common in high end perfumes but that I have come to dislike on my skin.  \n\nI can definitely imagine this suiting some men.  It's a very worthy candidate for a guy who's looking for a statement fragrance that's different from the common 'clouds of aftershave' frags out there.  It's sexy in a different, more personal way.", "6": "EN. I love the most of Byredo perfumes, but this one is really THE BEST! When you're wearing it, it feels like you're wrapped with love, it some kind of happiness, that remains with you for whole day.\n\nIT. Adoro la maggior parte dei profumi Byredo, ma questo \u00e8 davvero il migliore di tutti! Quando lo indossi, ti senti avvolto di amore. \u00c8 una sorta di felicit\u00e0, che rimane con te per tutta la giornata.", "7": "If I could live in this 24/7, with all the layers I would. It is sumptuous, mysterious and so amazing. I feel like smiling when I wear it and will put it on before bed simply to feel good as I sleep. Simply Gorgeous.", "8": "I never thought this would happen, that I end up falling in love with a Byredo perfume! I was prejudiced because there is such a hype around them. A sales lady who knew the products well introduced these scents to me, when I was curious to know what they are all about. Now I understand. They are special.\nBal D'Afrique is what I wanted to try first, and it was love, and I bought this 120 euro niche perfume for myself, after a heavy work day. I don't regret.\n\nI smelled this  in the crowd before I even knew about it, and thought that I wish I knew what it was. Now I found it!\n\nBal D'Afrique has many notes, there is something very soft and creamy, and then some bright notes in good balance. it's impossible for me to describe it but it matches well with my skin chemistry and my personality. \n\nI wanted to find a niche perfume, something unique and special, and this is it. The longevity is good.", "9": "This is lovely. So effortless, clean, woody and warm, all at the same time. This is for someone enigmatic, mysterious, a bit lowkey. It's like a very elevated Light Blue, not the same but sort of. Smells expensive and luxurious, just not in an ostentatious way. Love!", "10": "I really love the smell of this.  I have some sort of connection to this one.  Spring and Easter, summer and beaches, but not the beach, it\u2019s afterwards when you still have sand between your toes, but now it\u2019s the feel of the cool grass under your feet.  The movie \u201cStand By Me\u201d comes to mind.  A breeze passing through an open window, dancing with the blinds.   The condensation on the cool tile floor after a hot shower.\n\nShe is not aggressive.  She is sweet, kind, caring, gentle and nurturing, but strong and can have an attitude.  She is beautiful, cute, and has great style.  \n\nIs this a sexy fragrance?  Not exactly.  But I do believe the person who wears this can be.  I feel this is more of an \u201cadoring\u201d fragrance and if I were to smell this on someone passing by I would be greatly intrigued and quite happy, followed by a sadness.   It\u2019s amazing how often we come across people who we have so much in common with, possibly a sole mate, yet never say a word, or completely disregard.  \n\nThis fragrance can be uplifting, uncomplicated and welcoming, if given a chance.\n\nAnyways, enough of my weird rambling...  good fragrance.  It\u2019s  sweet, fresh, fruity, floral.  Soft and smooth vetiver, cedar, sandalwood, and of course musk.   Easy to wear,  Unisex leaning feminine, but certainly anyone can wear it, but I think you have to be the right type of person to truly appreciate it.  Soft projection and decent longevity.  This is a wonderfully narrated fragrance.  I like it, I like it a lawt.  \ud83d\ude0a\n\n10/10", "11": "Believe all the nice things you've heard about Bal D'Afrique.\n\nMany times I'm convinced I'm going to absolutely love a fragrance based on the fragrant community chatter.  I get it under my nose, *sniff * and it's...nice.  Bal d'Afrique is also nice.  It's perfectly pleasant, and comfortable but there's something about it that makes it NIIIICE!  It feels like I've found the every man, every woman fragrance but brilliantly imagined.  The perfumer was apparently inspired by his father's journals in the creation of Bal d'Afrique.  I'd love to read the words that inspired this very specific collection of notes in such an expressive arrangement.\n\nI know amalfi lemons are bigger and sweeter than the lemons easily accessible in my area.  I didn't consider the note would be different in fragrance, but I think it is.  It lacks the nose prick I'm accustomed to with lemon.  The opening citrus in Bal D'Afrique is rounder, sweetish and without the typical lemon brightness. It's a wonderful, surprisingly warm start, and it only gets nicer as you sniff on.  \n\nThe heart (vetiver for me) is sneaky in how it surrounds and lures you to unexpected comfort.  It's so easy to wear, though not the floral I imagined of individually recognized beauties.  The blend is so complete as to experience the florals without naming them.   No significant violet or jasmine for me, just...everything with a lovely, feminine vetiver.  I do still smell marigolds in this phase, it's the one exception, though not dominant in any way. I'm not quite sure how/if that's technically different from tagetes, but my nose says marigolds.\n\nVetiver is the last beautiful note standing around me.  It lingers forever on my skin, making this surprisingly nice Byredo offering worth the chatter.  \n\nNoteworthy Notes\nan easy vetiver \nlemon (juicy, warm, slightly sweet)\nmarigolds\nthe brilliant marketing narrative", "12": "Brilliant !!!\nI have over the past couple of months fallen deeply in love with Byredo.\nMost of the perfumes are very unique, the packaging is so minimalistic and brilliant but feels very exclusive at the same time. Everything about this brand is very well thought through. Every detail.\nAlso the fonder Ben Gorham has a very interesting history. Partly Indian partly Canadian. Growing up in India, Canada, Stockholm and New York, he now lives in Stockholm with his wife and kids.\nBal d\u2019Afrique is one of the first creations and also probably the biggest success so far. \nSome years ago when I was still living in Stockholm ( i\u2019m originally Swedish ) everyone who was hot and hip wore and still wears this perfume. It became mainstream with the media and creative crowd. And trust me, there is a lot of it in Stockholm, especially if you live in the inner city areas. \nFor some reason I was a bit reluctant to this brand only because of the big hype.\nBut thankfully I have now opened up and taken some time to discover their fantastic scents. Perhaps partly because I no longer live in Sweden and here in Munich, south Germany, Byredo is not very common. \n\nBal d\u2019Afrique to me stands out with vetiver, lemon and pineapple. Even though it is not listed I get a very clear scent of pineapple. It is very fresh, clean and uplifting. The flower notes are a bit on the feminine side but it\u2019s nicely balanced out with the lemon and vetiver. Sexy and unique in a different way.", "13": "There is not too many fragrances that are smelling so different because of your current mood \u2013 but Bal d\u2019Afrique really does. Sometimes it is sweeter, another time it is more woody and dry. In some days I realy hate this fragrance but in the next I can fall in love whit this masterpiece \u2013 kind of schizophrenic emotions. I feel huge sentiment to Bal d\u2019Afrique because it was one of the first few niche fragrances I bought \u2013 you know this euphoric feeling :-). Also the place where I found it was so unforgettable\u2026 my wonderful vacation in Catalonia, Barcelona. So now when I\u2019m wearing it the pictures form the past develop in my mind. Bal d\u2019Afrique is kind of fresh and herbal but not harsh, not poisonous, very smooth. It is very balmy in the same time and creates airy, a little dusty aura. I can imagine Vicky and Cristina can wear it easily and Woody Allen could as well ;-)", "14": "Bal d'Afrique is basically a vetiver based scent but there's more to that.. It's citrusy, fruity and floral, sweet and creamy but fresh! I get the pineapple accord right off the bat although it's not listed on the notes breakdown.. BdA works perfectly during the warmer days because it's vibrant, cheerful and uplifting.. It's definitely part of my scent rotation and i'm glad to have a bottle in my collection!", "15": "A friend of mine introduced me to Bal d'Afrique while we were shopping... I remember her telling me that it was a huge hit at some point (I, being a fragrance noob at the time, had never heard of it ) and proceeded to spray it on my wrist and all I can remember is that I fell in love straight away but alas! it was a bit out of my price range... Anyway I told my bf about it and how much I loved it and lo and behold he bought it for me as a gift a few months later. I'm so happy to own this, it's such a juicy, carefree and relaxing fragrance. Very fresh and clean. Somehow it smells like freshly cut pineapple and flowers. When I say pineapple I mean when it's ripe and juicy but still fresh and just a bit tart. Just imagine being in a cabin in the woods and it's morning and you are relaxing outside, there are flowers everywhere and it's not too hot out and you decide to cut up some fresh pineapple for breakfast... It's fresh, sweet, floral and woody and yet somehow still classy, go figure! That is what Bal d'Afrique smells like to me. \n\nOpening : pineapple and flowers\nMiddle: zesty pineapple, floral and woody\nDrydown: mostly wooden and fruity skinscent\n\nOn my friend, on the other hands, it smells like tropical candies.", "16": "Byredo is really the house that cornered the market for that cool-girl aesthetic. I love the minimal branding as much as the next Millennial and I have a few favourites (Velvet Haze, Mojave Ghost, Black Saffron). But the best sellers (Gypsy Water & Bal d'Afrique) which took the brand to stratospheric levels of popularity are not my top picks. Catchy names + instagrammable bottles = a fest track to commercial success. I put Bal d'Afrique in the Gypsy Water bracket. They both encapsulate the clean-girl/boy vibe, they are easy to wear, everyday scents that neither say too much about your personality, nor perform particularly well. \n\nBdA has a very bright, invigorating opening I can appreciate. In favour of this offering, I will call it a citrus for citrus haters. Yet, for me, the creamy woody dry down of musk and vetiver is certainly the best part. If you need something indistinct for office wear, this like G Water would be appropriate choices. However, if like me you are a perfume lover you can find equivalents of this blackcurrant and musk that smell and perform far better ie. Initio - Musk Therapy. I think it does the same thing, but better! When it comes to discreet and professional musks, I would lean towards Mojave Ghost rather than BdA, as I find it more interesting and unexpected.", "17": "I don't know why but this fragrance also reminds me of a memory as a few other reviewers have said. Something about this fragrance makes me feel nostalgic and a bit sad.\n\nHaving said that, it's an awesome scent with a very cool, watery effect on me. Very well blended. No notes stick out to me. Definitely perfect for spring and summer and wearable for all occasions. IMO I see this being perfect for women 30+\n\nThe sillage and longevity is appropriate for the kind of scent that it is. It is not sexy or bold. This is not a fragrance for sexy time or clubbing where you might want a powerhouse scent. I personally don't mind that it does hang closer to the skin because I wear this to work and at home around my baby. Not every occasion calls for a beastly fragrance. \n\nIt's expensive, but I'm very pleased with a just a decant.", "18": "I wanted to dislike this becauseit's so expensive but...omg...this is nothing like I've smeled before and yet so familiar in a bizarre way. It's as if it brings back happy memories of my childhood and that's really something unusual because I don't have many... I am addicted now, however, try it before you buy it because it's kind of special. \u2764", "19": "My bottle of Joy! There is calmness, happiness, and pure love in it. It gives vibes such of peace, blue skies, cloudy-sunny day, the freshness of flowers and real confidence. There is a perfect blend of sweet, fruity and floral accords making is highly versatile. Opening is more of fresh, citrusy with the bergamot and orange blast in the wonderful balance of all notes. Love the Smokey hint at the edges of the scent that makes it even more admirable. AMAZING fragrance!", "20": "This is a lovely fragrance which evokes memory from the past. It reminds me of reading a book outside a summer cottage in mid-noon, feeling the breeze and surrounded by trees and soil with patches of grass. It is a very comforting smell.\n\nThe initial spray was citrusy with a hint of green cleanliness (that reminds of being after the shower) but quickly dries down into a wonderful floral woody fragrance with a sweetness of black currant. It is a unique fragrance that seems familiar but you can\u2019t remember where you\u2019ve smelled it.", "21": "I was encouraged recently by a Fragrantica buddy to share this list of my Top 10 Vetiver based frags.... Kindly remember: this is just my opinion... It is based on what ininstictinctively reach for when Vetiver is on my mind and the mood I'm in.... This is a fragrance forum and opinions will surely differ.. That being said, i gladly encourage all to get their noses on these frags and they'll be convinced these are in elite company in terms of Vetiver frags... Like every humble student/reviewer, I gladly welcome the opinions and recommendations of the reader\n\n1. Vetiver Extrait: Roja Dove (My Review says it all)\n2. Encore Noire: Lalique (Dark, Dirty & Complex Vetiver- for those who are daring and enjoy being challenged by their fragrances) For me: Niche quality @ ridiculous price... (See my review please if interested)\n3. Bal D'Afrique: Byredo (Sweet, creamy, and very luxurious vetiver- Black tie/Semi-Formal dinner party worthy). Review to come!\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\n4. Grey Vetiver: Tom Ford (Professional, clean and youthful Vetiver- young guy working in a nice office atmosphere where he wears a tie regularly)\n5. Creed: Original Vetiver (Sophisticated & Squeaky clean Vetiver....- recline having cocktails on a Sunday afternoon at the country club after a few rounds of golf)\n6. Frederic Malle: French Lover \"Bois D'Orage\": (Very herbal, fresh & green Vetiver- Formal occasion Vetiver \"Black Tie\" worthy, power longevity 12hrs)\n7. Frederic Malle: Vetiver Extraordinaire: (Head-turning Vetiver, like the inside of a chest in a library, crispier & more spicy than most of the rest)- I find this beats Malle's other Vetiver offering in slightly cooler temps and for evening wear when you wanna make that bold statement.......!\n8. Guerlain: Vetiver (An essential in ANY serious collector's wardrobe.... This DNA is the basis for the majority of Vetivers on the market today.... Would be higher on my list, but Roja Dove took it to the SUPREME level....\n9. The Different Company: Sel De Vetiver (Salty, grapefruit Vetiver, a perfect balance of an aquatic & earthy, grassy, woody vetiver- eerily similar to Guerlain's Vetiver- not sure I can really tell them apart in a blind side-by-side test!\n10. Vetiver Veritas: James Heeley (lots of depth, dark in a similar manner to encore noire, but not as well blended. Very natural smelling, but definitely NOT for everyone......., THIS ONE IS A POWERHOUSE MEANT FOR THE MORE DARING NOSES)- this is a true-to-life interpretation of Haitian Vetiver.....\n\nUPDATE:  June 1st/2016\nJust got my hands on a bottle of Hermes Vetiver Tonka and the DNA is identical...  That being said..., Ben Gorham (Byredo Founder) took the composition to a much much higher level..  The African Orange Flower & Marigold is beautifully interwoven into the composition and so magically well done\u2026\u2026\u2026. For me- this makes Bal D'Afrique the superior blend at a discount....", "22": "This thing smells amazing and is definitely long lasting on my skin, during the dry down you get the vetiver more, until then its more like a nice herbal lemon creamy scent off of my skin... when i first sprayed it and was doing some chores i got whiffs of it and it smelled amazing so i think this scent is whiff-amazing rather than directly smelling it off your skin, i love perfumes that do that, a definite 10/10 for me\n\nI tried not a perfume with it and yes it adds more to it longevity and projection wise but this is more than good/enough on its own", "23": "i mean it\u2019s a masterclass in how to perfect a seemingly simple note like lemon. bc it\u2019s so subtle it takes longer to fully understand and appreciate these nuances. sweet, sour, floral, light, fresh, creamy.", "24": "This review is for the Bal d Afrique hair perfume.  I own four Byredo hair scents (Blanche, Biblioteque, Mohave Ghost, and this lovely Bal DAfrique), which collectively cost less than one large bottle of Byredo EDP.  They last very well and are convenient for purse or gym bag.  Not overpowering for a conservative office, and since they are used at head level, I tend to enjoy them more myself.  Be ready for numerous compliments when hugging and greeting friends!\n\nNow on to THIS scent.  I agree wholeheartedly with Vanilla Pandas review and could not have said it better.  I will add that while unisex, it does not have \u201cthat\u201d unisex aspect to it.  It is truly lovely on anyone, with any degree of casual or formal dress.  Clean, classy, and not overpowering.  It has a very unique universality to it!  I have not yet met one person who does not like this scent.", "25": "Instant like at first sniff. No notes that offended me. Very wearable. I'd say more for day ,say a nice lunch date with a friend,somewhere glamorous,like Scott's in Mayfair. This is a very smart casual scent. It exudes class and smells warm and pretty. No one will be overpowered ,just quiet class.  A good blind buy.", "26": "I get a juicy pineapple smell for the first few hours. Also with some hints of coconut. Makes me think of pi\u00f1a colada. It's so obvious to me that I was very surprised to see that none of these notes are listed. The The drydown reminds me a lot of Prada Infusion d'Iris.", "27": "What a unique fragrance! I blind bought this as I do with a lot of my perfumes some are great hits, some not so. This one is a hit for me.I got a citrusy ,lemon/lime smell to begin with, then the most amazing smell of the tegete, so beautiful, so different. On checking out the odour profile I discovered that Tegete is a member of the marigold family which explains my instant like. As it settles I get the orange flower and the hint of jasmine then it warms down to a musky amber. It has sweetness going on but not sickly sweet, it has an indolic vibe about it but not heady.It is a very well blended concoction from Byredo that I'm glad I purchased. It's illage is moderate and the same goes for longevity.", "28": "I tried this before, likely when I lived in Minnesota, and wasn't overly impressed. Now I'm in Haiti, things are considerably different. \n\nThis is one of the weirdest scents from it's initial burst to it's development, and probably the only love of mine which has an opening that I hate!\n\nThe opening is straight up toxic hairspray. Not the nice smelling kind, but the old school stuff that choked everyone out of the bathroom when you did your touch-up on your 4-inch high bangs . . . Yes. That hairspray.\n\nBut almost as quickly as it will burn off your nose-hairs, it mellows into a delightful juicy, fresh, fruity, delight. It's almost tropical, but doesn't quite get there. It's tart and on the bitter edge, never really very sweet, which makes it brilliant for these painfully hot days we've been having.\n\nAnd it lasts, unlike many citrus based scents, thanks to the vetiver.\n\nI would say this is a scent that needs heat. And the more heat the better. Humidity won't intimidate it either. It cuts right through that without being overwhelming at all.\n\nIt's fresh and juicy without being \"sporty\" or boring. Again, I think the vetiver plays a role in that. This is a scent for a confident man or woman. I find it completely unisex. But I feel it will suit a feminine woman or a masculine man just perfectly. You wear this scent, it doesn't wear you.\n\nOkay, enough kissing up to perfume, let me just find me a bottle!", "29": "Outstanding!! Exemplary fusion of notes.. I can almost detect each one..The marigold, vetiver, cedar wood, buchu, and bergamot  definitely.. I also agree that even though pineapple is not listed as a note there's something or a combination of somethings that mimic the smell of a sweet smoky pineapple. Listed as unisex and I agree, but leaning more towards the masculine..I love smelling this scent on myself and it is a stylish and creative blend.. Longevity and silage are decent, but honestly not necessarily concerned with silage for the first time . This fragrance i will be selfish about, what I mean by that is I really don't  care if anyone else can smell it as long as I can!!", "30": "My favourite perfumes go in this order: Tiempe Passate, Stella Peony in Two and Bal D'Afrique, out of so many lovely perfumes I own.  Bal D'Afrique is special. It does not smell like any other perfume; it is distinctively different  - very soft, intelligent and extremely classy. There is nothing loud, screechy, or synthetic here. It is one that I get a lot of compliments on and asked what I'm wearing. My daughter now associates this with the cozy, dreamy comfort of being with her mother, but it is also a scent of some depth and mystery.   It's a truly stunning, perfectly blended, special scent - slightly creamy and powdery, the most subtle use of violets and a dance of African marigolds, wrapped in a faintly woody, elegant cedar base.  A masterpiece does not come shouting, it sometimes just is waiting to be discovered.", "31": "My sample is about to run out so I need to do this review STAT! (Yes, it's about to run out because I'm continuing to reapply; don't judge).\n\nWhen I first smelled this, I thought it was some special magic potion with a heck of a lot of foreign nobody-has-ever-heard-of ingredients because it was THAT magnetic!\n\nThe initial lemon bergamot is there and is extremely pleasant. Not an overpowering citrus with a soft jammy blackcurrant! It quickly dries down to a gorgeous cyclamen, jasmine, and violet combination - Which, granted being three of my favourite florals, is probably why I'm adoring this. Finishing with a woody musk is heady gloriousness.\n\nI'd love to get me a bottle immediately; however, Byredo prices are gut-twisting. Furthermore, this has...fairly unimpressive sillage. Its longevity does exist as a fabulous skin scent, but it won't ever blast anyone out of a room.\n\nI do honestly see this as unisex fragrance for any man or woman who can handle smelling elegant. I'm a heterosexual female, and if I smelt this on a girl, I'd appreciate her cultivated style. If I smelt this on a guy, I wouldn't want to peel myself away from him.\n\n***\n\nKitty rating: 9/10.", "32": "I really get the hype, I do. It is smooth from the first spray to the dry down. The scent resembles no other fragrance, it's definitely one of a kind and a signature scent worthy for both men and women. There is sweetness that is not gourmand-y, nor is fruity to me, even though I know now that some fruits do present here. My kind of sweet actually since I don't usually appreciate candy sweet. The florals in here are very subtle on my nose yet it makes the whole experience divine. I just hope this will last a proper length of time for me.", "33": "This is one of those scents that I fell instantly in love with. If a bright orange, fiery sunset had a smell, this would be it in my opinion. I know there are no oranges listed, but I keep thinking of an orange creamsicle every time I smell my arm. It\u2019s delicious and gorgeous and I just can\u2019t get enough. It\u2019s not too much of anything, very well balanced in every sense...not too feminine or too masculine, not too fruity or floral,  seems like something you could wear in every season, although maybe best in summer and spring. I\u2019ll have to take more notes on the lasting power before I splurge on a full bottle, but for me I think this one might be worth having to reapply throughout the day.", "34": "I love how this fragrance is blended. I think this is a sophisticated scent that can be worn by male and females. There is something about this that sometimes reminds me of Prada Infusion D'Iris. Must be the orange flower, vetiver and cedar? I think it would be wonderful in the fall by a campfire or among the scent created by autumn leaves.", "35": "Masterpiece, no doubt.\n\nI bumped into Byredo out of sheer luck while travelling.\n\nSince I didn't know much about niche - in fact, about perfume in general - I discovered that day what the big guys were all about!\n\nFor the first time ever, I felt a fragrance encompassed my personality and the grown-up self I'd be striving to become someday.\n\nIt pertains both frontal honesty and complexity of character.\n\nFrontal honesty from that joyous, exuberant citrusy opening. \nAlthough pineapple isn't listed, it's very prominent on my skin. Fresh, bright and luminous.\n\nBut fear not, this is not a fruit salad!  \n\nThere's a level of sophistication I haven't found to match since then.\n\nIts smoky sultriness and sexiness are all down to high intellect. \n\nFlorals are heady, with that spiciness you usually get from tuberose, only so much more refined.\n\nVetiver is marvelously frank, cedar and amber are supremely elegant, in silence.\n\nI visualise a confident, warm mannered woman wearing a skin hugging, yet austere outfit - no skin showing.\n\nYet, that fragrance's cheekiness balances out the severity of her clothing. \n\nYou'd take this woman very seriously, for the undebatable aura of intelligence, culture and refinement she exudes.\n\nThat's my idea of ultimate seduction: facetious, obviously smart and elegant. \n\nNot unlike some great songs, I discover something new every time I'm wearing that perfume.\nThat satisfies my love for layers and layers of complexity!\n\nDespite this perfume is aligned in many ways with my personality, I wouldn't consider it my signature fragrance.\n\nBeing a child at heart, this perfume is definitely for grown up women! \nOr men, because it's perfectly unisex.\n\nBal d'Afrique\u2019s element would be Earth, to which I associate seriousness and some form of conservatism.\n\nWhile I love too much being irreverent, candid and etheric. \n\nBlind buy not recommended.", "36": "I HATE Vetiver Tonka.  Smells like vetiver and cheap cigarettes. I LOVE this stuff.  Very airy and fruity", "37": "Irresistible, earthy, sensual and deep yet discreet, this mix of musk and woody base beautifully blended with vetiver and some flowers is lovely. Very unisex and will be appealing on either male or female skin. Suitable for a secret love affair with yourself.", "38": "A burst of life! FRESH and SWEET ,,,,, a Happy lemon explosion with lots of sweetness and a warm base. I love this one ! It's a happy scent , it's zesty and lifely and oh so sweet , ,very fruity at first and addictive then settled into a rounder, still very sweet but not as zesty scent. The amber and vetevier appear and the ceder. Great for men and women for sure and I am happy about the violet note in here. As I love violets I wish it was stronger but it's still there to give it sweetness and slight pharmacy candy feel. Very slight , maybe just if you look for it ;) \nA winner!\nLike a few other reviews I hate vetevier tonka and love this one. There might be a similarity but there also is a huge difference. I love this and can't wear the other. The VT has a sickly note in it that I couldn't tolerate and gave it away.", "39": "I purchased a decant, after reading the reviews and wow- love it!  I like that it's subtle and light, as Hubby and the in-laws are not keen on fragrance but something about the first 30 minutes of it on my wrist reminds me of a pina colada and as most reviews didn't resonate with my experience, I actually wondered if the place I purchased the decant had given me the correct fragrance!.  Seems like it is very different on various skin chemistries indeed!  It could become a permanent signature scent, I love it so much!  I'd say it is definitely feminine;  I cannot imagine a guy wearing this at all.  Fairly weak longevity /projection, so you'd need to top up pretty much hourly, I'd say.", "40": "I decided to update my review after finishing my sample, I am actually considering going for a 50ml of Bal d'Afrique, one of the few Byredos, aside from Gypsy Water and possibly Pulp that feel like they were created with some inspiration, although the inflated price is still a strong deterrent.\n\nTo my nose, the strength of Bal d'Afrique is the intricate blending of several facets, namely the way it blends the powdery floral genre with a slightly fruity woody citrus. Clearly this is a vetiver fragrance in disguise, a very tasteful muted vetiver alla Diptyque Vetyverio hiding in the back. Up top a sweet citrus (grapefruit to my nose) that transitions into a taste blackcurrant similar to Floraiku One Umbrella for Two but less intensely gourmand. Surrounding the notes, vanilla, a good amount of powdery ionones, warm fuzzy musks clouding the scent making it feel like a creamy gentle haze.\n\nTo me it feels a bit feminine leaning, but given its woody backbone feels comfortable to wear as a man, especially if you are ok with the more 'metrosexual' powdery masculines like Dior Homme Intense. I am still deciding between Bal d'Afrique and Gypsy Water, but both are definitely worth sampling.", "41": "Unlike other niche bestsellers, Bal d'Afrique by Byredo looks the most elegant and subtle, compared with the overweight Baccarat Rouge, Black Afgano, Kirke, Roses Musc and even Fleur Narcotique. There is no overdose of any of the components, and no redundancy in any of the parameters. If the fragrance could be photographed, then the photo of Bal d'Afrique would become an Instagram phenomenon: bright, glossy, intellectual and fashionable. However, Ben Gorham definitely knows a lot about making a product that, with mass production and sales, retains the status of a certain elitism.\n\nBal d'Afrique opens with a fresh, slightly soapy accord of orange blossom and neroli with a green-white floral scent that gradually sinks into a growing accord of sweet chocolate-nutty notes with smoky green vetiver. This part of the fragrance echoes the Mugler's Angel Muse. But there is not further development \u2014 unfortunately, from this point the perfume composition begins to weaken, and become more and more vapid.", "42": "Bright, uplifting delightful everyday summer scent. It is sweet citrusy with woody undertones and leans feminine. Smells like tranquility and transports you to a calm and cozy place.

I also left Byredo after using up a bottle of Pulp as the company grew and became a part of animal testing in China. Now, I am waiting for them to become truly cruelty free (as China has changed their rules on the requirements of animal testing) so I can get my hands on this extraordinary creation that...I...just...need...soo badly. It is so beautiful to me I could cry. Sigh...this might not make sense...but this fragrance smells deeply blue/purple to me (energy prob) and very feminine, not even unisex. An indigo fairytale.\n\nIt lasts many hours on me (if I over do it)...leaving a mystical trail. I don't separate the notes in my experience...and to me, it is def not a citrus scent at all, except for a ray in the beginning. Like a beautiful song, I's almost as if we don't hear instruments, vocals and beats as much as the cretion itself. It is sweet, it draws you in, it's hypnotic while being pure and clean. An angelic scent that I had been looking for forever was right under my nose.\n\nDivain - great dupe, not as deep\nOakcha - terrible", "45": "This is just gorgeous. I get really lovely fresh cut tropical pineapple on me with a very light woody dry down - although I note pineapple isn't listed as a note. However while I only have nice things to say, I'm not sure I can justify the $235 asking price in Australia.", "46": "My first exposure to Bal D'Afrique was when a hotel I was staying in had Byredo amenities scented with this fragrance. My partner at the time and I both commented on the scent and remarked how much we liked it. In fact, his exact words were - \"If this came in a cologne I would wear it.\" At the time, neither of us had yet experienced Byredo fragrances so we didn't know the scent actually did come bottled. Life got in the way and we forgot all about it when leaving the hotel. It wasn't until I was poking around in the bathroom cupboard a few months later that I noticed that my partner had taken some of the amenities from the hotel and stashed them away. A quick sniff of the shampoo/conditioner/body wash scented with Bal D'Afrique reignited my love for this gorgeous scent. Fast forward to a couple of months later (again) and I was poking around in Mecca (the only retailer here in Australia that stock Byredo). I spotted the familiar words 'Bal D'Afrique' on a label and instantly spritzed it, and, again, loved it. I feel like the universe was sending me a sign that I had to own it.\nI'm a big fan of oriental/woody fragrances with a touch of floral notes, but it can be difficult finding something that 'hits the spot.' In my experience, a lot of spicy floral fragrances are either too weak, too strong, too headache-inducing, too nauseating. It can be a difficult category to get just right. For me, Bal D'Afrique does exactly that, which is why I shelled out a pretty penny for it. I'll be honest - the price of it was borderline extortionate, and I had a pretty hard time justifying spending several hundred dollars on a bottle. It's to date still the most expensive perfume I have in my collection. Is it a gorgeous fragrance? Yes. Do I still believe it's overpriced? Yes. It'd be nice to have this sitting at a slightly more accessible price point, because I'd love to be able to replace this bottle when it runs out.\nHaving said that, this is a wonderfully complex fragrance that unfurls so nicely on my skin. Upon first spray, I get a chermoula-like smell, which I think can be equated to a mix of something like black pepper, cumin, saffron, coriander, and cayenne pepper. Underneath that lies a gorgeous floral (cyclamen and violet) with woody undertones (cedarwood and vetiver). The top, mid, and base notes all seem to melt into one another in a beautiful and perfect harmony. It's undeniably vibrant and sensual.\nIn my opinion, both the sillage and longevity are moderate. Could be worse, but could be better. I do wish they were slightly more intense, especially given what you're paying for it, but I can still smell the fragrance on my skin and clothing a couple of hours after application, so I'm happy about that. It does disappear after these initial few hours though, and I really have to press my nose against my wrist to smell it.\nI'm a huge fan of Byredo bottles, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't have this nagging feeling inside to run out and buy all of them. The simple, minimalistic design that extends to all the fragrances with the individual name uniformly printed on the label is a big plus from me. I have Bal D'Afrique sitting on a mirror tray on my bedside table and it looks so luxe. This juice was my first introduction into the world of luxury/niche fragrances, and it was a great one to encourage me to dip my toes in that pond. Just lovely.", "47": "Creamy fruits and citrus in the opening which increase in sweetness and warmth when they dry down. Always stays fresh and clean though. Perfect all year round.

Wasn\u2019t born a sheep. \nI\u2019m no clubber, but this is a beautiful playful and highly pleasing scent. I get compliments galore, and more importantly from my wife. Love it. It\u2019s a well blended fragrance comprising of vanilla and pear as it\u2019s stand out notes. In comes the mint, cinnamon and amber to form a base to round it off. \nThis is a masterpiece. Go and test it, put any biases you may have been given away and judge it for it\u2019s scent alone. Scent has no barriers, if it smells good it smells good.  \nI wear this in the cooler evenings as a date night or casual get togethers.", "1": "Release in summer 2015 and so many dislikes already???\nCome on!!\nShow some respect please!", "2": "Jean Paul Gaultier has been experimenting with Le Male flankers for quite some time now, so one shouldn't be surprised to find out the general public was rather skeptical of this release, coming off the heels of Le Male Terrible and Le Beau Male. Both of those offered something different than the original, sort of, Terrible being a permanent release of a limited summer formula with a little tinkering; and Beau being a rather soft and weak green spring juice with the lavender, wormwood and musk dominating but not impressing the average consumer. Both were widely panned at the time of their release. Gaultier's staff finally seem to have been paying attention to the target market of 30 and under consumers with the release of Ultra. This is 1 Million and L'Homme Intense in its heavy reliance on spicy sweetness and powerful radiance meant for the club circuit. \nThe pear in this makes Ultra rather unique, despite sticking to a rather commercial and standard formula. This pear note is rather shocking in its balance with the rest of the heavier accords, Kurkdijan deserves a good deal of recognition and credit for balancing the whole accord and not taking it in uglier directions after the top notes dissipate like in One Million. Instead you get a very steady, rather linear club and night scent that knows its bounds but remains a top performer and projection monster without really being a monster at all. The longevity here is outstanding, at 10-12 hours with just 2-3 sprays and sillage is top-flight, but not overbearing like so many other releases born of the same blood. The sillage on Ultra can best be described as a restrained powerhouse, the balance so brilliantly executed by Kurkdijan that this lacks the imposing qualities of the original vintage Le Male potion. \nThe vanilla is still there, the lavender, mint and cinnamon as well, but Ultra takes something very familiar here and injects a major innovation with the pear note, a note that lasts well into the heart of Ultra Male. A great alternative for those of you looking for something for the winter that could work as a club, date or work scent as long as you are conservative on the trigger.  \nScent: 4.25 (out of 5)\nLongevity: 4.5\nSillage: 5 \nOriginality: 4.25 \nOverall Quality: 4.5 \nAn outstanding flanker and improvement on previous false starts by the Gaultier house. Not as original or innovative as Kokoriko, but by playing it safer here and focusing their energies on composition and balance, they've found something original and familiar at once that performs outstandingly, especially in the context of its mid 2010's contemporaries.", "3": "sergie.allen - Why the constant reviews? I would imagine one review is plenty and if you can't help yourself then just edit the one over and over and over!!! \nOh my, there are EIGHTEEN reviews, yes 18 on this one alone!??

In a PM he insisted that he will keep posting them!", "4": "To save the suspense, I love this fragrance. This review is based on 3 full wearings after blind-buying a bottle, not just casually sampling it at a dept store. For starters, this does NOT smell like One Million, and anyone who says so is making a lazy comparison because they're both sweet. Instead, you get the smoothness of the lavender and vanilla of the original Le Male with a sweet, somewhat dark pear note and hints of cinnamon replacing the mint of the original. JPG has turned this into a smooth, addicting blend that I have increasingly enjoyed the more that I wear it. Warning, the initial blast of the top notes will turn some people off hence the \"I sprayed this at Macys and hated it\" reviews. Stick with it and you'll be rewarded with a modern, unique, sweet, sexy fragrance that will appeal to both Le Male lovers and those that are tired of it and want a different take.  \nPerformance: 7.5 - Performs well above average. I get about 8 hours with solid projection for about four. Not the bomb that the original Le Male formulation is but better than most new designer releases. \nOverall Scent: 9/10 - I can't get enough of this one right now, sweetness smoothed out with lavender that works in pretty much any setting except formal. A crowd-pleaser and my favorite new designer release in a while.", "5": "Made a profile on here just to pay respect to this masterpiece.

I have only had that feeling with Aventus, One Million (I know wtf), and now this :D Definitely 10000% going to buy this next week!\n\nGive it a sniff, you might fall in love ;) I Will write a full review when I grab a bottle & fingers crossed it will perform good on my skin.", "8": "Ultra Male hit the market in 2015, after about seven other versions of Le Male have been released, only in the year 2014. And the impression I have, now and again, is that this was the last gasp from the Gaultier House to try to regain some of the prestige that exists behind the iconic Le Male (1995).\nMuch has been discussed about the subject and the reformulations that made the fragrance weaker (both in projection and longevity), according to reports of thousands of users around the world.\n\nUltra Male was designed to be \"ultra\" in all aspects and was announced as an Eau de Toilette Intense version loaded with spices and even more powerful of the original version. The perfumer chosen for this task was, once again, Francis Kurkdjian.\nIt has notes of black lavender, pear, mint, and bergamot on the output. Then, it combines notes of cinnamon, cumin, clary sage and black dahlia (little published on websites, blogs, and Brazilian stores and also know as Black Aztec Flower). Finally, it presents a more gourmand base, with notes of black vanilla, patchouli, amber, and cedar.\n\nThe result came out better than expected! The basic DNA of the Le Male line, which is built on the notes of mint, lavender, cedar, and vanilla, can be felt in the midst of the floral and gourmands nuances of this scent. When applied, presents a strong mint on a stylish Lavender. And the pear note is juicy and unusual. A delight!\nAs evolves, I feel myself taken by an immense feeling of \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\", because the body of the fragrance presents nuances of various other scents on the market. This is the most delicate part of the composition because opens space for dozens of comparisons since each smell sense works one way. Some people compare it with scents of the A*Men line (because the nuance of patchouli is similar), some say that looks like Black XS, Polo Red and also 1 Million. A danger! I saw a comparison with Spicebomb without cinnamon and tobacco. But wait a minute...Spicebomb without the cinnamon and the tobacco is not the Spicebomb!\n\nWell, what matters is that I did many tests, comparing side by side with other scents in my collection and nothing matched, but the feeling I've ever felt that scent anywhere else remained. Then, finally, my olfactory memory jumped in the past and I could identify what would be: Body Kouros. But wait, it's not over yet!\nAs time goes by, the black vanilla and the patchouli, from the base, prove that they are of good quality and give a nocturnal appeal to the fragrance, which is not necessarily made for the party people but can fill that gap without effort.\n\nUltra Male proved, at least on my skin, to be a more modern version of the classic from 1995. And the closest I can get to a comparative parameter (without generalizing), would be to say that it is a mixture of Le Male with a hug of Body Kouros (YSL) and a few drops of Au Masculin (Lolita Lempicka).\nThis time, the bottle received a dark blue paint and the stripes of the sailor's shirt are black, reinforcing the nighttime aspect. The projection is scary and exceeds 12 hours, mainly in the hairy areas of the body, such as arms and chest. It is worth saying that the compliments come from all sides.\n\nIt is not a substitute for Le Male, but I think that, for now, will silence the critics. Francis Kurkdjian made it again.", "9": "JPG Ultra Male.\n\nNot Ultra Male, but a very very very sexy scent.\nGirls go wild.

You can literally wear this any time, any day - just moderate your sprays. It smells SO sweet (not in a sickening way), but it is hard to imagine anyone being bothered by this even in an office. Granted, I would not recommend bathing it in for work, but 1-2 sprays even in an office can provide a really pleasant and comfortable sillage. I do see this as a more youthful scent as it is sweet and playful, but I honestly think anyone can pull this off. It is just great. \nI 100% would recommend this to anyone.", "14": "Oh.. I don't know about all the comments that this is a super sweet, teenager, clubbing fragrance.  I find this a very pleasant and mature fragrance.  I'm in my 50's and have no problems wearing this.  Just yesterday I was wearing it as a day fragrance and nobody finds it as a clubber frag.  The dry down is really nice and mature.  I think its a fragrance for anyone at any time.  Vanilla, cedar, sage and pear?  Sounds rather old fashioned to me ;-)\n\nIt is what YOU make of it.  I think it smells great and it suits older fragheads just as well as greenhorns.  Its not cloying in the least, even in warmer rooms or climate.  Its really pretty low key but it lasts a good long while and softly projects throughout.", "15": "This is the best Le Male flanker i've tried in years.\n\nI don't even like the original Le Male anymore, since the reformulation it acts as a skin scent on me, but this projects really nice as it's not too much and it's not too little.\n\nThe scent itself reminds me of Halloween, it's the time of year where Treacle candy, toffee apples and lots of other sweets and sugary foods come out to play.\n\nWith Halloween in mind this scent paints the picture of a warm baked Pear covered in syrup. It has a real warm sweet vibe.\n\nI would say give this a try if you're into sweet scents, this fragrance does have a gourmand nature to it.", "16": "Say what you will about the use of synthetics, this is one of the best scents ever created. It's fruity and sharp, but it also has a laundry dryer sheet feel to it. Like a pear flavored laundry sheet, in a bubble gum shop. This is one of my favorite fragrances ever. The performance is ballistic. It blows Creed and all the other niche scents, of which I own a few, that go for +$200 out of the water. It just smells gorgeous and it lasts. What's not to love. \n\nSynthetics are like the use of CG in movies, too much of it, makes you sick. But done right you get a masterpiece film like Dunkirk or The Matrix. This is a masterpiece in it's respected genre. \n\n10/10 On All Levels", "17": "This is one of my absolute favorites. It's just flat out delicious smelling, and I could see it being a very nice fragrance to wear on a date. It opens with an immediate blast of vanilla and pear, along with cinnamon, that is just sexy. A strange combination to be sure, but it works big time. For me it never really changes from that and stays linear. In my opinion it doesn't have the spice that Le Male has and is it's own spray. Better IMO\n\nIt projects very well and can be smelled from around 8-10 ft away easily. It also lasts quite a while, 7-8 on my bare skin. Be careful not to over spray this, 3 sprays max, as it really is a beast out the gate and hours afterwards.\n\nHonestly can't say enough about this, but I would warn that summer usage is probably a no go. I could see this type of scent not mixing well with the hot weather, sweaty skin. If you're looking for a good, cool nights date fragrance, this is the one. \n\nIt is somewhat feminine, but I don't feel it is too feminine to wear for men at all. Your girl certainly won't think you smell feminine in my opinion. I have yet to test it with my special someone, and I'm hoping she likes it. \n\n10/10 Simply because it's so successful at being the type of fragrance it is supposed to be. A sexy, attention grabbing, cool weather, instant chic magnet.

I ended up going back to confirm it, and ultimately ended up with a bottle after smelling it vs the rest of the options at the counter (Polos, Varvatos, Armanis, Versaces, D&Gs, Diors, etc). I like sweet smells so this one is pretty outstanding with that fruity vanilla-cinnamon fougere smell. The opening sweet fruit smells like pineapple bubblegum but apparently it's pear. The fougere dry down is that Le Male DNA I suppose, and it smells pleasant, aromatic, and of good quality. Ladies LOVE it, even enough to want to wear it themselves! I have full bottles and samples of Kurkdjian's private line, but this one released under JPG is seriously good especially considering the price/performance (long lasting, heavy sillage for sure). The guy is a total boss and easily my favorite perfumer at the moment! \n\nA 10 out of 10 designer frag for me, and I love it from the opening to the drydown long thereafter :)", "21": "I love the contrast that JPG has unwittingly created with this frag - from the uber-masculine, 'ripped body' bottle design, to the name 'Ultra Male' - it gives the impression that upon spraying you'll be greeted by a wall of powerful, pungent machismo that most mere mortals will find difficult to handle.\n\nAnd then you spray.\n\nAnd you're greeted with the one of the most delicious, sweet, metrosexual scents in the designer game.\n\nMake no mistake about it: the ladies amongst us could wear this fragrance with relative ease and no one would be any the wiser.\n\nOpens with that sweet, fruity dominant pear note, supported subtly by a spicy vanilla / cinammon aura. Amber becomes more evident in the late dry down, but besides that there's nothing else to speak of here in terms of development.\n\nDespite being linear (and yes, synthetic), this fragrance's strength lies in it's performance. You simply will not find longevity and sillage like this at this price point. To stress this point, here is an example: I once wore two sprays of this to work. I arrived 45 minutes after initial application and as I walked through the door, my boss said to me, \"Jesus Christ, did you take a bath in perfume before you came in this morning?\"\n\nI'm honestly surprised the general concensus seems to be that the sillage from this is anything other than enormous. It will utterly devour a room, no word of a lie.\n\nIn summary, Ultra Male is exceptionally good at what it does. It's a sweet, fruity, seductive, performance powerhouse that your female friends will most likely adore, and probably want to steal from you. For use exclusively in outdoor / nightclub / late bar / large gathering (such as festivals) or cold weather situations.", "22": "Sweet, playful, sexy.

The pear is absolutely the dominating note at the top of this fragrance. It is a thick, syrupy pear and smells so good. As the fragrance develops, it stays sweet throughout the whole life to my nose. Some people say it gets like woody/spicy but I don't really get that. To me, it's a sweet vanilla/pear through and through. Maybe just a hint of spice towards the base but really nothing too crazy. Sure, it's a great clubbing scent, but you can wear it anytime you want in the fall and winter. It's not purely for clubbing as some people say, don't believe that. Ultra male projects like a monster and lasts forever which I'm always happy about! 2-4 sprays with this scent and you're good to go for the whole day and night.

Now smells more like a  A*Men flanker to be honest and I love it!\n\nOn my skin is almost too strong in the opening, but after the initial blast the projection calms down (still a beast!) but without to be overwhelming(2-3 sprays). The longevity is also awesome, +12h on my skin.\n\nNot the most original, masculine or versatile fragrance, but deserve a place in my collection, and I can't wait to wear it more in upcoming chilly days.\n\n7,5-8/10", "31": "That was the true love from the first sight. The definition of a Player. Pretty, loud, a little bit cocky but always nice and mild. When you want to go clubbing, but Eros seems too harsh and common for you, than Ultra Male is actually what you need. Incredible. 10/10.", "32": "Hi all there,\nTo me Ultra Male is a gorgeous new scent from JPG \u2013 woody, spicy, earthy, juicy, a little sweet as well, but everything is smooth and sophisticated. \nI think it is a mature scent, because it got more depth and different faces. Ultra Male will shine best at winter, especially on Christmas time, when the cinnamon, vanilla and amber notes can give cozy and warm feeling.\n\nLongevity on me is excellent \u2013 more than 8-10 hours.\nSillage is very good too, so I can only admire Ultra Male performance.\n\nFinal words \u2013 Ultra Male is a great spicy-woody scent, with perfect mix of vanilla, amber and cinnamon notes. I think man over 30 will appreciate that beauty. \nThe only complain I have is the bottle \u2013 I think Ultra male deserves a new name, a whole new presentation with more matured design of the bottle \u2013 something like Carbone de Balmain or Essenze line by Ermenegildo Zegna.", "33": "For me, this is spectacular on the opening. I'm on my second bottle and performance is still beast mode. Didn't like the original 'Le Male' but this one I love as it is a lot less powdery. We have to give credit to this house who delivers a lot on the longevity and projection departments. Thumbs way up for this beauty.\n\n9/10", "34": "Tried this today and instantly reminded me of Lolita Lempicka Midnight Au Masculin. It is sweeter and has a lot of vanilla. You really don't need to spray a lot of this on it is very strong. Fantastic longevity and it lasts forever. A pleasant surprise and I have to admit, I'm baffled how this is supposed to be a flanker? It has nothing to do with the original. This could have stood alone as a brand new JPG fragrance in a completely different bottle.", "35": "Description: A sweet fragrance with heavy projection. Dominant notes are pear, cinnamon, and vanilla. \n\nThoughts: \"Juicy\" is the word I would use to describe this fragrance. The pear note shines throughout the fragrance's life. I'm not a fan of the original Le Male, so if you're not a fan either don't be scared from trying this one out. This is one fragrance where I really can't think of any negatives other than it simply not being one's style.  \n\nScore: 5/5", "36": "Scent 9/10\nProjection 8/10\nLongevity 9/10\nValue 9/10\nOverall 9/10\nI was noticed, It garners compliments.\n\nExcellent frag from JPG and the best of the flankers to le male.

Truly in a league of its own!", "38": "Ok. I don\u2019t get any bubblegum and i don\u2019t think this is exclusively a club fragrance.  It\u2019s much better than that. So iintoxicating and inviting uou can\u2019t stop smelling yourself.  Mfk does it again", "39": "The opening is very sweet with a nice dominating pear, complemented by lavender and a small amount of mint which becomes more prominent as the pear dies down. The heart of the fragrance is where the spice comes in with a great cinnamon scent dominating. On the base I get a great mix of vanilla and amber that seems to be lasting a very long time on my skin.\n\nThe presentation of this EDT was different to any other fragrance that I had previously purchased. The bottle came sealed inside a large tin cylinder, pop off the bottom of the tin and these sits the male torso shaped bottle held tightly in place on the inside surface, very well presented.\n\n- Longevity: 7-12 hours\n- Sillage: Strong\n- Wearability: Autumn, Winter, Spring\n- Versatility: Clubbing, Nights out. Possibly office & social if you hold back on sprays.", "40": "As so often when it's a men's fragrance I find myself hard pressed to describe any notes or development.\n\nIt's quite sweet, but definitely very masculine. It's loud and it last and last and lasts. A few times it even survived a machine wash on my husband's shirt. I was shocked!\n\nSo do I like it? Absolutely, it has a very sexy vibe. But I do see it more as a party/night fragrance. It's not that great of a fit with formals or for visiting your parents in my opinion.\n\nIt's a bit rough around the edges, sexy yes, but loud to a point where it could become obnoxious if you pressed the sprayer down once too much. It can be an amazing sexy head turner in the right situation and with the right dosage, definitely! But I can also envision scores of younger guys dousing themselves in it following the ancient wooing tactics of rendering the female unconscious - even if not with a club but with the brute force of a fragrance - to pull her into the cave.\n\nIntense performance in sillage and longevity. Loving it! But caution as to when and how to apply.", "41": "Simply the best ultra sweet fragrance I have ever tried. Sweet, thick, fruity syrup, drenched over a signature Francis Kurkdjian fabric softener base. Strong during the opening and maintains a decent level of strength during the drydown. Never unpleasant or cloying. Really well done and my gf absolutely loves it! 10/10", "42": "If you already like the following -> Versace Eros, One Million, Invictus, Spicebomb then you'll froth over Ultra Male. Dense, Sweet, Vanilla, Cinnamon, Almost chocolatey vibes I get from this. VERY Seductive, could just about eat it!\n\nThis is a solid pick for all the teenage lads out there. I can Imagine if you wear this to school or a party you'll more then definitely have the young Sheilas swooping your way. 10/10 for the younger blokes", "43": "Jean Paul Gaultier definitely did release a 'king of clubbing'. Ultra Male is a mix of sweet pear, vanilla, cinnamon. The scent is just so tasty and personally I find it very unisex, could be called 'Ultra Unisex'. I feel like JPG just keeps using the Le Male name to keep the sales going easier, without the need to create new adverts. Ultra Male could easily be a standalone fragrance as I do not get those Le Male vibes, not really. Those who are looking for a night-out fragrance that lasts long and garners compliments, look no further as this one works amazingly. Too bad it's getting harder to find, get it while you can (after testing it of course).", "44": "I love finding my own 'hidden gems'. I own the original JPG Le Male; like it but don't love it. When I bought Ultra Male, it was because I found the 1.4oz bottle for a surprisingly cheap price. Laugh all you want, but this is a masterpiece according to my nose. I couldn't believe it when I first sprayed it. I didn't detect a sharp, over the top sweetness that some might say is there. It smells so well put together.\n\nThe way the pear note and the cinnamon blends together is divine. It might just feature one of the best pear notes in all of fragrances. Ultra Male projects incredibly well. In comparison to the average designer scent in 2018, it is as close to 'beast mode' as you are going to get, so it is important to control how many sprays you go with. I like one spray on each shoulder (the people you pass by will get a whiff of the scent) and one spray on the back of the neck (this will leave a scent trail). As far as longevity goes, I applied some on myself at 11:15pm and could still smell it as a skin scent 11 hours later at 10:30 this morning, even after working out.\n\nWomen love this one on me, which is a major bonus in my eyes. There are rumors that this has been discontinued. One of the commenters here stated that the fragrance is being produced by Puig. My bottle is one of them. It smells great. I can't help but believe the reviewers saying that the Puig-produced fragrances have been reformulated are experiencing anosmia/good ol' olfactory fatigue. Of course, I never smelled the one produced under BPI, so you can take my words with a grain of salt, but at least heed my thoughts in regards to longevity and projection, because my bottle is definitely a performer. It is from FragranceNet. There are a ton of talks about this being discontinued; after doing a little googling, I have read a few 'members' of the fragrance industry have mentioned Puig wants to discutonue all Le Male flankers -- that is quite a big claim to me without any validation to prove it, so I'm skeptical of that, but that minor rumor makes me want to buy a big backup bottle just in case. I love this juice.", "45": "Such a soft and pleasant scent. Lovely pear and vanilla notes. Some might say it's  on the feminine side, although - to me - it does have a kind of freshness to it. Albeit not a typical fragrance freshness, but a sweet, minty vanilla freshness. Smells like sweet, delicious bubblegum. Mostly a clubbing and winter/fall fragrance.\n\nScent: 10/10\nUniqueness: 8/10\nVersatility: 6/10\nLongevity: 9/10\nProjection: 8/10\n\nLovely, playful scent with an amazing opening.", "46": "Can defiantly feel the resembelence to original Le Male, I don't see much similarity between this and Invictus tho. This is quite different to Le Male but still different enough to warrant a purchase. I'm not much good on notes but what I can say is this smells amazing and has very good staying power also. My new signature scent!", "47": "Jean Paul Gaultier Ultra Male EDT opens with a moderate to strong projection of very sweet, fruity, citrus, and spicy notes. The opening is bold, delectable, unique, and intense. The pear, vanilla, cinnamon, clary sage, mint, and bergamot are the opening prominent notes. The bergamot and lemon are brief opening notes, the create a sparkly citrus accord that is short-lived. The pear is a fruity, sweet, and juicy note that dominates the fragrance; it blends closely with the vanilla which adds a very sweet, cozy, comforting, and aromatic note. Both, the pear and vanilla create a gourmand, fruity, and delectable accord that gives the fragrance a unique character. Balancing these notes are the cinnamon, clary sage, and caraway; the cinnamon is the most prominent, but the leathery nuance of the clary sage is noticeable. These notes create a sweet, very warm, spicy, delectable, and leather-like accord. The second group of notes is two steps behind, the mint, lavender, patchouli, and cedar are part of this group, they add a green fresh cooling, and woody accord. As the fragrance moves toward the amber develops and takes a position close to the vanilla, it creates a dry, sweet, and resinous touch. The fragrance a subtle but noticeable opening to dry down change. The opening has a prominent fresh, citrus, and sour accord resulting from the bergamot and lemon that gives the opening an intense, and sharp character, at this point the pear feels moist, fruity sweet, and delectable. Gradually these two notes take one step down, the citruses disappear almost entirely, but the pear survives under the fast climbing dry down notes. As time passes, the cinnamon, vanilla, amber, and clary sage introduce their sweet, fruity, spicy, leathery, and delectable accords taking the lead of the fragrance. Once Jean Paul Gaultier Ultra Male EDT has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized, as a moderate to a strong projection, very sweet, vanilla, spicy, cinnamon, leather-like, clary sage, pear, and resinous fragrance with green, and woody accords.

Or is it? \nThere has been so much chatter about this online. Most of it is regarding it's similarity to Aventus. \nI've now had a bottle for a weeks time, and am ready to give my input. \nFirst off, yes it is similar to Aventus. 90% or so. Like Panama Daytona 10, this one shares that same combo of fruits and woods. Where Daytona is fresher, Explorer attempts to be smokier and adds an amber-y aspect. \nI've read the notes list for this, and must admit they don't make much sense.  \nThis is basically a pineapple/fruity accord, married to incense and ambroxan. \nIt comes across as 80% Aventus with 20% Sauvage mixed in. \nOn paper that might sound boring, but in reality it's a stunning combination. \nMont Blanc really understood what makes Aventus work for so many people, and managed to create a homage scent, that still has it's separate identity. \nUnlike Aventus, Explorer is much more understated. Aventus can, to my nose, come across as vulgar. It's the scent equivalent of a gold Rolex.  \nExplorer is a quieter companion. It achieves the same vibe, whilst fitting in with the Mont Blanc brand. There is a sense of class to this, that I haven't found in other Aventus clones. Maybe it's the addition of ambroxan, that sets this one apart. \nWhatever they did, I salute them. Explorer is a hell of fragrance, and not just another Aventus clone. It sits squarely between Aventus and Sauvage, and uses the best of both, whilst ignoring the bad parts.  \nGreat job, Mont Blanc. \nLongevity is quite good - 8-9 hours. \nRating: 7.5/10", "2": "Some people will tell you that Montblanc Explorer is a clone of Creed Aventus. There's some truth to that, but personally, I think it is simply Olivier Pescheux's take/variation on Aventus without really attempting to clone it. Does it actually smell like it? Kind of. The vibe is very similar, but some things are changed here: instead of that intense, fruity pineapple you get a drier, fresher bergamot. Instead of that famous birch \"smoke,\" there's vetiver smoke. You get the idea.  \nMontblanc's fragrance is a (much) cheaper and more synthetic product, but there are some obvious positives as well: Explorer smells more fresh and as such it's a much more versatile fragrance. Winter or summer, day or night, office or coffee shop... it doesn't matter one bit. It's one of those \"dumb reach\" fragrances when you're not sure what else to wear. In fact, I am wearing it at home while writing this review. Another thing to keep is mind is that Explorer does have the modern Ambroxan-like component (I think it's actually Ambrofix) in the base, which makes it slightly similar to Sauvage as well. But its Ambrofix is not nearly as loud - or as some people would say, obnoxious (!) as Dior's.  \nThe longevity of this fragrance is OK, the projection is also fine, but nothing to write home about. Some people think it does not last at all, because they go anosmic to it. But several hours later, it's still there. Since Explorer is cheap (you can get 100ml for under $60 these days) you may want to carry a small decant and refresh during the day. Other than that... the bottle looks and feels great (it's very grippy), Montblanc's \"Emblem\" logo is cleverly used, the sprayer is solid... I mean, the presentation is definitely above average. \nNow, I know some guys are wondering if they should get this or CdNIM; It's really about what you're after: Explorer is less loud and more classy, and it's more fresh and versatile as well; citrusy and slightly spicy, but not too smoky. Armaf isn't a bad option either, really, but it has a much more aggressive opening and lasts longer. \nIn conclusion: if Creed was a designer company such as Prada, for example, they'd have Aventus, \"Aventus Azur,\" \"Aventus Intense\" and \"Aventus Sport\" in the same lineup. That \"Aventus Sport\"? That's basically Montblanc Explorer. Everything considered - scent, versatility, price... 9/10.", "3": "sounds interesting with those notes but sadly many will start voting for it without even sniffing it lol", "4": "Welcome to planet Sauventus. \nFor those of us that either refuse or can't afford to pay \u00a3250 on a fragrance but enjoy the DNA of Aventus, then this is a more subtle and refined version adding a generous sprinkle of Ambroxan into the mix that for a self confessed ambroxaholic like myself, creating an appealing fragrance. \nThere will be masses of folk that have never experienced or owned Aventus due to its cost and explorer will affordably introduce them into the world of Creed with this excellent and well blended interpretation thats bringing together two of the most recognisable and popular fragrance DNA's out there in Creed Aventus & Ambroxan fragrances like Dior Sauvage and I for one am delighted these two worlds have finally collided. \nWith a realistic freshly squeezed lemon opening, fruity and subtle smokey dry down with an excellent Ambroxan base, makes this a very pleasant fragrance. \nIt doesn't spray out much juice, so double or treble up your sprays, then the longevity is excellent. \nNo cure for me then.", "5": "This just in....\"Mont blanc explorer gets crowned the new king of aventus creed clones\"\n\n No joke. The dry down of this smells pretty much 99.9% aventus. I'm a proud owner of Aventus and how closely this resembles it actually annoys me.\n\n Ok, nothing can beat the opening of aventus but this is the closest anyone has got so far. Seriously, if you love Aventus but don't want to fork out for it....Right here. \n\nI myself will be getting a bottle of this to replace my aventus once it's time is up, as the resembelence is that close. Forget club de nuit. \n\nThis is what to get.", "6": "A year after its release, Explorer has hit my local discounters. My 100 mL bottle reviewed at just 70 AUD.\n\nThe opening is very fresh indeed - zest, fruits and greenery with mint. There is an ozonic sparkle which lasts much beyond the opening. Apart from the bergamot, the fruits are not well defined. The impression is of chilled, dry champaign. \n\nWoods and earth begin to build. \nInitially, the image is of the temperate forests of the north - soft woods (cedar, birch, pine), mild camphor, a slight smokiness. The airiness of the opening remains, enhancing the woods, almost mint like. \n\nThe woods become earthier and spicier as time goes on, with amber becoming more prominent. We travel further closer to the equator, as soft woods give way to precious tropical hard woods.\n\nThe airy, woody, amber-y notes form the dry down of this very well blended EdP. \n\nOverall, a well made, modern scent with interesting captive odours from Givaudan, such as akigalawood and pomarose. On my skin, and to my nose, Explorer is wood dominant and very fresh, to the point of mint. \n\nPerformance and longevity are average for EdP. Reapplication is required after 5 to 6 hours.\n\nOverall, the Explorer is an accomplished perfume and an easy recommendation. I discern four distinct phases to this scent, all of which, whilst synthetic to my nose, are well crafted and lovely - in line with the Explorer title. This scent is masculine, versatile and appealing, with good performance, and fantastic value when the price is right. This is an easy Xmas present; many will love it, and no one will hate it. \n\nThis is, IMO, Montblanc's finest scent so far. \n\nThe average person can safely ignore the negative comments on the internet. These are largely written by folks who are so deep into the perfume hobby they can no longer be mindful when smelling, having opinions entirely based on trends and comparisons to personal favourites. \n\nP.S.\nNow, regarding the Aventus comparisons: Definitely similar if comparing the Explorer and the Aventus based off memory. The overall structuring and accords are similar. However, immediate A-B comparison reveals them to be rather different, as to be likeable to different noses. \nFirst, Aventus opens to a fruitier, juicier and fuller smell, whereas the Explorer is much more airy, dry and fresh. The dry down is more similar, yet Aventus is smoky and sweet, whereas the Explorer is peppery & camphorous.\nOverall, Aventus is more natural smelling, but loud and somewhat dirty, while Explorer is more breezy and elegant. Creed's original is not significantly better to my nose than what Interparfum/Givaudan has created for Montblanc. Both Aventus and Explorer can now be found at discounters in my country, yet Aventus is 5 times more expensive - this is something to consider for most people. \n\nI like most Creed perfumes and dislike many Montblanc ones. \n\nYet, I prefer the Explorer over Aventus.", "7": "Wow !!! Just Wow !!!\nHow in the world has Mont Blanc pulled this off ? Explorer smells EXACTLY like Creed's Aventus. I still can't believe my nose !.\n\nWhen I sprayed a shot of this juice on the back of my hand, I was not expecting anything spectular. To me the house of Mont Blanc was just a small player on the market and I have never owned any of their fragrances because I didn't like Individuel which was recommended by a famous youtube reviewer.  I didnt bother to explorer the house any further.\nSo when the lady at the perfume shop told me to smell the new one from Mont Blanc I was very sceptical. The opening smelled very generic like Carolina Herrera 212 VIP, so I thought it was another semi-sweet metrosexual  toilet water that most houses put out these days just to cash in. Walking through town minding my own business (completely forgot about the spray on my hand) when all of a sudden I was smelling something very attractive and familiar. It took my senses a couple of seconds to recognize that I was smelling Creed Aventus. Yes !! The drydown of  authentic Aventus. The famous smokey pineapple aroma. But where was it coming from ? Because I had not put on Aventus that morning. I was wearing Chanel Allure Homme.\nI brought the back of my hand to my nose and there it was. The spray of Mont Blanc Explorer was smelling 100% like Aventus. Mind  blown !!\n\nScent: 9\nLike I said before, this smells like Creed Aventus while it is made from completely different ingredients. I don't know what kind of witchcraft this is, but they pulled it off. No other clone has ever come so close to Aventus like this one. No screachy opening, no overdone note, just perfectly smooth smokey pineapple. \n\nProjection: 8\nOne spray on the back of each ear and this bad boy is projecting like crazy for 3 to 4 hours. After that it calms down but you can still smell it. \n\nLongevity: 8\nAfter 4 hours it becomes a skin scent but you  can smell it when the wind plays with your face. 8 hours later and I can still detect it  when I bring my nose to the place where I sprayed it. Even after a shower you can smell it faintly. I guess because it's a eau de parfum. \n\nOverall I think Explorer is a very nice scent with above average performance. That is what you get for $50+ (60 ml) and $70+ (100ml)\nI personally believe that this will become a massive hit because the price will make it affordable for the masses. The smell will not offend many people because it is nice and smooth. \n\nMont Blanc has hit the nail with this one. Explorer will be their cashcow and  it will add another dimension to the eternal Aventus debate. I allready have my bottle and I will buy 2 more as backup just incase this beauty gets hit by reformulation, batch issues or a madman at Mont Blanc decides to pull the plug. In my book Explorer is THE Aventus killer. Lean back and let's see how this will play out between David and Goliath.", "8": "Hah , when people wear Green Irish Tweed people think they wear Coolwater\nWhen they wear Original Santal people think they wear Individuel\nAnd now..........\n\nThey wear Aventus people will think they wear Explorer ...\nfeel bad for Creed fans , they think they wear something unique and pay 240 Euros  but it smells like a 30 euros  perfume from a chemist store", "9": "No, it doesn't smell like Aventus. It smell BETTER than Aventus!. MB-Explorer open with a Zesty Blast of Bergamont + Pink Pepper, with a heavy doze of amborxane + Patchouli + Cacao in the dry down.  \n\u2022 no PINEAPPLE sweetness\n\u2022 no Incensy drydown\n\u2022 This is NOT an Aventus, at least not on my skin\n\nI'm also getting better performance out of MB-Explorer than Aventus.  I won't buy a bottle now, but once MB-Explorer reach the discounter, I'm all over it.", "10": "Is Aventus dead? No. However, you are getting a 90% identical smell and a 95% on the dry for less than 1/5 of the price. If you need people to know that you wear Aventus then fair enough, but to the untrained nose, this will get people at a bar saying \"Oh, that smells great, what is it?\" and with the 4/5 that you have saved from buying Mont Blanc, get that person a drink and see what happens.", "11": "I am a huge fan of Aventus, but unfortunately the batch variations are absolutely ridiculous. I've owned a few bottles and now keep 3 modern batches as my favorite. Well, today I smell this on a whim (went to smell another new release) and wow, I'm surprised. I actually do not like CDNIM at all... its harsh, smells bad, and has a nasty lemon note. This... this is nice. Very nice, like a perfectly balanced modern Aventus batch. It's a keep for me. Time will tell if it will replace Aventus", "12": "Bought after testing while on holiday - definitely don't regret my decision. After owning this fragrance for roughly 5 months i've noticed a few things. \n1) It's extremely versatile - I can't really picture an occasion this wouldn't fit, it has enough 'thickness' to it for the cooler months but is not too overwhelming in summer. It also works in any scenario, from parties to office wear. \n2) It gets compliments - it's very strong, so not too many sprays are needed depending on how much you want it to project, or if you want people to notice it.\n3) I've gone through phases of loving it to liking it not so much. I've found for some periods of time i'd say its my favourite fragrance, and other times the smell just doesn't stand out to me as amazing - overall though it's great and i've never disliked it.\n\nIt's a reliable fragrance you can pick out to wear without thinking too much, it works whenever and is a crowdpleaser, would definitely recommend.", "13": "If this were the only cologne in the market would it smell\nGood...yes!  This cologne actually smells really good especially for one in the designer category and the price is not even on the high end  \nIt smells great. It\u2019s very masculine and safe at the same time. Good for office wear and everyday wear.  Has a mature vibe and it\u2019s not sweet like all these fragrances seems to be these days \nSillage and longevity are decent. You will get whiffs of it and it is an Eau De Parfum so it lasts decently. \nEveryone judging it because it MAY resemble the scent of Aventus which I personally don\u2019t think it does. I don\u2019t smell any pineapple and pineapple is not in the notes either. \nIt resembles Aventus because it uses Ambrofix. \nThere\u2019s other niche frangranses that smell exactly like other houses and nobody bats an eye. For example Parfums De Marly Godolphin a $300 bottle  smells more like Tom For Tuscan Leather or Ombr\u00e9 leather,  than Explorer smells like Aventus any day... it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nReality is that anyone who is going to own and buy Creed Aventus probably isn\u2019t going to buy Mont Blanc Explorer. And I can say that after owning and wearing a few different niche scents it\u2019s hard to spray on a designer scent. They smell harsh and don\u2019t last long. Well I can wear Mont Blanc Explorer. It\u2019s a great scent and it\u2019s really does smell nice. Smells like a manly scent and is confident.", "14": "I bought it for my hudband, all i can say- the best out of his collection so far. I am sniffing his hair, shirt, skin. I love it, it is very masculine, fhe staying power is beyond hos hopes. I loooove this one.", "15": "This is an interesting fragrance for me...\n\nFirst off, after watching dozens of reviews, I thought this would have much less of an aventus similarity. Yes, its definitely not all that close, but especially with more recent fruitier batches, the similarity is a lot stronger than i first believed. \n\nThis opens with a massive blast of super citric bergamot, and honestly, its not all that pleasant. It reminds me a little bit of the sharp lemon note in club de nuit intense man (EDT). Not the same, but it comes across in a similarly sharp way. The ambroxan, akigalawood, and pink pepper start to come through a little better after the first 15-30 minutes. To my nose, it is still overwhelmed with bergamot, but it starts to smooth out a bit. For the next 4-5 hours, this profile remains. The bergamot slowly takes a back seat, but it lasts a surprisingly long time, especially for a citrus top note. From the 4.5 or 5 to 8 hour mark, the bergamot continues to fade away as the vetiver strengthens and comes up to blend well with the akigalawood and ambroxan. Regardless of note rankings, this never transitions into an overpoweringly ambroxan-based scent. It plays a role, but is no where near as prominent as it is in sauvage (edt/edp), aqva atlantique, dylan blue, etc. and i was quite surprised by this. The ambroxan does come across in a sharpish way, similarly to its use in sauvage, but never becomes an overpoweringly prominent main note. The sharpness, in a sense, continues the bergamot vibe through the entirety of the fragrance. No, it doesnt really smell like bergamot, but the vibe and overall feel generally maintain themselves.  \n\nIn conclusion, i think there are better options out there. I get a similar scent profile with l'aventure, where explorer and l'aventure focus much more on the fruity aspects of the fragrance, along with a moderate amount of citrus. If you are looking for a fruity interpretation, go with that one. If you are looking for a woodier/smokier interpretation, go with CDNIM, as this one has nearly none of the birch note that you find in aventus, CDNIM, and even l'aventure to a lesser extent. The saving grace of this one is that i get fantastic performance. My skin, for some reason, handles fragrances in very different ways. But, for this one, i consistently get 7+ hours with a solid ~2 hours of projection. Still yet, i also get good performance from CDNIM and l'aventure (and aventus, but less so)\n\nIf you are looking for something fruitier, and more \"designer\", i strongly suggest trying out l'aventure first.\n\nScent: 6.5/10\nLongevity: 8/10\nProjection: 7/10 \nSillage: 7/10", "16": "I'm no fragrance collector, nor am I into niche perfumery, just an average guy who wants to smell nice. \n\nThis juice is really cool. It smells clean, masculine and I also dare say sophisticated. For me it would work in many occasions because it makes me feel good. It could also be due to the unsolicited compliments that I received both at work and while out with friends. It has good longevity both on skin and clothes and I think it projects quite well with a sexy trail (not a strong one though). I've already used a full bottle and I'm definitely willing to buy another one. Definitely recommend it. \n\n(I'm not quite familiar with Aventus, I just tried it a couple of times but to me both perfumes are great in their own capacity. I also find Sauvage quite harsh compared to Explorer. This is smoother and more elegant)", "17": "Finally tried this one today, and it's definitely what I'd call an Aventus variant, but not a clone. Not to wax romantic, but there is no true Aventus clone; just a lot of knock-offs and variations on the theme, some a lot better than others. And if first impressions are any indication, I'd say this is one of the better ones, in spite of the lack of either pineapple or birch in the note chart.\n\nThe opening is screechy and alcoholic for the first few seconds, unlike the original. After that, Explorer opens up quickly into something very similar to the OG - a pineapple-like accord (tho again, not in the note list), overtaken a bit by citrus, though less so than CDNI - even though CDNI claims pineapple in its notes. Pretty nice, even a minute into the experience. From there, it stays in this mid-range for a good couple of hours or more, where it gets even more Aventus-like, creamier and more blended. Fantastic mid-range for me.\n\nThe big difference in my experience is when the base takes center stage. I get a bit more patchouli than the OG, to where it's pretty noticeable. Some notes also come together in kind of a generic \"musky\" accord that reminds me of cheaper \"cologney\" scents, which I don't dig. But for me, what redeems it is the ambroxan. It's there - not quite like in Sauvage, which relies on an offset of pepper and lavender - but it's definitely there with what's left of the pineapple/citrus, imparting a freshness to Explorer's final stage. It ends up like a faded blending of Aventus and something Sauvage-ish but not quite. It's really nice overall, but it's also not Aventus, for better or worse. \n\nAll told, this is very much a \"like\" for me.  It's better in the opening than most Aventus \"clones\" like CDNI, but maybe not as good as CDNI's close, which I think really improves with time. Longevity is above average, but again less than CDNI. Explorer is very good on its own merits, but I can't say it's good enough at its current pricing. Will wait till discounters start peddling it under $50 6-12 months from now.", "18": "This fragrance started out as many others. Something, I\u2019d wear here and there. The fragrance that this was possibly inspired by is not my favorite. The whole smokey pineapple thing was just okay for me and I felt that it really is more of a musky / dry woody scent on dry down. Not really my thing. Although, I do understand the appeal. I bought many similar fragrances like L\u2019Aventure, Club De Nuit intense, and Afnan Supremacy silver. L\u2019Aventure, I don\u2019t like at all. Very woody, but too dry. Club De Nuit is very good for projection and longevity, but the quality still is lacking. Afnan smells almost just like the original, but remember, I don\u2019t really like the original *that* much. It\u2019s okay.\n\nSkip ahead to 2020 with Montblanc Explorer. This isn\u2019t my first Montblanc. I also have Individual which I also think is good and I\u2019ve worn about 1/3rd of a bottle. So not *too* bad, but not my favorite either. I started wearing Explorer back in late May 2020. I was immediately impressed by its quality in comparison to Club De Nuit. I knew that it wouldn\u2019t compete performance wise or in projection. Fine by me. \n\nBut, how does it smell? Explorer starts off with a woody, leathery, and citrusy vibe. It stays mostly like this all the way through except the citrus takes a backseat. I can smell the Cacao pods too. They give it a unique sweetness mixed with the ambroxan. The ambroxan mixed with the leather ect makes this divine. It all meshes together perfectly. I know that this isn\u2019t the best description, but honestly, this is now my *favorite* fragrance. I actually have worn it so much since May that I used an entire bottle. I\u2019m on my 2nd bottle now. No regrets at all. I would talk about all the compliments, but I have to just say that I get tons of them. Usually 1 a day at work. Somewhere along the line, I just kept on and on reaching for this one. I couldn\u2019t help myself. Sometimes my mood was telling me that I didn\u2019t want to hassle with what to wear and wanted to play it safe. Sometimes, I wanted to wear something I enjoyed a lot. Sometimes, I wanted to wear something that I knew wouldn\u2019t be too loud. Somehow, every day for awhile now, Explorer has kept up with my fragrance mood.\n\nExplorer isn\u2019t a super strong scent. It\u2019s also not a complex one, but I love it so much. It\u2019s perfection in my opinion, especially for the Montblanc prices you can pay. It\u2019s a steal. I bought 3 more bottles for $101. Yep. A few months ago, I would have made a review describing how much I love Herod. I do love Herod to death and I still wear it 1-2 times a week, but mostly I wear Explorer. I wear it at least 3 times a week and almost always on the weekends. \n\nI feel so comfortable with Explorer and I love the positive attention it garners. I get compliments from mostly women but have had some from guys too. Usually \u201cwow what are you wearing\u201d type of remark. I sometimes get 2-3 compliments in a day actually. I spray often too, because Explorer is nice in that you can get away with 10-20 sprays throughout a day. 5-6 at a time doesn\u2019t project super far and is appropriate 100%. This is probably how I used a whole bottle in a couple of months. Since it\u2019s so cheap, I see no issue with doing 5-6 sprays at a time. It smells amazing and truly embodies who I am as a person.", "19": "If there was one scent I'd have to rock for the rest of my life and I'm on a budget, it's definitely this one. Very masculine and oozes confidence. Have worn it to work, weddings and when going out partying etc. Very long lasting on clothing, but for me it becomes a skin scent after a few hours. A pretty safe blind buy if you want to smell like a professional and a confident individual. You might just nail that job interview with this one, ha!", "20": "Mix of good and bad reviews.\ntested it today & i dont agree with the claims on poor performance.\n\nIt has very good sillage/Longevity as expected with eua de parfum. On my skin it performs good 7-8h and mediocre for the last 2H\n\ncould nearly consider it as an heavy frag", "21": "I'm in two minds about fragrances that commonly get called \"clones.\" On the one hand, such scents are often much cheaper than the originals they ape, thus exposing a broader audience of casual buyers to the power of a truly great fragrance and keeping the industry from totally eating its own tail with price hikes on non-niche juices.  On the other hand, there's a lot to be said for originality, and saying a scent is better simply for being less expensive feels soulless at times.  Plus, clones are often made from much cheaper ingredients than the scents that inspire them, which raises a whole host of other issues.  Every now and then, however, a scent comes along that feels more like a remix on a well-known classic- something that stands out enough to be its own scent while taking obvious inspiration from elsewhere.  This is how we get absolute bangers like (for example) Dark Rebel; it takes Polo Black's formula and riffs on it to create something new and enjoyable.  More relevant, however, is the relationship between Explorer and Aventus, which is quite a similar story.\n\nThe thing about Aventus clones and acolytes is that it's really quite difficult to nail what makes the original Aventus so memorable and masculine.  Yes, that smoky wood and ambergris in the base is important, but so is the delicate balance of sweet and bitter that the pineapple brings across the top.  Realizing this, the fine folks at Montblanc threw this template out the window early in the planning phase and decided to build their own Aventus from the ground up.  Instead of pineapple, the top is driven by bergamot and sage, which provides the same bittersweet opening punch without having to sacrifice much in terms of nuance.  In addition, the birch wood and ambergris base that makes the Creed number truly iconic undergoes a similar reformulation. While it is a bit of a letdown to have ambroxan as the anchor note instead of proper ambergris, it makes up for it with an inspired wood blend containing vetiver, akigala, and what I would swear is some form of teak not listed among the notes.  Patchouli is also used smartly in this base to impart some of the dark, earthy smokiness that the scent loses by excluding birch wood.  It's really a masterclass in how to deconstruct and rebuild a fragrance from the studs up in a way we don't often see even with clone scents.  There's a lot of smart cost-control measures in this fragrance that keep it fairly inexpensive while maintaining a very high level of quality.  Truly a fragrance for those who love the medium.\n\nIt's not half bad on the utility front, either.  Its noncommittal approach towards the citrus in the top notes means that it's not hamstrung as a daytime or summer scent; you can wear this just about any time you like.  Its sportier nature, common to most Montblanc fragrances, means that it's reserved enough to wear in professional settings while being playful enough to impress during a night on the town.  It also hangs around for a decently long while, around 6 hours or so with a fairly conservative douse.  The slightly cheaper ingredients means it's also quite affordable compared to Aventus and most of its clones: a 50ml bottle should only run you around $50 from most online retailers, and it's pretty common to see it on sale.\n\nSome might be quick to brush Explorer off as yet another \"I Can't Believe It's Not Aventus!\" situation, but I think this one's worth your time if you don't have the cash to throw at a bottle of the real stuff.  Like Club De Nuit Intense, it keeps what makes the original so great intact with enough nuanced changes that you can appreciate it as its own scent as well, and the low price goes a long way to helping me appreciate it more.  I noticed that this scent has a marine-centric flanker as well, which I think I'll order and check out in the near future.  Who knows, maybe exploring these new horizons will turn up a fragrance that I can add to my list of all-time favorites.", "22": "(MY OPINION)\nmy favourite everyday scent at the moment. i describe it as a \"whatever\" scent. its when u dont even know what to wear and u just wear this. this covers up any situation. good dupe of Creed Aventus. i wish it can last a little longer. compared to Club De Nuit, this is less fruity and isnt musky. it is more woody and has a cardamon smell. it is more subtle and cleaner. overall 9/10", "23": "I own both Aventus and Explorer. But I must admit that Explorer is a winner and I almost can't believe that I got more compliments from Explorer. Need to sell my Aventus bottle now :(", "24": "Explorer is a banger, no denying it. With all the ridiculously poor quality control and batch variation you get with Aventus, if you wanted something in a similar fruity vein (however, not a clone as some seem to think) with a tasteful amount of ambroxan and woody notes, then this is a no brainer. Great fragrance.", "25": "For anyone talking about longevity issues\u2026I call bs. You may have just went noseblind. I wore this yesterday morning , and this smell is still loud in my truck like an air freshener. I didn\u2019t even smell it that much on myself yesterday. On another note, I have never smelled Aventus. I won\u2019t try to compare the two. I will say that this is a middle ground between sauvage edt and luna rossa carbon. It gives me that smoky, slightly citrusy, metallic ambroxan, I love from sauvage in a toned down package. It\u2019s not as screechy. It is not too toned down that it lacks in performance like carbon. It smells like a rugged and distinguished  man. 4/5 imo", "26": "You'll see a ton of reviews comparing this to Aventus (which it's kinda similar to until the dry down....Explorer gives me a little more of a fresh and peppery vibe).\nHere's the thing....it IS similar, but it's soooo much more cost efficient it's a must buy if you like this type of scent. \n100ml of Aventus is $495 on the Creed website while Explorer is $115 on the Montblanc site. \nObviously you can find them cheaper but you see where I'm going with this.  \nFor my money, a travel sprayer of Aventus works just fine and I wear that for special occasions or when I just want to feel fancy. \nExplorer is a great alternative as a similar daily wear.\nThat's my two scents.", "27": "This is the Aventus clone I've waited for. Club de Nuit Intense was much too much of a lemon pledge. Insurrection II Pure seemed promising but goes a little too birchy in its base. Brasilia (fruity batch) is nice but something is off. Montblanc Explorer is very balanced.\n\nI usually don't speak of the bottles but this is beautiful. A cyldincal glass with some leather like around it for grip. It is capped off with the Montblanc logo on both the cap and the bottom. It is simple but amazing.\n\nExplorer opens with pink pepper and bergamot and a slight pineapple accord (from the bergamot.) There is some leather from the mid too. I don't really notice the vetiver in the mid, I get leather and some juicy black currant accord  too. The base is pretty much the Akigalawood,  ambroxan and a slight Patchouli. I somewhat get some Sandalwood too, especially if I pair it with Everyman Jack Sandalwood deodorant. \n\nExplorer is a BEAST and lives up to the Aventus clones. This is the most designer of the Aventus clones I have come across and it balances that with being true to Aventus. If that makes sense. Performance is damn good for a modern day designer scent. Montblanc has put out some not so great performing designers. I get 8-10 hours from it with moderate to strong sillage.\n\nUsewise I think is all seasons. I think it really is a skeleton key scent. It might be drowned out in a club but if you are dancing with someone, you'll stand out in the crowd compared to the spicy and sweet frags that are typical for club frags.\n\nMontblanc Explorer is of the three Montblanc fragrances I own is the best. As I said it is my Aventus style scent of choice for now (I just ordered Cedrat Boise but it won't be in for several weeks.) Without this (and Cyber Monday) I dont know if I would go for the Mancera.  Explorer gets 8.6 from me and is a true love.", "28": "Yes...it is an apparent 'clone' of Aventus. They are very similar, yet it is clear that they smell distinct to one another. I smelled Explorer before I could smell Aventus. Now, I own a bottle of Explorer. I really love the scent itself. To me, I actually prefer it over Aventus. While I was able to have three 1.5 ml samples of Aventus (edp). The quality of the ingredients and the drydown is deeper than Explorer, but Explorer just smells more pleasant overall.  It feels more balanced to me, less of a metallic fruit blend than Aventus. I think it also suits younger men more so than Aventus as well. I just love the bergamont opening and the smooth drydown. This fragrance is one that I consider to be addictive for sure.\nI also have Cedrat Boise, I think that one is closer to Aventus than Explorer, and has a similar high quality and depth to it. I just find myself reaching for Mont Blanc much more than Cedrat Boise. \n\nWhile giving up on quality and performance, (Aventus lasted longer alongside Cedrat Boise), you still get a VERY high quality designer fragrance that has average performance with a much more forgiving price-point. Impossible not to recommend in my opinion.\n\nPerformance: 8/10 (6-7 hours)\nProjection: 7/10 (~1.5 hours)\nScent: 9/10 (Love)", "29": "After trying to love Aventus and failing, I tried this out and I gotta say, I prefer this over Aventus. They smell similar in the opening but Explorer remains more fruity whereas Aventus becomes harsh and smells like smoke/birch. One thing I will say is that if you smell this too close up in the opening you will get a strong alcohol smell, something you won't find in Aventus. This is what I wish Aventus smelled like but maybe not because this is so damn cheap. I can see people appreciating the smell of Aventus more because they are slightly different but you really cannot justify the price. I'd rather purchase this and Bleu de Chanel and save a couple hundred bucks...or tack on AHSEE.", "30": "Really nice, mature smelling fragrance that reminds me of a cross between sauvage and acqua di gio profumo.  I really like it, it is usable for any occasion, and I can see it becoming one of my staples.", "31": "Solid.  Sure, it is an Aventus clone. Who cares?  It lasts longer than Aventus and smells like it as well.  Is it a perfect clone?  Perhaps not, but 99.9% of people that smell it on you won't be able to tell anyway.\nOn me, it lasted 8hours plus.   Thats a pretty decent performance.  The other bonus is that it won't cost you 300 bones for a bottle of it.", "32": "I've had Aventus (a very small decant, have too many kids and not enough money to spend $400 on a bottle lol), currently own CDNIM, which I like a lot, and picked up Explorer a couple of weeks ago. I can honestly say after wearing it a number of times that it is my favorite of the 3, and quickly becoming my go-to scent. \n\nIt is very close to both Aventus and CDNIM (considering the latter is a clone of the former, that only makes sense). And while the Club de Nuit has much more projection than Explorer, it is also a much more linear fragrance - the drydown isn't that great. Explorer smells great opening, and dries down into something a little more amber-y, woodsy. I really like it. As far as the Creed goes, IMHO, Explorer makes it obsolete. I love most of Mont Blanc's scents - love Legend, and Legend Spirit is awesome - don't know why they don't get more love. But I am finding out, for me at least, that just because something ends up being sold for cheap doesn't mean it isn't great stuff. If Explorer ends up in the discount bins for $40, then I will be one happy guy!\n\nPS - I totally agree with both of @afterdark 's reviews - spot on!", "33": "I blind bought this and couldn\u2019t be happier. I have Creed Aventus and CDNIM. This smells very much like Aventus. It is not a spot on match, but it gets you in the ballpark for a fraction of the cost. It\u2019s way less aggressive than CDNIM, which in my opinion smells awful. I\u2019ll gladly sell that cheap to anyone interested because I\u2019ll never wear it. \n\nI have only worn Explorer for a couple of days and have already received numerous comments about how great I smell. I would rather wear aventus, but right now this is my everyday scent. Couldn\u2019t be happier with this blind buy! I don\u2019t know about folks that say it doesn\u2019t last long\u2026 I still smell it on my skin after an 8 hour work day and on my clothes days after wearing.", "34": "My newest blind buy. Just picked this up, been wearing it for about 3 days and really enjoying it. Would definitely recommend, and for 43 bucks it\u2019s super worth it. I previously had Club De Nuit Intense and can for sure see the similarities. IMO this is far less pungent and a lot cleaner. \n\nI\u2019ve never smelled Aventus so I can\u2019t compare. I think as far as versatility you can pretty much pull this off in most situations. Performance is above average on me. Bang for your buck is where this shines.", "35": "Projects great \nSmells great\nPrice is great\nLasts long \n\nThe more you use it the better the smell gets.\nIt is a very inviting and masculine smell.\n\nI am a very picky person in terms of buying fragrances but have to say I am glad I got the 60ml and not the 30ml haha that is all I am going to say ;)", "36": "Awesome fragrance! This is near identical to Aventus. Yes, I have a bottle of Aventus and have worn Aventus for many years. \n\nI\u2019d say 95% Aventus. \n\nDon\u2019t listen to the youtubers or the fragheads whom try to down play this", "37": "People love to hate on this fragrance. Pay them no mind. This is a top tier designer, particularly for someone who wants to get close to the \"Aventus\" scent. I own both Aventus and Explorer, and I kid you not, I receive better feedback and more \"compliments\" from Explorer than Aventus. Not to mention it's a fraction of the price, and is much more consistent batch-to-batch than Aventus. Can't go wrong with this one.", "38": "Smells like Aventus more so than PVI and CDNIM. Will buy when it hits discounters. Good stuff", "39": "Who cares about performance and longevity when you can get this for under $40? The focus on more citrusy and fruity notes as opposed to the birch and smokiness make it a winner in my opinion.

Immediately after spraying I was slightly unimpressed. After about 5-10 minutes the smell was magic. I absolutely loved it and it projected for a good 3-4 hours before becoming a skin scent which on me lasted all day, and by all day I mean 15 hours later. I know people say this is a clone to Creed Aventus and honestly I have no opinion on that because I have never worn nor smelled Creed Aventus so I can only speak on this fragrance and this fragrance is fantastic!", "41": "To be honest, I am just so tired of Aventus and its clones right now and I just want something different, something original.", "42": "Received a compliment today from a complete stranger.

I can\u2019t imagine anyone who would dislike it.", "43": "A few weeks ago I purchased 30ml bottle. As people said before; the opening is clone of Aventus and drydown same with Sauvage.

I feel totally regret.", "44": "Aventus but $35 for a 100ml bottle? Sign me up. Also, people don't always get really defensive when you talk crap about this, and people don't become really toxic and insecure whenever Explorer is brought up. So yeah, what's not to love? Well, maybe you won't love the fragrance. It doesn't have great performance, it's not the most unique smell. I like it a lot. I won't do a full review yet, but spoiler alert: it's a good one!", "45": "I'd not heard anything about this back in September when I stumbled across it at Macy's. When I first smelled the atomizer (before the initial spray), I heard Aventus whisper in my ear. The sales rep immediately jumped on that as a selling point to me and I had to curb the enthusiasm, \"Excuse me, if I want Aventus, I know how to get it.\"\n\nOn it's own, this is a great release from Mont Blanc, way better than the powdery-synthetic Individuel or \"immature\" Legend. This has a masculine fresh opening with a seductive drydown (safe choice with the very noticeable use of Ambroxan). However, I think it's the masterful blend of Patchouli that gives this scent its \"magic\".\n\nI prefer my scent to be noticed when closer to someone and a couple blasts of this stuff on your pulse points work nicely when the skin gets warm (especially in cooler weather), which makes this an interesting fresh scent for the fall/winter--not something we are used to hearing in the fragrance game.\n\nIt definitely gives a masculinity and maturity after some hours on clothes, though I do just prefer it on the skin. It's still new enough where you will smell different than others and could make for a good signature scent if worn by the \"right\" individual. No denying it smells great.", "46": "Clean and versatile with good performance (for a fresh scent)!\n\nThe fragrance for the modern gentleman.\n\n*And here is a little SECRET that I discovered recently: Explorer works AMAZINGLY as a layering fragrance with other woody fragrances!

I also recently tried it on top of old school barbershop scents (Moustache original and Eau Savage) with great results, making it less \"dated\".

Soon followed by all the doors being opened to the outside, airing things out. Then, I overheard someone down the hall say, \"They must have really used some heavy-duty industrial-grade cleaner in the office last night.\"  \nAs I tried to sneak away, I got caught. \"OMG, that's you?!?\" \"That's something you sprayed on your body?!?\" I apologized, went home, and showered it off. \nTL;DR: Mancera's Red Tobacco... An incredible 9/10 fragrance that'll get you kicked out of almost any office. Whoops!", "1": "I've had my eye on Herod for quite a few months after getting a sample vial and absolutely fell in love with it. The price, however, kept me from pulling the trigger. I just couldn't figure out if I really could justify spending that much on a fragrance, even if I do love it as much as I do, an even if it was the best tobacco-based fragrance I've ever put my nose to. \nThen, I came across Red Tobacco. The moment I saw the notes and started watching the (very) limited number of proper reviews, I got super excited. Then, when I searched online to see if I could get it locally I almost fell off my chair when I saw that I could get the 120ml bottle for roughly $100.  \nI received it, and WOW, I'm speechless. I really, honestly, have no desire to own Herod anymore. They're not exactly the same, but I like RT for exactly the same reason I fell in love with Herod in the first place...that natural, cozy tobacco smell. RT lasts longer than Herod too, so that was an obvious win right there. \nRT to me has a slightly more prominent cinnamon note, but you can definitely still pick up on the vanilla. Herod was the other way around for me. \nI still can't believe how great of a fragrance this is, and for the price compared to Herod it's a no-brainer. It's my first Mancera fragrance and it definitely won't be my last. I'm now way more interested in trying out more Manceras than PDM.\nThe drydown also reminded my a hell of a lot of Carlisle.  \nFunnily enough, I sprayed this on before going to visit my parents. I sat down, and about 2 or 3 mins later (this was after about 45 mins of actually spraying it on), my mom asked \"what smells like tobacco? Like, not cigarette smoke, but just tobacco?\".\nThat right there was confirmation to me of just how authentic of a tobacco smell RT has. \nEDIT 1: yeah this is definitely, so far, my absolute favourite fragrance from Mancera for the colder weather months. It's right up there for me with Aoud Lemon Mint. \nProjects incredibly well and lasts for what seems like forever. What a fantastic value-packed fragrance. \nEDIT 2: Yup, still no regrets with this one. Lasts for ages and smells incredible. It does project quite a bit, so don't apply it too heavily. I wouldn't dare to go more than 2 sprays for indoors. \nI also get REALLY good compliments with this one. In fact, one of the most gorgeous women I've ever met gave me 2 or 3 compliments throughout the span of a few hours. There's just no denying it, Red Tobacco is an absolute superstar fragrance.", "2": "I have both this and Honey Aoud. To me this is better because it is less cloyingly sweet, even though it is still noticeably sweet. I also like that the tobacco note is fresh and light, not heavy or stale.This is the first tobacco fragrance I've ever liked and I'm a big fan of it now. Recommended!", "3": "Holy Grail. Sometimes when I feel bad I douse my inner fore arm and sniff till I pass out. It is that intoxicating and its like a show..it reveals more for about an hour...getting sweeter, intenser in some areas and mellower in others. As the tobacco dries down incense picks up and it gets warmer. Flowers bloom. There is leather and coffee.... vanilla and oud /agar appear. It gets powdery and amber. I inhale faster and deeper till intoxicated. This was and still is my first 10/10. The tobacco gets more delicious. I do not even want to sit in an airy room. I put on music and sit inside the closet so I can smell myself. I can not wear this at work. It is entirely arousing of all the senses. I have often sprayed it on my facemask. Covid 19 has caused me- no given the excuse- to spend my hard earned money on a few frags every week because I may not make it out of 2020 alive. Its been life changing.", "4": "First few minutes, this fragrance could get charged with assault. It batters your nose with an assortment of notes that are sharp and piercing, but beyond that point, once the fragrance calms down and stops throwing a tantrum, it turns into a beautifully creamy and warm scent that is a pleasure to smell. \nThe scent surrounds me with a cloud of warmth that brings a smile to my face for the entire life of the scent. \nAs I've said in another review, I love blind buying and just smelling from the box for the first time. This scent, initially felt like a bad choice, but then firmly sat in the 'Win' category. \nMy personal advice, spray this and don't be turned off by the initial moments, the fragrance just needs to settle down and then it will show its true colours, you may even grow to like the opening, which I have now.\n9/10", "5": "Mancera Red Tobacco is a stunning fragrance, that is masterfully blended, and I love each facet from the opening, to the heart, to its gorgeous drydown.  This is a masculine fragrance done right and that commands respect.  Well-done! \n\nAs with many Mancera fragrances, Red Tobacco opens aggressively as it oozes testosterone and pheromones wherever it was applied to my skin.  In the process, I am repeated whacked about the neck and shoulders with masculine waves of spices, woods, cinnamon, sweet-incense and that oud-saffron Mancera DNA that reaches-out, grabs two fists-full of chest-hair, and yanks them out by the roots.  By the roots...bloody roots, no less!  \n\nSuch an opening will leave the boys and girls withering in pain and crying tears of great sorrow as this fragrance will punch these people in the face and piss in their bowl of Wheaties.  Simply stated, Red Tobacco is not a fragrance for the faint of heart or wimps, gimps and chimps!  You have been warned...\n\nInitially I do not sense a strong tobacco accord (mainly the spices, dark-woods, sweet notes and Mancera DNA) but within a minute or two a smooth-as-silk, spiced-honey, tobacco vibe begins to emerge.  It's still aggressive. but think of Red Tobacco as being Mike Tyson sporting a dinner jacket as this stage.  If you hold your head-up confidently and don't make strange faces nor eye-contact, then you'll live to enjoy the experience.  But look directly into the eyes of Red Tobacco and you'll be spitting out your teeth like a box of Chicklets Chewing Gum.  \n\nAssuming you've kept your mouth shut and avoided making eye-contact, you may, like I did, experience momentary wafts of Pure Havane layered with Pure Malt during the first 30-minutes.  I am not saying that Red Tobacco is a Pure Havane clone (that would be silly talk) but I am saying there is a boozy, woody, spiced-honey, tobacco vibe that may trigger some of these olfactory memories. \n\nOver the next 4-6 hours this uber-masculine scent slowly, and I mean very slowly, transitions as the tobacco pushes forward along with the amber, vanilla and sandalwood making for a gorgeous creamy, spicy, woody, red tobacco scent.  This stage of the fragrance is hard to describe, but it smells spanktacular!  However, Red Tobacco has saved its very best for last...and I'll be you're dying to find-out what happens next.\n\nAter the six-hour mark, and well into the drydown, Red Tobacco transitions yet again and it now resembles the more potent, avocado sized doodads, big brother of Commme des Garcons Sequoia (dark woods, spices and a sweetness backed with oud), which is one of my favorite fragrances of all time.  \n\nPerformance of Red Tobacco is Mancera-like in that it lasts an honest 12-16 hours on my skin and projects quite well for the first 3-4 hours, and leaves a nice scent trail, but it does not border into beast mode territory on my skin.  Moreover, you will smell Red Tobacco for DAYS should you spray it on your clothes.  \n\nOverall, I feel that Red 'Sequoia' Tobacco is the best release from Mancera during 2017 and it proudly occupies a special place in my Scent Armory.  Although this is a manly-man fragrance, I am sure a strong woman could probably rock this one quite well.  As much as I personally love it, this fragrance is a definite \"Try\" because it will be way too much \"Oompfh\" for those who are into the lighter, fresher, tobacco scents.", "6": "I think this is the best perfume of Mancera. Tobacco and Vanilla sweetness in the foreground, a little fruit in the back and a bit of saffron.\nThis fragrance smells so good. I wonder if there is a tobacco perfume that smells better than this. I do not think so..\nA very high quality fragrance, very good spread and performance is great (10-12 hours)\nIt is a quality fragrance that must be looked after ...\nSmell 9/10\nSpread 8/10\nLife 9/10", "7": "Honestly, I was afraid to try Red Tobacco. So many reviews described it as harsh, abrasive, and above all potent and long-lasting. I had also tried some other Mancera fragrances and found them inconsistent--often they would smell different on me than the official descriptions or other people's reviews. But they always delivered on the potency, for better or worse, and by all accounts Red Tobacco was the strongest beast in Mancera's stable.\n\nI was sure if I tried it on, my wife and kids would move out citing a hostile living environment, my coworkers would be repulsed (and I work remotely!), and my clothes would smell of Red Tobacco for weeks.\n\nBut then I happened to see the bottle available for test during one of my rare in-person visits to a perfume shop, and tested it on a paper strip, purely out of morbid curiosity. \"What's this?\" I thought. \"Surely this isn't the Red Tobacco I've read so much about?\" It was strong, certainly, but not harsh or abrasive. It was a warm, spicy amberish scent and I came back to the paper strip repeatedly over the next several hours. No brimstone, no cough syrup. Red Tobacco wasn't the monster I thought it was.\n\nA few weeks later I ordered a decant of Jovoy Psychedelique and recklessly decided to add a sample of Red Tobacco to the order. When it came, I cautiously sprayed a single spritz on my skin and waited for Pandora's Box to open. But instead I smelled a warm, friendly patchouli. \"Wait... did I get Psychedelique instead of Red Tobacco?\" I wondered. Because it did smell a lot like that rich, earthy patchouli in Psychedelique that I knew and loved. I honestly considered the possibility of a mix-up at the decanter. But then I sprayed each on paper strips and smelled them side by side. They were definitely different, but Red Tobacco was much more similar to Psychedelique than I'd expected it to be. Surprisingly it didn't smell strongly of tobacco to me, but at this point I was afraid my nose was compromised so I asked my wife to smell both strips, without telling her what they were. She actually preferred Red Tobacco, but then was surprised to hear the name because she didn't recognize tobacco in it either.\n\nIn conclusion, I shouldn't have been afraid. Red Tobacco isn't a scary beast, it's a fantastic beast. Maybe there is some sweet pipe tobacco in the blend, but there's also patchouli, oud, vanilla, fruit and spices and the notes blend together into a very warm, comforting scent. I look forward to wearing it on chilly evenings, but out of respect for my neighbors I'm going to keep the number of sprays down to one, or two at the most. With great power comes great responsibility.", "8": "Now this is a fragrance that performs like a very expensive fragrance should.   But without the crazy price tag.   It is very reasonably priced.   Waaaay outperforms my new Ex Nihlo.  And I do love this scent.  A very interesting tobacco.  Synthetic or natural, doesn't matter.  It is still a unique scent thst doesn't smell like every other designer-department store perfume.   It smells expensive but also unique.   I think props should be given to Mancera for that!\nThis fragrance is what every other tobacco fragrance couldn't be.  And it's not similar to them.\n1 million, replica, Into the fire, Tobacco Vanille, etc etc, all very different and none of them can be like RT.   Tobacco Rouge is very nice but also different than this one.\nThis one out performs the most expensive bottles AND it smells like luxury.  I keep thinking why spend money on Creed or Clive Christian like I have been when I could just buy more Mancera's?  Their reasonable price tag makes me like them more.  It makes me want to purchase more from them.  I am so turned off with the prices being raised in the industry and the high price tags of so many scents.  It's not that I can't pay it, or that I won't.   It's just that why should I be a fool and accept that its expensive because the price tag tells me it is?  If you want me to spend like that, prove to me that it's really worth it.  Dior Oud Ispahan ok worth it.  Creed Royal Oud, not so much....I'd rather buy 5 Mancera's.", "9": "Very nice and powerful. To me, I get a menthol cherry tobacco vibe. I can detect the pear and vanilla too.\nReminds me of PDM Layton, but with added menthol. Addictive, but could be too much in warmer weather or crowded environments. A couple of sprays should be more than enough.\n9 out of 10 across the board.", "10": "Wow this stuff is a pure bliss \nsmooth and easy to wear tobacco fragrance ....\nTobacco is.

One of the top in my niche collection, I would say this is limited for colder temperatures and to my nose, this is strictly for men only. I repeat, not for the boys. However marketed as unisex, anyone can wear this to their liking so who cares if you smell like a beast but just a heads up, this scent is very polarizing. \n\n100 ml bottle is all you need for a lifetime, and one spray is all you need for a day (Ok I\u2019m exaggerating but wait, probably not). It\u2019s so freakingly strong and projects like an unimaginable monster, pounding its hairy chest while screaming right on your face. But give it a few minutes to tame down and the beast will magically  transform into \"Adonis\". I cant live without this in my fragrance arsenal.

Strangers will walk into a room I\u2019m in and say, \u201cIt smells REALLY GOOD in here!\u201d\n\nYes, it\u2019s intensely spiced cinnamon and nutmeg at the opening, but once it settles, it\u2019s Christmas on my skin... powdery cinnamon, a dust of nutmeg, a lot of soft vanilla, and loads of tasty, sticky tobacco. This is no more synthetic than half the crap coming out of Tom Ford\u2019s inordinately overpriced private blend, and it lasts longer, thanks to TF And/or Est\u00e9e Lauder reformulating or dialing down his priv\u00e9 line.", "14": "I\u2019d say even though it may seem polarizing, a big prt of that has to do with how strong it is.  My guess is most people who would like the notes but say they hate this have oversprayed, and its been overwhelming for them.  You absolutely can\u2019t wear this like a lighter fragrance, any more than a scant couple sprays- and dont spray near your face- is too much.  \n\nI enjoy this in the evening, but in order to wear it in close company, I spray my shirt in another room and let it dry before wearing it, and it still fills the house as its drying, but very pleasantly.  Would be a great outdoors scent in the cooler months for sure.  \n\nAs a side note; the biggest complaint in the fragcomm is lack of performance on fragrances, and this particular one comes out swinging and people hate it because its too strong.", "15": "My initial impression of 'Red Tobacco' - I like it. I have to admit after one wearing (need far more time and more full wearings to give an educated opinion): I am not a big fan of the opening, but after about the 30-45 minute mark, the fragrance settles down, and the somewhat harsh opening settles into a beautiful, sexy fragrance where the tobacco, amber, vanilla and musk evolve. This is definitely a nice scent....and it's pretty potent as well.", "16": "This is soooo good! This is the best tobacco scent that works for my chemistry. Better than Tobacco Vanille and Chergui to me.\n\nIt opens fruity with spice. Then the tobacco mellows it out. It doesn't get smoky like an ashtray but like bourbon vanilla that is lingering a little too long. This is a warm New Orleans night with jazz and gumbo.\n\nLove it!\n\nMediumsilage, moderate longevity", "17": "The best expression for nuclear performance in the fragcom is resembled in this scent\nThe power of this fragrance is out of this world \nIt\u2019s a similar dna to Layton by pdm although this one is a lot better\nOne of the greatest from mancera", "18": "After a few wearings, this has jumped up into my top 5 fragrances & I have over 200 In my collection.\nThis is manly, strong, powerful and smells fantastic. The tobacco just stays and stays for hours on end, along with the other ingredients jumping around that are blended with perfection. I also get vanilla kicking in during the later part of the dry down. Projection & silage are through the roof. This is more of a cold weather fragrance & a full bottle should last me a lifetime, as I only need one spray to last the whole day.\nThis is one of the best releases from the house of Mancera. I can honestly say that I prefer this to TF Tobacco Vanille, as this has the better tobacco with less vanilla smell to it and with better spices.", "19": "Currently, Red Tobacco by Mancera is my favorite tobacco fragrance. Some people say the opening is too loud and harsh, I find the opening to be my favorite part! The longevity lasts for days especially on clothing, and the sillage is room filling with anymore than 2 sprays. Red Tobacco smells spicy, a tad sweet, a bit oudy and has an overload of tobacco. It reminds me of my father taking me into a cigar shop as a child, that smell of the isolated temp controlled cigar room. Imagine if someone lit five thousand cigars on fire at the same time. Wait about five seconds, before the smoke hits, now the room smells of Red Tobacco. 10/10", "20": "My #1 Tobacco dominant fragrance. Still waiting on Franck Boclet \"Tobacco\".\n\nI had just tried Hafez 1984 a week ago. I loved the notes and blending. It smelled masculine, with a Tobacco dominant note.\nI am convinced that Hafez 1984 is a clone of Red Tobacco. Red Tobacco is better quality, with richer notes.\nHafez has a nice boozy rum note, but that's the main difference, in notes. \nRed Tobacco has a bit more fruitiness, blending and quality are 25% better; More complexity, and notes are more distinct with Red Tobac.\n\nOn to my review of Mancera Red Tobacco.\nSome have complained of the opening. There is a nice punch of a fresh, quality, medecinal Oud in the opening, along with slightly boozy dried fruits. But it's a great beginning. \nThe Tobacco is noticable in the opening, but it does intensify as the main player, when the sweetness and spicy cinnamon settle.\n\nThen I get mostly leather and Tobacco. Leather is not listed, but it may be a leathery saffron with some birch tar. It is a moist Cavendish tobacco with some tonka perhaps. The leathery Tobacco is great, and strongest in the opening-mid. Later it's more ambery/ patchouli with Tobacco. \n\nRed Tobacco is masculine. It has a nice patchouli note. I don't get much cloves, and the cinnamon is there, but nicely blended. It doesn't stand out.\nIn the dry-down it stays cozy and more woody, with still some tobacco, and hints of fruit. The vanilla never feels prominent, it just helps everything feel smooth and creamy.\n\nI did pick up a crisp green apple at one point, and some other fruitiness, peach or pear. The sweetness is not too much, and helps cut through the cold air.\nIt is not very spicy, more warm spicy. The Amber is nice, it's not dominant, and goes well with the other woods, Guaiac and sandalwood.  The nutmeg is slightly peppery, and it's a good nuance to give the fragrance an edge.\n\nThis is great out in the cold, for Winter and Fall. Solid performance, niche quality.\n\nPS:  We are getting into mid March in Baltimore.I am surprised at how well this goes in the cooler Spring time.\nIt is fresh enough, not just to be a cold Winter frag, when it shines best.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\n     God bless.     John 3:16", "21": "@shaedz This absolutely doesn't smell like \"smoked tobacco\" or anything burning. If you're wondering if it smells like someone smoking something, like a cigarette, cigar, etc... then don't worry. The tobacco here (and in 99.9% of tobacco perfumes) is a raw tobacco leaf smell. Picture moist pipe tobacco, or loose leaf black samsun Turkish leaf or something like that. It also has a lot more going on, so tobacco isn't exactly the main player. Absolutely no one will smell this on you and think, \"you smell like a smoker\". Nothing ashy or smoked about it. A bit of incense resin, anda whisper of \"smoky\" oud, but absolutely no tobacco smoke. Hope that helps!", "22": "I've always thought of this brand as a scam...one worse than Montale (he created this brand because people wanted glass bottles lol) until now!\nThis scent is really surprisingly good!

Im tired of TF TV, dont get me wrong, I love the smell, but everyone has it these days so buying something like this is a new expirience for  me!\nPrice is really good for this quality of a fragrance, longevity is a WOW factor as well, sillage is more then enough, if it was better people would smell you for the rest of their lives! \ud83d\ude02\n\nLets go to what my nose catches shell we:\n\nIt opens with tobacco and oud just behind the tobacco. Then they start to chase eachother, like in a F1 duel. Sometimes tobacco is 1st and sometimes there is oud.. After a while there is vanilla starting to kick in, as well as amber but amber is gone really fast because in the dry down only thing i can smell is vanilla if im close to my hand and patchuli with a 5% of oud if I move my head from the hand.\n\nBest date night, high class, dress up winter fragrance so far for me! If you want a niche blind buy, go for it.\nLongevity: BAM\nSillage: BUM", "25": "I now own this scent. With this fragrance, I shall also own the souls of those around me. Mwahahaha!", "26": "One of the best tobbaco fragrances. I love the smell it lasts and projects like a beast", "27": "This scent is a MESS, but what a mess it is.  It's the kind of mess you experience to only discover it is an orchestrated experience.  Red Tobacco would be gourmand, if we ate tobacco leaves.  (I'll ignore the perfumers notes and the popular observations and just roll with what I think is in there.)\n\nRT begins with a slap of strong tobacco and a package of vague spices.  The sillage seems to actually pick up power within the first minutes as the spices unravel, and you get a couple hours of extremely potent tobacco and cinnamon with incense and vanilla.  It's so strong that it fills your stomach!  Those notes dance around for a while, and as they die out the creamy vanilla lingers until it is all gone.  This is like smoking a cigar with a cinnamon stick inside, and after you get sick on cigars, you find the cigar you smoked to a nub has transformed into a gourmet piece of cheesecake, laying you to sleep.\n\nIt's warm and wintery.  Great for when the temps dive and you want some stimulation.  The longevity is about 6-8 hours for the tobacco, another 4-12 hours for the vanilla aftermath which loses major sillage.\n\nIt's like Tobacco Vanille by TF, but with some added \"yum\" and a little extra nose.  Unlike TF TV, RT doesn't kick your face when it begins; TV has a disgusting presence on initial spray, but becomes a strict tobacco-vanilla after 15 minutes.  Added bonus: RT is about 1/6th the price of TV.\n\nRATING: unrateable!  This is such a weird fragrance that some will loathe it, find it disgusting, and others will swoon.  If you like a strong scent, tobacco Parfum, and gourmand-ish performance, this will be a winner.  If you dislike any of those descriptors, this will not be one you want to waste money with.  As a lover--9+/10.", "28": "Beautiful presentation, the red bottle and black engraved cap give it a distinct look.\nI got it last night and writing this review in the morning.\nJuice inside - Oh man, What a powerhouse. From opening to drydown it's a journey sometimes not for the faint of heart as there is a lot going on while this fragrance develops, on my skin it develops into a beautiful warm smooth n sweet Amber with tobacco touch. Just 2 sprays lasted the whole night, and then some on my skin. Sprayed once on a jersey and left it overnight, now I find myself constantly sniffing that jersey for the warm cosy n beautiful smell. Reminds me somewhat of Kalemat in the opening and a hint of Sehr al Kalemat in the drydown.\nFor me it's an instant hit.\nEdit: I find myself sniffing my shirts DAYS after I've worn em and they STILL smell of this beautiful concoction.", "29": "This is my first ever review on Fragrantica so here it goes...\n\nTo me this smells like a more niche version of PDM Herod, where Herod is linear, this beast transforms.

Just clean, incisive perfection, through and through. High quality without being showy, like a well-made leather jacket or understated luxury car.\n\nI love the tobacco/patchouli/saffron/vetiver combination, and this is a sublime example of their heavenly cohesion. The spicy fruit (supposedly pear and green apple, but it reads as cherry to me) adds effervescence, with sandalwood and oud, that long-lasting powerhouse duo, underscoring the composition. It's true that it has something of a synthetic vibe, but I find it totally acceptable and even somewhat crucial to the impact of the scent overall. \n\nPerfectly unisex; it would smell good on anyone and anything. You could squirt Red Tobacco on a jug of sour milk and I\u2019d probably cuddle with it. It\u2019s strong, so spray sparingly until you get a feel for it. Very long-lasting (8-10 hours on my skin) and the sillage is great (radiates within 6 feet or so) without being a face-slapper.\n\nIt\u2019s pricey but not exorbitant, and worth every cent.

And despite knowing this is a beast I ignored all the reviews and prayed it so about 6 times before breathing in and it honestly made me feel lightheaded\ud83d\ude02 despite that I can honestly say I am in love with this it\u2019s nutty Smokey sweet tobacco and for some reason i detect the saffron in the dry down . \nI highly disagree with the comments that have said it\u2019s purely for men and men only! I find this very unisex. I am a woman and I rocked this throughout my day and got plenty of compliments from men and women asking what I was wearing \nI can\u2019t put my finger on it, but it does smell like something I\u2019ve smelled before\u2026.\nSafe blind buy ?? absolutely not! (Packs a punch)\nLongevity 10 hours +\nProjection is obnoxious \ud83d\ude00", "37": "First spray was dramatic and confusing to me. As a smoker, i wonder if tobacco is all about this perfume. I smelled just raw tobacco thats so pungent. Maybe thats what  non-smokers would smell me anytime they sit next to me. \n\nBut after awhile all other ingredients come up. That make this a beauty. My first impression was diverted immediately. A totally well blended smell in whole. \n\nA superlasting and super sillage and strong projection with fine smell that demands compliments is what the package will offer you. Superbly created.\n\nSits well with my other niche shelf. Excellent!", "38": "Uh, I heard everywhere that the initial blast was 'challenging', or 'cloying'. I fell in love on the initial blast, and never fell out of love the entire 12+ hours of this masterpiece. Instant love", "39": "\u201cWOW!\u201d That would be the word I\u2019d use if I had to describe this frag with one word. \nThis one is simply amazing. \n\nFirst, the scent is divine. It smells a LITTLE like PDM Herod with a little more sweetness and creaminess to it. I wouldn\u2019t say \u201cit smells like an ashtray.\u201d But you can DEFINITELY smell the tobacco. I never would\u2019ve thought I would love the smell of tobacco as much as I do now. Even better than PDM Herod. And I love Herod. I know that there is ZERO cherry in this fragrance. \n\nBut it kind of reminds me of a cherry car freshener. Perhaps I\u2019m just describing it wrong. But lovely nonetheless.\n\nAnd for the power... WOW! This may even trump Amouage Interlude. ONE SPRAY and it will easily last well over six hours. There is no anosmia with this. It just keeps going. If you want to dominate everyone\u2019s nose in your area. Look no further.\n\nI swore to myself that I would NEVER buy another unisex fragrance after Layton. But this one is worthy. I cannot picture a woman wearing this. Very masculine. \n\nIs it worthy of a blind buy? HELL YES! Especially for over 30 year old sophisticated men. \n\n9/10", "40": "For some reason, Mancera's Red Tobacco is almost nostalgic. \n\nThe top notes mixed with the aldehydic nature of the Oud bring me back to the typical office freshy of a workaholic dad (maybe a mixture of Bleu de Chanel and Le Male).\n\nAs the fragrance dries down I get the whiff of sweetened Yu-Gi-Oh cards when you just open the pack. Even reminds me of the \"Root Beer\" section of the scratch-and-sniffs I got from Burger King back when \"Rugrats Go Wild\" was being promoted in 2003 when I was just 6. Weird comparison, I know...\n\nThe deep drydown is apple, spices (cinammon, saffron, nutmeg), vanilla, and a tobacco accord more akin to the \"hay\" attributed to Serge Luten's Chergui - soft, earthy (papyrus-like), and effervescent.\n\nTo some extent, Red Tobacco's amorphousness lends to its polarization. Its opening is a cacophony of accords which could be mass-appealing with a narrower scope, nearly the opposite problem of Amouage's \"Interlude Man.\"\n\nTobacco isn't a real note, but a fantasy accord similar to \"Orchid\" or even \"Leather\" that the perfumer can take liberties with in creating a scent profile. Red Tobacco isn't aiming for realism like a Demeter fragrance. The tobacco here is a beautifully blended coumarin (hence, the hay smell), madagascan vanilla & vanillin, and synthetic fruity accord in the background meant to simulate the flavouring of pipe tabac.\n\nFor my nose, and on my skin, it works but if you despise it (which you most likely will if you don't love it), it will scream in your face and run down the aisles of whatever public space your in, shoving everyone in its path like an overly-caffeinated prepubescent.\n\nMy kind of frag and probably will be my signature.\n\n9/10", "41": "This is lovely! Spiced tobacco with a sweet red fruits aura. I detect cherry and cranberry... Strange that cranberry is not mentioned as a note. I guess thats why its name is \"red tobacco\" cuz of the red fruits...\n\nDespite of what ppl say about the opening, I really love it, it's strong and punchy with an oud base. And i see why people don't like it, probably cuz the oud and incense make the opening even heavier. \n\nThe opening lasts quite a long time, but after that it starts to change.\nThe cinnamon and saffron make the fragrance somehow dusty, but with vanilla sweetness and cranberry sweet and sour smell, make a nice combination with the strong tobacco note.\n\nAfter like 9 hours is a nice, vanilla-tobacco and woody scent. Very lovely, seductive.\n\nThe performance is awesome, someone told me after 7h mark \n\"it smells so nice, I smelled it on you all day long. I don't know what are you using, but it smells nice.\"\n\nP.s. at some point the fragrance gives me a quite boozy smell, probably due to tobacco", "42": "Hello Mancera fans!\n\n Just received my full bottle of Red Tobacco (ordered directly from Mancera website).\n First impression >>> 30 minutes after a full spray on my forearm >>> This is unlike anything in my collection. \n Opens up with a blast of fruit, oudh and incense, quite sharp. If I had to describe the first minutes of this, would be smokey, oudh-y fruit jam (yes, I know).\n 20 minutes in the harshness died down, it is much more smooth and creamy, with the tobacco coming through more, the sweet pipe tobacco kind. This could definitely be unisex, although on my skin it tends more on the masculine side (oudh, patchouli, saffron). On performance my prognosis is this will have good but not stellar projection, but very good longevity. Even after 30 minutes my skin is still oily from the spray (like most Manceras) so be careful spraying this on clothes as it may stain.\n                          ***\n *Disclaimer: this is a first impression review (heat of the moment), so take it with a grain of salt. I will not judge a fragrance upon just one application in one context, and neither should you. I will give this a few full wears and come back. There seems to be a lot of interest on this fragrance (among Mancera fans anyway) so I wanted to give my thoughts on it straight away.\n\n P.S.: I also received samples of Black Vanilla, Gold Aoud and Pink Roses so I might give my few words on those as well after I give each a chance.", "43": "A fragrance like Red Tobacco is so not my thing ... and yet, suddenly, it is!  Spicy, peppery, honey, deliciousness!  \n\nI find it a bit too masculine, so I layer it with either Farmacia Annunziata's Vaniglia di Madagascar or Montale's Vanille Absolu. When layered, I get a super spicy, amazing, alluring fragrance that's perfectly toned down without becoming too sweet. \n\nThe perfume is high quality and powerful. It lasts beyond 12 hours and projects almost too much. The scent never decays or morphs into something foul  like perfumes from some of the houses do. It smells as amazing--though slightly fainter--in hour 12 as it did in hour 1.\n\nWorth the money.", "44": "I tested Red Tobacco vs Carlisle head to head. Carlisle has more depth in the top notes but loses in the dry down. Have someone spray on each arm and not tell you until dry down. I\u2019m not saying one is hands down the best either but that they are so close that price definitely comes into play here. Red Tobacco by a nose!", "45": "Red Tobacco is the definition of beast mode, performance on this one is unbelievable,  10/10\n\nThe opening is oudy animalic ashtray, just DISGUSTING.  0/10\n\nBut the mid and base notes are fruity, floral, and sweet. Smells amazing. 10/10\n\nIf you can get through the opening, this is one of the best fragrances for the winter.\n\nCarlisle by PDM is very similar to this, but the opening is a lot better, actually it is quite enjoyable. In exchange, the performance on Carlisle is worse than Red Tobacco\n\nChoose your side.", "46": "Sweet tobacco cherry bomb! Filled the whole floor after 8 hours using only 2 half sprays on the back of my neck. Smelled hints of it deep into the night! 10/10", "47": "Lovely tobacco fragrance. very strong and will get you noticed smell wise. Perfect and a bang on scent for winter cold days and nights. Love it.", "48": "This is a very smoky boozy cigar scent.  Very strong and long lasting.  Smells like a very sexy drunk man smoking a cigar that you want to cozy up with on a winter night.  Or just spray it on your drunk husband or boyfriend.", "49": "The opening for me is ROUGH! If you've ever rolled your own cigarette, this starts out like opening a giant pouch of tobacco... At first I couldn't stand the opening, but, give it a minute... and suddenly I see what the buzz is about! It reminds me a lot of a more nichy alternative to Thierry Mugler Pure Havane after it dries down a bit, or moreso PdM Carlisle.\n\nThe longer it's on your skin, the better it gets, and it just lasts and lasts and lasts!\n\nThis is a one-spray scent for me most days, and when I wear it, I like to touch up with a spray of Thierry Mugler Pure Havane later in the day. They layer EXTREMELY well together!"}, "46": {"0": "Totally different than the original Donna. Just a completely different perfume in every facet. It's a sweet, sultry night time perfume. The berry notes hit you first, then vanilla and some soft subtle woody notes along with clean white floral notes. I get some bergamot too but it's barely there. I think it helps this perfume feel kind of fresh/clean and not syrupy. The tea note is very faint but it makes it interesting when first sprayed.  \nIt's a very familiar sultry berry. I feel like Bath & Body Works has released hundreds of fragrances that smell vaguely similar to this in black/dark purple packaging lol. The only thing that stands out to me is the white floral. It makes it interesting when mixed with the sweet berry and vanilla.  \nIt smells a lot like Salvatore Ferragamo Signorina Misteriosa (which I also own). I sprayed this and the Ferragamo on my two opposite wrists and it is so similar!! The berries in Roma are not as sweet as SF. The floral note is just a hair stronger in Roma too. It's still super close though, especially the drydown. If you're on the fence about this one try the Ferragamo one. Not as expensive and still does that sultry berry scent well. \nAlso, I wish people would stop comparing everything to YSL Black Opium. It's so reductive. Not everything smells like Black Opium! Please use some critical thinking skills. If you're writing reviews with just one sentence saying something smells like Black Opium it helps no one. Many of us on this site read reviews for fun too and seeing a bunch of people say over and over that something smells like YSL BO gets so old (especially when it doesn't). Just sayin' lol.", "1": "If you were expecting this to be anything like the original Donna then you will be very disappointed with Donna Born in Roma. I think that\u2019s a big part of why this got so much hate. Fortunately for me this does not smell like Donna which I did not like at all. To me, it smells halfway in between Delina and Delina Exclusif with maybe a touch of YSL Mon Paris thrown in for the sugar and berries. It\u2019s tart berries, sweet bourbon vanilla, jasmine tea, and a base of woods. The sweet tart \u201cpink\u201d girly notes over the woodsy, musky base is very reminiscent of the PDM Delinas to me. \nI rarely ever use up my samples...of hundreds I have, only my all-time favorites ever get used up all the way like Delina, Coco Blanc, Tihota, Alien Essence Absolue, and now this one. I just could not stop wanting to wear this. All day erryday. Sillage and longevity are impressive, too.  \nMy husband is a picky frag-head and rarely likes anything I try anymore but this one has never failed to elicit enthusiastic compliments from him every single time I have worn it. He said, \u201cThis perfume is you in your sundress and heels.\u201d Plus, I love the bottle so much! It\u2019s so pretty in punk with the pink bottle and the black pyramid studs in the cap. Might be my favorite bottle design of all time. I have a 3.4 oz coming in the mail now.", "2": "Y'all I bought this full retail because every time I was in-store I sampled it and loved it. If you are a fan of sweet, vanilla, woody scents, then this one is one you will probably love in your collection. This perfume is super feminine, and may seem 'basic' at first. BUT, just wait for the dry-down, and you will never want to be without it. I highly recommend this, plus the presentation is lovely. I dropped my bottle and it SLID on across my bathroom floor without a crack or scratch. Excellent quality ;)", "3": "This scent is so addictive! On the first few sprays you definetly get florals from that jasmine. But as it sits it warms up with the black currant and bourbon vanilla and is just mesmerizing. Ultra feminine.

Amazing longevity. Fantastic siliage.  \nThank you Valentino for this masterfully blended creation.", "5": "Oh my. All I have to do is pop the top and I can smell this. It makes a lot of fragrances seem so pathetic. Boozy, sparkling, sweet. My favorite accords. This smells deep, rich, bold, feminine, and vampy.

There is a fruity sweetness in the opening it\u2019s a fresh fruitiness then it morphs into the jasmine bomb and I definitely detect the same pure jasmine (grapes scent) that I smell in Alien.  Intense Jasmine but not AS intense as the Alien Jasmine. There\u2019s more notes and more going on in Born in Roma like the jasmine tea is very interesting. And the vanilla is a sophisticated vanilla not a sugary vanilla, bourbon woody vanilla like in Si. Bravo Valentino.", "8": "Oh cmon people! It's a great perfume!!!!!! Reminds me of Nicki Minaj: Pink Friday. Longevity and sillage are satisfactory as it is a light, fruity, sweet fragrance that for some reason gives off an Almond note for me, even if its not in the composition. Fragrance for any age group! My 50 year old colleague bought this for herself and it compliments her soo much, as it is refreshing and a youthful perfume! Honestly, this fragrance brings my mood up, it exhilirates positivety and happiness! Give it a try!", "9": "So much hate for a perfume \ud83e\udd7a. Well great!  more for me I just bought a full sized bottle from Macy\u2019s. I love this scent it smells very similar to lveb BUT lveb is slightly sweeter. Yes I do agree it\u2019s not a insanely unique fragrance but hey I bought it because I liked it. Smells like a sweet pear lipstick. That\u2019s all I\u2019m getting from this a sweet pear lipstick lol. When I first smelled it I did not like it. I tried it again and kept sniffing the card. It\u2019s funny when you think you don\u2019t like something and you end up loving it. As for longevity I\u2019d say it last pretty well. suitable for any weather really winter / fall and in my opinion light and fluffy enough for Spring. The bottle is unique and cute I love it . Dry down is everything.   Very flirty I\u2019d say women in their 30\u2019s and 20\u2019s can wear this no problem.", "10": "Although Born in Roma has vanilla in it, my nose picks up more of the fruit and the jasmine tea notes. It opens with black currant and the sharpness of bergamot. The pink pepper here interplays with the florals, almost taking on a peony quality. The heart is all jasmine: jasmine, jasmine sambac, and jasmine tea, which communicates really well with the bergamot mentioned earlier. You do smell the vanilla and wood notes in the dry down, giving it an almost silky texture. \n\nThis is a very sexy fragrance. It\u2019s sensual and alluring. Champagne at dinner and flirting over coffee afterward. I think it would be good for those transitional times of year when Spring is first starting to warm up or Fall is starting to cool down. I could definitely wear this on a date or some other evening event.\n\nUPDATE: I went home and tested them side-by-side. This smells close to Very Sexy Night by Victoria\u2019s Secret. Not exact dupes, but very similar. The Born in Roma performs better, though.", "11": "This is absolutely stunning, with world class lasting power and sillage. I wore this to a Friendsgiving last night and the first thing anyone said to me was, \"you smell gorgeous\". I put it on at 6:30 pm and when I left for home at 8 am the next morning my friends could still smell it. Don't be intimidated by the ultra sweetness up-front - that only lasts for about 15 minutes before it settles into a beautifully mellow fruity spicy vanilla. A little goes a long way though, so don't overdo it on application!", "12": "I got to sniff this the other day, and it's really nice. I don't understand the hate. I mean, sure it's not groundbreaking, but it's not a bad perfume at all. \n\nThe opening is tart and fresh, and I start getting the blackcurrant. The blackcurrant stays prevalent in the composition, at least on my skin. I get the fruity nuances along with vanilla and some woody notes. To me, it's a fruity-woody perfume, not a fruitchouli. I really can't pick out all the notes in this; they seem to be blended well though. Sillage is moderate but I got pretty good longevity out of it. I think it's great for fall, winter and early spring.", "13": "This is a fragrance that I keep in my collection, not because it's my favorite fragrance. I keep it because it's SO versatile. It works in every season for every occasion. If you are looking for a good all arounder that is a crowd pleaser and compliment getter, look no further! Is sweet, fruity, woody and just so pleasant. It's nothing groundbreaking, but you will smell GOOD!", "14": "It\u2019s giving, \u201cthat girl.\u201d So gorgeous, long wavy hair, fluttering lashes, bronzed skin, cute and flirtatious with shades of candied pink glossed over her nails and lips . Delicious, indulgent custardy vanilla laced with syrupy blackcurrant. It also has a soft sensation, like a cashmere jumper. Very youthful, Barbie-esque and refreshing, perhaps my recent favourite among the mass-appealing designer releases. \n\nWhat distinguishes her? Far more indulgent, complex and elegant. The blackcurrant is addictive, whilst the jasmine tea accord is also so soothing and feminine.  \nMy husband insisted that I buy it lol.", "15": "I have both this and the original Valentino Donna.\n\nThis smells almost nothing like the original to me.  This one is vanilla and berries primarily, very sweet, very pleasing, feminine, sexy.\n\nThe original is a classy leathery rosy iris with far less vanilla and zero sweetness - it has a make-up vibe which I like.\n\nBetween the two - the original is classy and mature, this one is more fun and youthful.\n\nI love both of them. <3\n\nFragrance Reviews & Hauls: My YouTube: The Simple Chic Life", "16": "I love it even tho it doesn\u2019t smell as i thought it would. Bought this thinking i would get a woody vanilla scent, as i had read from reviews. However, this is definitely not a vanilla dominant perfume to me. Rather i find it to be a very woody jasmine perfume, even in the dry down. Smelling this i wouldn\u2019t think \u201coh what a nice vanilla perfume\u201d.  Also, even if pepper is listed only as a top note, the fragrence stays spicy/peppery throughout the whole wear. \n\nNevertheless, Born in Roma has become one of my top favorite perfumes. It\u2019s very feminine and modern. Even if the perfume turns out to be nothing like my expectations, i can still love it.", "17": "I love this scent! I had passed it numerous times in the department store, not even considering sniffing it, not at all the type I thought I would buy. A fragrance reviewer on YT raved about it and she made it sound so delicious I had to go out and try it - I went back to the same perfume shop over and over and I craved it in the end! So, today I received my 100 ml. bottle and I can't stop sniffing myself. An intoxicating boozy vanilla in the dry-down, it's probably safe for most work-places and inoffensive. I know people have described it as generic etc, but to me it is intoxicating. I crave that mouth-watering bourbon vanilla now and I adore this perfume!", "18": "The opening smells like a lighter fresher Cacharel Yes I Am, they are very similar in vibe and smell. Donna Born In Roma is a bit spicy, blurry pink fruity and woodyish sweet, with a pop of bergamot peeking through from time to time. It's very smooth, bright, not bitter and not overly musky. The projection starts moderate strong then goes stronger for a while, after 1-2 hours it's more moderate soft and tone down, then after it goes softer woodier and more floral. In the later stages of the perfume I smell something like a bit of hydrogen peroxide, maybe it's skin chemistry, it's not repulsive to the point of scrub it off, but when I wear this fragrance I tend to put a complementary sweet perfume for the night (like Cacharel Yes I Am, Marc Jacobs Daisy Love Eau So Sweet...). \n\nThe longevity seems average good, it's overall an agreeable scent, fun to wear, but I don't know if I need it and if I just prefer Cacharel Yes I Am. I need to play with it more and see, but I will finish the sample easily. I haven't tried the original Donna, but I'm not a fan of patchouli and leather perfumes, so I will pass that one.", "19": "This is probably my favourite perfume at the moment. I know some people think its boring and generic but sometimes I just want to smell pretty. This is my night out perfume, although I would also wear during the day, and it's probably my most complimented one. Its boozy, fruity and warm with a hint of floral. It's a great all rounder and I would say a safe blind buy. This lasts really well on me, even after a sweaty night in a club. I would also say its a more wintery/autumn perfume but because of the florals could probably get away with wearing it in spring but it might be a bit heavy.", "20": "This was suggested to me by a sales associate after I told her I always go for sweet and/or floral scents.This was love at first sniff. It's on the sexy side of sweet, very feminine. It gives me a date night, going out in the city kind of vibe. Once it dries down, I can smell the vanilla. Lasts a very long time on my skin and clothes. I love it!", "21": "This is my perfect 10 perfume. It's silky smooth, perfect sweet, pink vanilla \ud83d\udc95 purrs on my skin beautifully, even though many call this basic I'm in love with it. This is easily a classic Signature for myself. I can get an easy 7 hours out of this and much longer with lotion. It literally feels like this perfume was made just for me! I've never experienced that with any other perfume. I wouldn't change anything about it except maybe add a hair mist, refill bottles & a larger sized lotion, a shower gel & candle \ud83d\ude06 someone said it smells very similar to dawn & fabreeze , I can totally see where they get a hint of that. It's a clean sweet silky playful sexy. I'm super impressed with the house of Valentino lately. They truly did a 10/10 on this and I also love voce viva INTENSA, perfect light almost clean silky vanilla. For me DBIR is a love love love \ud83d\udc96 \ud83e\udd70 \ud83d\udc9e\nI would LOVE to know who the perfumer was for this one and vv intensa. Anyone know??", "22": "Warm, soft and feminine! This perfume works great during cold seasons. It's not too heavy and casual enough to wear during the day. The vanilla and black currant notes are the strongest to my nose.", "23": "Oh my! I am OBSESSED with this perfume. It has quickly become among my most favorite of perfumes!\n\nTo me it is quite a unique fragrance. I personally find Valentino Donna Born in Roma to be quite fresh actually, specifically in the opening. Now this might be a con or off-putting for some, but I almost get a \"laundry detergent/fabric softener\" vibe from this....but like a very fancy high-end boutique-y laundry detergent or softener....if that makes sense; okay so my mom used to have some expensive--I want to say it was Ralph Lauren or some other designer-brand like that--detergent growing up that she would reserve for bed linens and my memories and nostalgia were instantly and directly brought back to those freshly-washed sheets of my childhood when I smelled Valentino Donna Born in Roma the first time. \n\nBUT ANYWAY I DIGRESS I love all phases of this perfume; fresh and clean (in its own unique way) at first, as it settles, it becomes warmer and subtly sexy, a little woodiness and slight spice settles in toward the 1-1.5 hour mark. Definitely attribute the warmth and sexiness to the Guaiac wood and cashmeran, and boy, that pink pepper, too. The pink pepper gives it so much depth and a subtle spice, and it sets it apart from a lot of sweeter florals to me. The bourbon vanilla, to my nose, really shines and makes its presence known completely during the dry-down, but is certainly detectable at first as well. I love the booziness of this vanilla, rather than a sweeter classic vanilla. I highly appreciate the powerhouse of three variants of jasmine, too! But yet somehow the floral notes in this are kind of in the background to me. Little whispers of jasmine peek through. The bergamot is present as well, and adds a nice, light sparkling burst. \n\nTo me this has both great longevity and silage. Seriously still smell it on my jackets days later. \n\nI am not necessarily one to have \"day\" and \"night\" fragrances so take that with a grain of salt, but I find this appropriate for any time of the day. It is a powerful, impactful perfume, but not in a heavy way that would offend during the day or in smaller office setting, for example.\n\nAll in all, I am addicted to the combination of all these notes and the beautiful complexity in which it creates!", "24": "Starts off with cotton-candy fruits. Loving that it sticks around .. I can still smell it in the drydown, even though it morphs into a fruity shampooyness. There\u2019s this really interesting dance between the fruityness and the drier, woody bourbon vanilla. One comes to the forefront for a bit, then it moves to the background and the other becomes the star of the show for a while.\n\nIf you\u2019re floral- or jasmine-averse, I still think you\u2019ll enjoy this! I don\u2019t get a lot from the florals here. \n\nAs a vanilla lover with quite a few vanilla-woody and vanilla-bourbon blends, this is unique enough to get. That fruity/shampoo-y accord blends beautifully with the bourbon vanilla. On the wishlist!", "25": "I adore this fragrance, it\u2019s so good! It has huge longevity, I can spray this at 9 am and come back home at 7 still smelling it, projection is also good. I don\u2019t know what it is about this perfume that just comforts me and makes me feel happy and pretty! It is by far one of my top favorite perfumes!", "26": "Our first date was not uplifting nor congenial. I tolerated it just a little, though the doubt crept into me that I had made a serious mistake in scrubbing it away so vigorously.\nNow I own it since I can't do without it!  \u2661\nIts molecules structure, which do not permeate my nostrils in upward motion but rather horizontally expanding, if that can make sense, reminds me a lot of Tr\u00e9sor Lanc\u00f4me, Boss The Scent and partly also Mugler Angel. Absolutely, they aren't the same scent, specially Angel differs quite a lot if not totally, similar it's just the perception I've got of them all if inhaled; though, especially in drydown, I've to admit that I feel many similarities with Tr\u00e9sor; yes it's an update of it, a modern reinterpretation. I can also sense some of The Scent top notes in the heart of this fragrance.\nBorn In Roma literally seduced me little by little, without showing off so hard, with discretion and polite refinement. Without too much sweetness. In a pleasantly sneaky way.\nI am madly in love with this new perfume to which initially I had given no chance to excel.", "27": "Male review \n\nThere are many similar concepts on the market, so it is slightly generic and not unique at all. Mon Guerlain, perfumes from Marc Jacobs, Paradoxe by Prada, Joy by Dior, Lancome perfumes and thousands of others are similar. In my opinion they share some similarities in structure and strategy of creating a formulation. This is a traditional modern French style of perfumery, avoiding the fact Valentino is an Italian brand. Linear very sweet clean formulation, very well built likable multifunctional versatile perfume. Iso E Super together with clean musks like galaxolide, ambrettolide the main character vanillin, sweet ethyl maltol create the base. It is composed with lilly of the valley raw materials that I believe give the clean feel. Hedione gives the lift. And a traditional fruit accord created on top, that gives these slightly fruity 'peach like' nuances in the opening. (gamma-decalactone) The fruit accord on the end allows vanillin to enter, then it becomes more powdery sweet slightly woody. This is primarily aroma-chemicals based with some little amounts of naturals, I believe. Very well crafted smooth perfumery.\n\nTo be simple, this is a very intense vanilla fragrance, so it suits for every girl and every woman, especially for younger ages. Perfect for everything, every occasion, impossible to dislike. Worth the money you spend on it, this is just very well constructed. Rock this well for every outfit in autumn and winter.", "28": "This is a crowd pleasing, slutty perfume(and I mean that in the most complimentary way) I do thoroughly enjoy this. The price is fair for the slightly above average performance. Projects surprisingly well, I\u2019d say a little over arms length. The sillage is above average leaving a really nice scent trail. Longevity I\u2019d say about 4-6 hours, very average for an Eau De Parfum concentration. I\u2019d say buy this, the bottle is edgy and fun, and the smell\u2026I mean you can\u2019t go wrong it is very sexy powdery/creamy jasmine with a woody base.", "29": "Opening and mid smell exactly like express love perfume. \nBase is a nice good quality vanilla scent, reminiscent of the comptoir sud pacifique vanillas.\n\nThis scent is very familiar and smells typical fruity vanilla, but it\u2019s great quality. I can tell it\u2019s an expensive perfume.", "30": "I bought this fragrance in the summer and didn't like wearing it then. I tried it again (on a cold fall day) and fell in love! This fragrance is best for fall/winter months where it's cold. The notes aren't as as overwhelming and the vanilla you smell isn't sugary but rather soothing in away. I recommend this fragrance.", "31": "This is so beautiful! She is like the best friend who you will go to talk to when you need to heal and have a friendly laugh with. Reliable. It's so feminine and easy to wear. Please don't be alarmed by the jasmine notes, while I am not a fan of jasmine in general, this is beautifully mixed and gives a casual relaxed happy feels when you apply it. Suitable for spring and summer :)", "32": "This is a gorgeous scent. Lasting power and sillage is also very good for this! I\u2019ve bought it for 3 people now and every time they spray it around me I can smell it for hours even after they\u2019ve left. Sweet and sexy fruity vanilla with some woods. If you enjoy sweet vanilla/fruity smells this won\u2019t disappoint. This is a top tier fragrance for me!", "33": "Totally worth the hype in my opinion. It is sweet without being cloying and works for a variety of settings. The projection and longevity is amazing. Gourmand lover approved", "34": "I really love this perfume. It's hard to describe what it smells like but it smells similar to Givenchy Dahlia Nectar, except less \"sparkling\". This perfume smells expensive yet on the right person can be worn on any occasion. To my nose it's a warm, sensual vanilla and fruity blend with a touch of spice. This is so nice! Almost reminds me of similar vibes to Flowerbomb. This is sexy and addicting! \n\nIf you like Flowerbomb, Givenchy, or even marc jacobs daisy Love, I recommend this!", "35": "Epitome of crowd pleasing fragrance. \nThis is predominantly Cashmeran Vanilla with the syrupy sweetness of the black currant and the welcoming warmth of the jasmine tea. The pink pepper lifts up the scent with a freshness and brings an effervescent/sparkling quality in the background which is lovely and inoffensive. Amazing longevity on clothing (last for days), sillage is moderate at first and becomes intimate after a couple of hours in my experience. Would work all year round, day or night, and for most occasions! Solid candidate for a signature scent for most women.\n\nYoung, ultra feminine, and pretty fragrance BUT nothing mind blowing like some YouTube reviews may lead you to believe. This is lovely to buy for any women you want to offer a gift to because most would appreciate it. Yes, I can see men really liking this scent on women. Quite hard to dislike. However, if you have a large perfume collection or are easily bored at the Sephora counter and you are looking for something way more interesting than the average designer this would probably come across as boring", "36": "This fragrance is a must for anyone who loves sweet, feminine, playful scents. You get the fruity, and the jasmine which gives it more of a clean scent. I love this perfume, its always one that no matter what i always come crawling back to. It smells expensive and it reminds me of the scent that you get when you walk into the beauty section of a Macy's or Nordstroms. I seriously love this. I wish it was just stronger and projected more.", "37": "Really Beautiful. I bought it for myself for Christmas. And then\u2026 I got a COVID and I lost my sense of smell. I was very sad. And\u2026When I unwrapped my presents, I didn't smell this perfume at all. But thanks to God a few days later, my sense of smell returned. \ud83d\ude0d\n(My tip for those who have lost their sense of smell is to train. Still smell something, especially eucalyptus, citrus and rose ...some oils etc) \u201cBorn in Roma \u201c is special for me  cause I remember this scent as the first ONE after my sense of smell returned. I love it. Very feminine and sensual. Lasting power is great too! My first Valentino scent but definitely not the last.", "38": "One of my top 3. It reminds me of being in a green flowy dress hiking in the woods with the love of your life. Oddly enough, I can see it being a daytime and nighttime fragrance. I can\u2019t pin-point a season on it (yet) I have to wear it more! Very peppery floral, it doesn\u2019t remind me of any fragrance I\u2019ve tried before, which is a good indicator. It\u2019s strong and pretty long-lasting.", "39": "Alright, since I see the three compared to each other so often (which is fair, they're not entirely dissimilar) I'd like to offer my breakdown of DBIR, Libre and Paradoxe.\n\nFirstly I just want to say I own or owned sample sizes of all three so I've worn them all enough times to form a proper opinion of them, as well as parse their similarities and differences. Secondly I want to own all three so depending on your stance my opinion might be beneficial to you or completely blows my credibility out of the water LOL. Either way, here we go:\n\nSIMILARITIES: to keep it basic, yes they're all fruity-floral-gourmand. Libre has that prominent lavender note as a wildcard which puts some off but overall, I think most who enjoy at least one will enjoy the other(s). Vanilla, jasmine and citrus are present in all three. Amber is present in two of the three, as is blackcurrant. \n\nDIFFERENCES: Libre leans very heavily into the florals. The vanilla and fruit/citrus are there and detectable but definitely only supporting acts. If you don't like lavender I don't think you'll get on with it. Paradoxe is the fruitiest of the bunch; the vanilla, floral and amber notes again are definitely there, but the pear makes it super sweet and sort fresh/aquatic. DBIR sort of sits between the two. It's both fruity and floral, but I also get a strong hit of the vanilla and cashmeran which gives it a very powdery quality. Again, much like Libre, if you're not a fan of powdery fragrances I don't think you'll like this.\n\nI feel like DBIR has a \"darker\" edge than the other two. Maybe the guaiac wood at play? It feels more suited to Autumn-Winter because of it, not that it'd feel overly out of place in Spring either. I do worry it's too cloying for Summer months though. If you want something more universal Paradoxe is definitely suitable to all seasons; despite the ultra fresh opening the dry down feels quite cosy thanks to the amber. Libre too can easily be used in all seasons but it'll shine brightest in Spring-Summer.\n\nAnyway, hope that was helpful to anyone stuck between some of these as choices!", "40": "Such a beautiful blend! Starts off bright and sweet but quickly turns into a woodsy vanilla. Such a unique fragrance! Also whoever is saying this doesn\u2019t project or last is lying this lasts hours on me and I get so many compliments on it", "41": "Oh my gosh. This is one of my favorite scents ever. I heard so many reviews about it that I decided I would try out. Sometimes the ones that are raved about are not my cup of tea but this one is def worth the hype. It smells amazing on its own but on my skin? I can\u2019t stop smelling my wrist. Plus it lasts forever. I\u2019m getting a bottle asap lol", "42": "Tart berry opening that settles quickly into vanilla cream on my skin. Woody drydown. Reserved this for winter/girls night out in NYC when I don't mind being sweet & boring.  Honestly liked this better in store so I kind of kicked myself for getting a gift set but it gets plenty compliments when I wear. \nToo safe for me to love.", "43": "This is a bright fruity floral ultra girly fragrance. Sweet berries with some soft tea/woody undertones. Perfect for every day wear including the office and a very safe purchase for a gift. I get about 4 hours of projection and about 7 hours of longevity where I can still smell it on my skin.", "44": "An \u201ceasy reach\u201d type fragrance - suitable for most occasions (dressed up or dressed down, day or evening), nice and pretty, not too young and not too mature.  Modern enough, but still classic.  A little bit of everything thrown together - floral, fruit, woods, sweetness, booze, vanilla.  Not anything groundbreaking, not anything particularly adventurous or daring, but versatile and pleasant.  This isn\u2019t my favorite scent of all time, but it\u2019s quickly becoming my go-to daily fragrance.", "45": "Fruity floral, on the sweet but slightly tart juicy berry side of the spectrum, with some Oriental-ish wood and vanilla base notes. \n\nIt's nice, these modern fruity florals are engineered to be likable. No fault or issue there, it is what it is. People love them and they sell well. I wear them and enjoy them too. It smells similar to so many fragrances on the market right now though. If you're really into this fragrance genre then it's something to look into. If you're interested in adding a pleasant crowd pleaser to your collection, go sample it somewhere, it's a nice one. \n\nThe amount of wood and vanilla in the base sets it a little bit apart from the pack and makes it a bit more sophisticated and mature. Drydown is more about these notes than the fruity top notes. \n\nUnfortunately (or fortunately for you maybe), the cashmeran note is quite prominent and I don't really like cashmeran. So, I won't be buying a bottle of this one.\n\nLongevity is pretty good, and the fruity top notes hold on for quite a while. Sillage is moderate at first but fades away to skin scent as the top notes disappear.  \n\nAll in all, my first impression is that it's a contemporary crowd pleaser, nice but not really unique. But definitely something you could wear with confidence in most situations. An easy pick when you want to smell nice but appropriate.", "46": "Three different jasmine notes in this, and I, a jasmine hater, love the hell out of this perfume. I\u2019m obsessed with all the other notes in this fragrance. It\u2019s just a masterful blend. The fruity, peppery top notes are so beautiful and dance so sweetly with the jasmine in this. The woods and vanilla bourbon give it its gorgeous, sophisticated depth. I find that the top notes hang around long enough for this to not get nauseatingly floral on me, thank goodness! I bought this in a two-pack with Voce Viva because I wanted VV and it seemed like a good deal for the two travel sprays. I ended up loving this one even more than Voce Viva.", "47": "I totally agree with @Kimmy: at first smell I fell in love, but less than an hour later, it was just meh. The dry down reminds me a lot of La Vie Est Belle (about 85% similar). It's nice, but not special or different enough that I feel compelled to buy it.", "48": "My latest love!  It's vanilla and blackcurrant, which has been done to death right?  Well this is such a modern take on that crowd-pleasing combination.  It's not super sweet.  There's some green in there for balance.  A refreshing water (which I think is coming from the jasmine tea) which makes it so palatable.  Think of iced tea being that interesting alternative to other super-sweet drinks.  The vanilla is dark and mature and  warm-sweet rather than sugar-sweet.", "49": "I just love this scent. I think the hands down most noticeable/favourite aspect to me is you can so easily smell the black currant\u2026 and it smells like real genuine fresh (ready to pick) ripe black currant actually smells. Not synthetic or how false fruit smells. I think wood in my scents will always be a favourite note of mine but to some it often makes a scent smell more masculine, but surprisingly not with this scent, it is still very womanly and feminine. All the different varied notes smell so fresh. It has a very real raw fresh feeling to me. I\u2019ve only had this a day as of yet but I\u2019m really thinking this will potentially be a new favourite of mine! I\u2019m wishing I\u2019d bought the 100 ml instead of the 50! Best blind buy I think I\u2019ve ever purchased! I am really looking forward to wearing this in fall and winter \u2764\ufe0f"}, "47": {"0": "I chose this for myself and wore it during the 5 years of my last relationship. Now I am forcing myself to remove unwanted memories by finding a new fragrance.I cannot find ANYTHING I love as much as this, and that turns heads+gets compliments like this=( \nIt is VERY spicy, dark, mysterious, flirty, devilish, femme fatale, \"i'm pretty but don't fuck with me or i'll stab you with my stiletto's\" \nMy ex couldn't keep his nose away from my neck, and in fact his best male friend ended up purchasing this for himself after constantly sniffing me one time we were all out on the town.  \nI've had men stop me and ask me what I was wearing many times, and have been hit on more than with any other fragrance.  \nI truly believe this is NOT for every body. Literally...i think you have to have a natural chemistry to your hormones and flesh for this to work with you. Also, it takes a very animalistic, primal, strong, sexy and aggressive person to pull this off. THIS IS VERY UNISEX in my opinion. \nPLEASE, if you have any recommendations for me and my journey onto my next signature fragrance that is similar in character to this one...let me know!", "1": "A review from a guy. \nThis stuff is intoxicating and my favorite woman's fragrance ever. There, I could stop right now but let me elaborate a little bit. \nCrystal noir is above all goddamn sensual, it's smooth, it's intimate and it feels like a modern perfume while avoiding all the heavy stuff that instantly makes a girl 20 years older scent-wise. That creamy but upscale coconut vibe on top of the sandalwood is to die for. \nMy first experience with this fragrance was when taking a flight from Delhi to Coimbatore and this exotic beautiful flight attendant was running up and down the plane to assist people with their peanuts (hehe). I was reading a book during the flight but every time she passed by I was like ... daaaaammmn, this smells so good. Normally I don't do chitchat with flight attendants as I find that really cheesy but my curiosity was killing me. So I went up to air hostess and 5 mins later I got the name of the fragrance and paid her a compliment on having good taste. \nI had far worse flight experiences. \nAnyway, back in Europe it's needless to say that I went to the first duty free shop and bought a nice bottle (EDP) of Crystal Noir for my girlfriend.Happy to report it's even more beautiful on my girlfriend! I'm not familiar with female fragrances but I've never smelled it before so to my nose it was quite unique. To be honest, I even want to wear this myself, it's that good. \nLadies, get this. Or maybe not because strangers will run you down in the street asking weird questions. \n9/10", "2": "Let me start off by saying that this has done what no other fragrance has done before - give Alien a run for its money in becoming my signature scent. \nIt is the sexiest, sultriest fragrance I was able to come across, to date. The coconut is very prominent in this, but not in a high-schooler-bodyspray type of way. The pepper and ginger mixed with the musk give mysteriousness to the exotic, tropical base. It reminds me of a nightclub, short dresses, heels, cigarettes, sticky/sweaty bodies. It's almost sluttish without smelling overpowering and cloying.  \nHow did I overlook this beauty for so long? Thank you Versace for making this gem. I own the other Crystals, and this one is, hands down, the very best. I am in love.", "3": "So I was at Target at the beginning of summer and this woman smelled so good when she passed me that I wheeled my cart around and followed her for a few aisles until she hung up her phone and addressed the creepy stalker who was sniffing her scent trail. She told me that it was the \"Versace Black Crystal or something\" and that every single time she wears it, someone compliments how good she smells. Well, I immediately bought it. When it arrived, I tried it on and immediately thought, \"Blech! Too sweet!\" And into my Dump Bin it went. \nFour days ago, I happened upon it and gave it a spray. What a difference a few months makes... especially now that the temperatures have dropped a little and the humidity isn't so thick... it's creamy and luscious, warm, just slightly spicy... I promptly moved it to my \"Preferred Fragrances\" tray on my dresser and have worn it eagerly ever since. Definite proof that you shouldn't dismiss a scent until you've tried it under a variety of conditions!", "4": "This is a stand-out scent that positively oozes sophistication. It doesn't shout to be heard - the uniqueness of the scent comes from its unusual blend of beautiful notes.  \nI find Crystal Noir perfect for work - it's very unusual, not in the least bit boring or common, but subtle and never overpowers. It comes on all coconut and woods, but the most subtle 'real' coconut you can imagine. There is a definite 'expensive spa' feel to this. The woodsy vibe runs throughout, keeping the scent on the down-low and never screechy. It makes me feel powerful, in control, put-together.  \nI get the 'noir' aspect here - it's the beautiful introvert in the room, dressed in a black sequin gown, slinking mysteriously in the background. Cool, aloof, classy as all hell.", "5": "-Reformulated EDT Review-\n\nThis fragrance is probably the only one I can think of where fresh perfume lovers and oriental perfume lovers will both be in heaven! There is the DNA of the Versace Crystal line in this which makes it fresh and aquatic with a soapy touch, but there is also the spices and perfumey heaviness of an oriental! I have to disagree with those who say that this is an evening only perfume, to me this is totally A-okay for the day even in heavy heat and humidity. The freshness, aquatic and soapy nature of this scent prevent it from becoming cloying or nausea-inducing. This scent is very nice, I love it!!\n\n-EDP Review-\n\nSo I blind bought the EDP since I love the reformulated EDT so much, I thought it would be a safe blind buy. And I was curious to see how similar or different they are. \n\nWell, the EDP smells like the opening of the reformulated EDT. I can\u2019t distinguish the notes as they are very well blended. After 30 minutes to the 2-hour mark, the reformulated EDT turns into an soapy-aquatic-tuberose-cashmeran fresh perfume, but the EDP stays in the warm-oriental-sweet-ish realm. I actually find that there is a similarity between this EDP and Mugler's Alien..\n\nPersonally, I prefer the reformulated EDT because it is more multidimensional, original and interesting than the linear EDP.", "6": "Oh Crystal Noir, it is okay that not everyone understands you\u2026. you are just so gorgeous and complicated\u2026 full of juxtapositions\u2026 so strong, so feminine, so fierce, so carefree\u2026\n\nThis was my go to work scent when I needed that boost of confidence for the big presentations. Sometimes my night out scent when I wanted to seem a little mysterious. It somehow covered all the bases for me. \n\nGardenia, coconut, musk, amber, blended so beautifully in a sexy, creamy, otherwordly potion.  Love the silage and the longevity.  High marks for both.", "7": "As of September, I started making monthly perfume trays in order to get to know the perfumes I already own even better. This is on October's tray, and now that the last days of October are coming to an end, I feel that I can give a pretty fair review on this. :)\n\nThis is outstanding. A little really does go a long way with this one. I can see how overspraying this could result is something kind of nasty. Although the notes in this perfume point to summer, I find this best fits autumn/winter. It is a warm, woody coconut that is most definitely a base-dominated fragrance. I have a little solid perfume called \"Black Coconut\" and kind of smells like this actually (it's very old). Obviously, this is much more complex and it is much more beautiful, but this is what I would expect Black Coconut to smell like. This is a dark tropical, heady fragrance. It lasts and lasts on my skin and lasts even longer on clothes. Its a great layering tool as well since it can act as a base altogether for many other fragrances. Before this month, I haven't worn it very often, but I'm thinking that might change. Beautiful and darkly delicious (in a sensual way vs. foodie way).", "8": "I tried a spritz of this at Macy's a few days ago. Right away, I knew I liked it. My husband, who is notoriously picky about perfumes, also said it was \"very pleasant\", which is a huge compliment coming from him. I couldn't stop smelling my wrist all day. It's wonderfully creamy and cozy and sexy, like a beautiful black velvet chamise. The biggest surprise, though, is when I went to put on my coat today. I kept smelling the most wonderful scent even though I wasn't wearing perfume and then it hit me...some got on the wrist of my coat! It smelled even better than when I first sprayed it! FB worthy for sure. Try it on your scarf/jacket!", "9": "Red lip, smokey eyes, black dress and leather jacket. Something is missing! Its crystal noir!\nOh this perfume...

Definitely musky and intoxicating. I get a wonderful coconut cream with a slight floral in the background from the very beginning.

CAUTION: very seductive.", "14": "I really don't know how to describe Crystal Noir to do it justice. I think it's one of those perfumes that you just have to smell for yourself. I can definitely smell the coconut, which I love. But it is not a summery type of coconut smell. Crystal Noir is warm, mysterious and sexy, without being super heavy. Just a gorgeous mixture of spices and florals that I can't identify. I think I will always have a bottle of this in my collection for the colder months. \n\nIt is perfect.", "15": "One of the most intriguing, uneasy, capricious fragrances that have crossed my way so far, from a House whose scents I\u2019ve never considered too much. \nRounded, untamed and slightly gothic, Crystal Noir seems to be conceived on contrasts but it somehow keeps its straight personality as (un?)usual floral oriental with a rather rough opening of heady cardamom and pepper, followed by a creamiest gardenia breeze that slowly leads to the amberish and musky undertones.\n\nGoing a little deeper through my review I must point out that Crystal Noir doesn\u2019t start in the best way, at least for my tastes.. I don\u2019t really fancy a pronounced use of sour spices as cardamom, and I don\u2019t particularly love black pepper in fragrances (while I tend to put it everywhere while cooking), so the first minute of this Versace\u2019s happens to smell rather weird to my nose.. not necessarily bad or unpleasant, just a non linear \u2013 a bit gloomy and \u201canxious\u201d \u2013 combination of masculine and vaguely herbal notes. I don\u2019t know how this concoction at a certain point evolves into one of the most captivating, luxurious and desirable gardenia ever. I totally agree with those reviewers who associated this fragrance to a tropical breeze: the middle stage of Crystal Noir behaves on my skin like an exotic wind that brings a subtle mist of waxy, densely fragrant white petals through the nocturnal air, with echoes of salt and sea-breeze coming from somewhere not too far. I\u2019ve tried to, as I love the note, but I can\u2019t detect any coconut in this fragrance (as many do)\u2026. rather the white, thick and milky essence of a flower that sometimes borders towards a detectable sweetness, and other times it stays quite silent and obscured, a bit soapy too. Everything in this fragrance seems to evoke the night, the mystery, the sensuality.. and when I get to the drydown the amber is undeniably there, thickening, warming and kind of intoxicating the last hours of Crystal Noir on my skin. \n\nA pretty serious bottle (the stopper is both weird and magnificent in my humble opinion), in its elegant purple nuance, captures the spirit of the juice inside the transparent dark glass: a somehow difficult fragrance, at least for someone who tends to be more into comforting and sweet fragrant stuff as myself, but one of those whose purchase I don\u2019t regret as I would always have it in my wardrobe for an inspiring occasion (possibly on summer late nights, when I think it reveals all its beauty). Longevity is stellar on me, more than one day (!!).\nHighly recommended to lovers of sparingly spicy and white floral oriental: I guess the right chemistry and personality can bring this scent to epicness\u2026", "16": "This is my signature scent. If they ever discontinue this, I will go into a deep depression and probably have to be put someplace. I want to write a love letter to Crystal Noir, it's so important to me. I think because when I first bought it, it was a really good year for me after many many bad ones. I got a bottle in the summer in Miami and it will always remind me of hot summer nights on South Beach. The coconut is amazing, the creamy gardenia, yes darling, it also smells like Coca Cola, I swear there's a note missing. I forever will be a fan of Versace just for this fragrance alone. It's like nothing else. It's sexy and alluring and I happen to know for a fact, men love this scent. \n\nBtw, I have both the edt & the Edp. For me, the Edp is like something from the Gods, its powerful and long lasting and it kinda stays the same throughout which is fine with me because I don't want this to change from the first spritz. I want the first spritz to stay on for as long as possible. The edt is lighter, not as long lasting on me.  I have the lotion & shower gels too. I wish they were stronger, but sadly they are very light. Doesn't matter, just spray the Crystal Noir and go play. ;) Ultimate night out scent. LOVE!", "17": "I've known this fragrance a long time, heard people rave about it, but never really cared  or never really had the intentions of trying it out. Until one day I was at the mall just browsing around at a NYX counter, and the SA just smells absolutely amazing! I was like shamelessly, literally (and discreetly of course) sniffing around, who on earth smells so good? Later on I realized it was this SA. Oh well okay now that I know, I turned away, took some steps and try to get on with my day, but then suddenly I just went 'NOPE!' (imagine saying that, have your fingers click and do a 180 degrees rotation in the speed of light) and turned back around and went back to that SA and went 'OMG, I'm so sorry, but you smell UH-MAY-ZING! WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?'. Then she spilled her secret that it's a Versace Chrystal Noir. I mean, as much as a perfume freak I am, never have I thought that I would ever; stop, give compliment and ask a complete stranger what perfume they're wearing.\n\nVersace Chrystal Noir is the kind of perfume that you need to feel ready for. Yep! You gotta have the guts to wear this. If not you'll probably intimidate yourself lol. Because I think this is such a grown up scent and you have to be ready with the attention you will get for rocking this perfume! It's got this oomph, potent and it's not even sweet. It's actually loud but has this introverted, still and cool kind of sexiness. Starts kinda chill and grows like a beast overtime. This is also the kind of perfume people will remember you about. Wear this wisely :)", "18": "Wow! This is beautiful! \u2764\ufe0f When it first came out, I tested it but it just wasn\u2019t for me at the time. Now, it\u2019s something I don\u2019t want to be without. You have to try this out on your skin to see Its beauty. Paper blotter will not do it justice. That was my mistake from years ago. I didn\u2019t test it on my skin. \n\nFirst off, it\u2019s a coconut floral with sweet cardamom, ginger, and pepper to spice it up. It\u2019s not tooth-ache sweet and it not overly spicy either. There\u2019s just enough to balance the two. I get some coconut but it\u2019s part of the composition rather than a main player for me. Then it becomes like a skin scent on my skin with musk, sandalwood, and amber, but it\u2019s still projecting. It\u2019s like you naturally smell this amazing and it\u2019s radiating! You will get noticed because it\u2019s intoxicating. \n\nI have the EDT and wear it for evenings during spring and summer while during the day I wear Bright Crystal or Versense. During the fall and winter, I\u2019m contemplating wearing it during the day because of that beautiful skin scent that would go good with a cashmere sweater, and have the EDP for evening wear. If the EDP is not available, I may try layering the EDT I have with Perfect Veil. \n\nSillage is good and so is longevity. Heads up, the spray can be loud at first versus the splash and a little goes a long way. One, maybe two sprays max and distribute to pulse points, but no more. For an EDT it\u2019s powerful.", "19": "peppery, creamy and coconutty gardenia, \ni imagine this is what Morticia Addams would wear while holidaying in the tropics.\n\nabsolutely heavenly.", "20": "I have the EDT version, and let me tell you, it lasts for ages. \nI love Gardenia.

I love pepper notes. \nThe sweetness is balanced with wonderful notes of sandalwood and ginger. \nThis smells like a white flower garden that went to sleep on a warm, summer night, when the flowers project a wonderful cloud of smell that stays there in the slow, hot wind. \nBut then again, it's all balanced with some heavier, slightly tart notes, to make sure it's truly noir and not too sweet. \n\nThe drydown is amazing, it smells like creamy, warm skin that has been exposed to a lot of sun during the day. It's probably the coconut, sandalwood and musk. It's very warm and very sexy. Totally memorable and unique. A great scent if you want to be seductive on that special date. \n\nI wear it out at night and any time I want to make an impression. It's great for winter, however I love it most on warm spring/summer nights. It truly does make me feel absolutely sexy. I want to be making out in that hot gardenia garden at night! Love.\n(5)", "21": "Out of this world drop dead gorgeous! Thought I ordered the EDP got the EDT instead, but oh ..my...God, is the EDT wonderful or what? Answer: YES! I haven't smelled the EDP so I have absolutely no idea whether I am missing out or not, but no matter; this perfume oozes of sensuality, sexiness, mysteriousness, and an almost yet not quite sweet, but undoubtedly ultimately sophisticated seduction with the perfect blend of it's spices, gardenia and creamy coconut, sandalwood and musk. I can't remember how the one I bought more then thirteen years ago smelled, so if it has been reformulated, I can't complain, and/or compare. I just know that Crystal Noir EDT is a HUGE love for me. The performance is amazing as well :)", "22": "I read someone describing this scent as a vampire on the beach, I wish I could credit them because they are spot-on! I have the EDT and it's beautifully blended, I get the coconut here and there but the spices envelop it and make it so much more. The gardenia adds just a touch of sweetness, it's sexy, it's mysterious, it's unique, I just love it so much and I'm happy I blind bought it.", "23": "Crystal Noir is a beautifully blended soft oriental fragrance. I have both a mini edt and a 50ml edp. The mini was part of a set and CN turned out to be my favourite of the lot. I\u2019m not able to say that it\u2019s unique but I haven\u2019t tried another perfume quite like this one. The silken gardenia is mellow rather than heady, evident as a top and middle note but in no way overpowering as typical of white florals. The ginger is subtle, blending seamlessly  with toasted coconut, sandalwood and amber. It is smooth and lush but not sweet. My first thoughts were of a musky, spicy rum cocktail.\n\nThe coconut is not as evident in the edp, not that it\u2019s particularly pronounced in the edt. Both start strong, then soften after the first hour and are long lasting but the edp can linger well into the following day. I find the cap of the mini quite charming but that doesn\u2019t translate to the larger size which is awkward and top heavy. I\u2019ve been inclined to pick it up by the cap and on a couple of occasions the bottle itself has dropped to my dressing table. Got to be more careful or I\u2019ll end up breaking something!\n\nLuxurious, rich, elegant, I agree. Tropical? hmmm\u2026 there is an association between coconut and spices with tropical places but I identify the fragrance as more classy and exotic than tropical.\n\nI have worn this to work. It consoles and warms me on miserable wet cold grey days. One spray is enough for the office, I just have to be careful not to be over enthusiastic when putting it on. A couple of extra sprays and it becomes sultry and seductive and ready for night.", "24": "Creamy coconutty gardenia at its best. Another masculine meets feminine fragrance along the style of Sensuous noir. Clean yet dirty at the same time. Rich and sensual - just screams \"smoky eyes\" - wear this with lots of eye makeup and a low neckline it just begs for it.", "25": "Is it weird for a guy to wear Versace Crystal Noir? First time I smelled VCN was on my housemate during college time. He put it on and went out, 1 or 2 hours later I went to his room to grab something and the room smelled really amazing. When he came back I asked him about it and when he showed me the bottle I was like \"why does it look feminine?\" he said coz It Is for ladies. \n\nCouple of months back I was in the perfume shop and confused \"as always\", what to buy. My friend spotted VCN and he wanted to smell it just to go back in time and enjoy the memories as his ex girlfriend used to have it. I told him don't get the wrong idea but I'm buying this gem. I don't care if its for ladies or not.\n\nThis perfume smells very sexy and very nice. In fact, I believe it is a unisex perfume. I just got the second bottle last week.", "26": "Stunning! My favourite at the moment. Strong, musky but sweet. Always complimented when I wear this. For me it's definitely an autumn/winter fragrance, maybe even spring evening. Very long lasting and stays strong throughout the day/night.", "27": "Absolutely beautiful fragrance. It's not the kind of a heavy, dark and overwhelming fragrance that one can wear only for a night out or a special occasion. Crystal Noir can also be worn during more casual activities. It's a fresh but very sexy, and romantic fragrance. The coconut note is simply irresistible.", "28": "This is a popular one among Arab women, most of my friends own a bottle and atleast half of them keep repurchasing. I always take a few spritzes when I'm at a friend's house, I honestly find the scent quite delectable even if it may not be on my most-wanted list. It's sweet but not sugary, it's spicy (I mostly get pepper and a touch of cardamom), it's also very, very creamy, and most of all it's GARDENIA!! I love gardenias! This is a seductive, fun gardenia with the right amount of class. And yes, fresh gardenia flowers do have somewhat of milky-coconut scent to them, hence why people are getting coconut when they smell this. The dry-down is slightly less sweet and gets more woodsy, but you can still smell the milky, spiced gardenias. The lasting power is really good too, lasts days on clothes and many hours on the skin. The sillage is noticeable and sensual even from a distance rather than being loud and obtrusive. It's great for most occasions and seasons too, which makes it quite versatile. I'm not surprised that this one is popular here, it's one of the rare sultry scents that wear well in warmer weather (not sweltering hot weather though lol), especially its EDT version.", "29": "I love this so much!I've been searching for a scent like this. Its so sexy and sophisticated. It's also dark and mysterious. Absolutely perfect for the evening or a night out. I think the kind of \"peppery\" mote with the soft coconut goes really well together. its great on my skin and lasts for ages!! And it has amazing sillage.", "30": "Creamy gardenia with a dash of pepper, hint of sandalwood and some ginger to give it a 'chai tea' feel. I absolutely love it and I've never come across anything like it before! To me, this fragrance is almost like an oxymoron.. It is audacious yet comforting, dark yet light, spicy yet delicate (I don't think I'm making much sense here, but I hope you get my drift). But all in all, it is one graceful, sophisticated scent oozing with sensuality and I can imagine it working really well when the weather gets colder.", "31": "Rich, dark, creamy, slightly salty, slightly coconutty and just so amazingly GOOD. I feel like a super rich, gorgeous lady, where none of the men at my mansion party can stop admiring me and following me and begging for my attention...combined with some early morning rave dancing in some european resort.  Btw my boyfriend just plain hates it. \n\nAnyhow, i got the EdT unsniffed and couldn't make up my mind on if i like it or not. It is a quite mature smell and I was not that comfortable at first to wear it in public. That changed drastically after getting the EdP, which I believe is a little creamier. Might be just a scent concentration effect.\n\nI use the EdP after the morning shower and bring the EdT with me for occasional re-spray during the day.\nYes, I like it so much I wear it for work.\n\nThe spicy smell in the beginning are maybe not my favourites but on me they don't last that long. They just blend in perfectly with the rest.\n\nIn total the perfume lasts a couple of hours on my skin, possibly longer, at least according to my boyfriend. I believe my re-spraying is just caused by nose numbness after sniffing it almost all day, and he usually comments it in the car two hours after re-spray, that it's just too much. So, the longevity would perhaps then be even longer than I think and also the sillage even more than I imagine.", "32": "WOW\n\nIt's been a very long time since I have fallen in love with something at first sniff but this I most definitely fell for.\n\nIt's opening is incredibly fresh - so fresh I consider it suitible for daywear - a delicious fall fragrance. I am immediately hit by bright and full gardenia grounded by a strong peppery scent (that'll be the pepper), I love this combination - it makes the floral smell so much more interesting and gives it depth, while still being fresh. There is a little twinge of coconot to bind the flowers and pepper to gether, giving a hint of sweetness, but not too much.\n\nI think it is one of the best \"unisex\" fragrances I have ever smelled - a perfect mix of fresh ans spicy.\n\nThe heart notes I smell are coconut and a very strong peony, at this point it becomes a lot more sweet and floral.\n\nThe dry down - or the base notes (idk im new ^^)- about 6 hours later are much more masculine/suitible for evening wear. It becomes a skin scent of amber and sandlewood tied togther by s subtle but present musk. I believe someone else mentioned finding this phase very masculine - but not unpleasant. I would agree - i WISH my bf would smell like this! I wouldn't be able to leave him alone! But he doesnt like perfume - and I love the smell so much I can't leave myself alone !(ooh - err! - no not like that :P)\n\nHonestly in this phase - like all the phases, if I could stick my whole forearm and wrist up my nostril I totally would!\n\nAnd this is where it gets a little disappointing - while longevity on this baby is excellent 7 hours + the sillage is not great (I'd say it has a maximum of a medium to soft sillage) and I NEED to smell this all day long!\n\nTo this end I bought the 90mls EDT so I can spray with impunity - it cost me a measely \u00a345 so worth it I feel.\n\nI see the perfume is still available on their site and although I havent smelled it I will probably - lets face it - definitely buy it also, on the off chance it will be discontinued. However the EDT is still very special.\n\nAll in all this is a big fat yes from me - fresh - floral - spicy and long lasting - something for everyone surely!", "33": "Dear Readers, \n\nI agree with Ms Mortazuma for I too was shocked that the house of  Versace with Donatella and her new crew made finally a fragrance that smells delighting and  possibly I would like to own. \n\nNow, how I came across this perfume, I was buying Eros and I was talking with the handsome and kind salesmen  ,we ended up talking about Blonde by Gianni Versace and how much I lament its absence and the bewitching gardenias it had, he gave me a glittery gaze and a smile and he told me that he feels I may delight in  of one of the crystal lines of Versace,despite I don't fancy Donatella's creations that didn't make  a fan of her crystal line fragrances, but me being a fair optimist, I decided to give it a try and he revealed to me Crystal Noir. \n\nWow, yes it is a very dark sensual fragrance that has character and a lot of exotic allure and sophistication , I safely say I love it  and\nI can honestly say  bravo Donatella Versace for going to rehab and channeling the striking  and fabulous energies of Versace to create this fragrance, its fabulous and on my skin this scent lasted awhile which I enjoyed a lot !. \n\nOn my skin, the gardenias and coconut were very apparent but the amber gave it that good  \"MmmmMm, come hither and follow me \"  signal and I liked that a lot and that was just a drop. \n\nAlthough I spoke with my sister about it and she tried it as well but she has her eyes on it, so out of respect I wont purchase it for myself if she chooses it to be her new signature scent  but I would admire this fragrance and I do hope it stays for a long time, this perfume is a good buy for the evening and its also office friendly but it does have a lot of presence but if you  delight in standing out exotically , then you go girl  because this is your perfume!.", "34": "Oh. My God.\n\nI am so much in love with this!\n\nOkay, so I've had a sample for WEEKS, but never tried it because, well I don't know. I guess it just never really stood out to me.\n\nLike, \"Oh look, another pretty 'noir' floral perfume in a pretty sparkly bottle. How original.\"\n\nAnd finally, tonight, I decided to try it.\n\nAnd ho... ly... crap, you guys.\n\nThis is what happens when the \"flirty, fun, feminine\" perfumes grow up.\n\nThis isn't flirty, it's seductive. The fun carefree girl grows into a radiant, mysterious, self-assured woman.\n\nAnd the votes say this isn't good for summer, but I disagree. I think the coconut really adds a beachy vibe. I can imagine a calm summer night, walking the beach with my date, just listening to the waves.", "35": "Well I really love this one. Sexy, creamy, fresh, and a little spicy. I wore this out the other night and got so many compliments from both men and women.  One guy was sniffing around like a hound dog trying to figure out who smelled so good, and when he realized it was me he told me my perfume was \"intoxicating\". I definitely pick up the gardenia and coconut, which I'm a sucker for in perfumes. I had ordered the EDP on EBay, and was accidentally sent the EDT, which the seller offered to refund $15 of the purchase price, meaning I scored a giant 3.4 oz of this for around $26, which is ridiculous. I think it smells much more expensive than what I paid for it. Amazing lasting power, easily 6+ hours, and I was getting compliments well after I had stopped getting whiffs of it myself, and good silage, too.", "36": "Dark, cold, creamy coconut-floral. Usually coconut notes make me think of cheap, beachy, overly sweet Bath&BodyWorks or Victoria Secret body sprays so it's pretty impressive that this fragrance manages to smell kind of expensive. That being said it's definitely a super bitchy fragrance- which is a good thing. Instead of a warm summery vibe, the coconut and white floral notes give the wearer an icy cold white aura. Smells like a girl who's aloof and kind of arrogant but still likes to have fun. This scent is for unfriendly club hotties on the dancefloor who seemingly never sweat.  \n\nPair with: the sound of stilettos walking on sticky floors, sleek ponytails, a purse that only holds expensive lipstick and a few loose cigarettes.", "37": "This is my favorite fragrance.  I love the peppery, spicy flowers, and the coconut is like coconut water, not at all like a heavy, sweet coconut.  The blending is just beautiful.  No particular note dominates. I just adore it.  \n\nHaving said that, I do not like this fragrance nearly as much in cold weather. It tends to be too sharp, with a harsh spiciness in the cold.  If you've found it harsh but have not tested in much in the heat, I highly recommend doing so. \n\nThis is a scent for warm, humid nights, when it really blossoms to become a dark, sexy, kind of mysterious scent.  My husband loves it, and I have gotten more compliments on this fragrance than any other I've ever owned.", "38": "To me, it smells like coconut with mint.. It is amazing, one of my best purchases. I went to a perfumery and asked for a strong perfume. The man gave me Crystal Noir and I instantly felt in love. \n\nCrystal Noir is def super intense and mysterious. A must.\n\nxx", "39": "Pepper, pepper, pepper! Super spicy. I kind of regret getting the large EDP. One tiny spray is more than enough. Luckily this settles into a lovely and dark coconut gardenia. The ginger and sandalwood are also more apparent in the drydown. Sillage and longevity are crazy intense. Could still smell the spot I sprayed to test on the arm the next morning. Definitely best for evenings and colder months. Gorgeous and elegant bottle, looks very sophisticated on my vanity.\n\nEdit: Sprayed inside my elbow to give this another go in much colder temperatures and all day I've been catching a whiff of something delicious and cozy only to remember it's me! This really pairs best with sweater weather.", "40": "This perfume screams i am a strong woman but i want you to appreciate my vulnerability. I am intense but i challenge you to make me lighthearted. I am sexually provocative, but i want you too see me as innocent. It is dark, brooding and mysterious. I imagine a fierce, husky woman wearing this scent, one who wants to appear as a delicate fragile woman. The notes in this perfume contrast and make it a contradiction, it is soft and creamy one moment, yet sharp and dark the next. It is confused, lost and wants to be found and appreciated. Strong, long lasting & perfect evening scent, for the strong, silent, misunderstood woman who wants nothing more, than to let her guard down and be seen and appreciated for who she really is.", "41": "A lady I work with gave me a ton of samples and miniatures she and her daughters don't want...a precious little mini 5ml bottle of this was included.\n\nOMG...this is the perfect way to wear coconut in the winter or at night. It smells tropical without screaming beach or suntan lotion, and is not as food-like as you would expect with the coconut in there. \n\nIt is more like a sultry night surrounded by palms and flickering tiki torches, a perfect \"honeymoon\" fragrance.\n\nI am kicking myself that I did not pick this up heavily discounted at Ross, and will have to ration myself with the mini!", "42": "I just bought a tester Versace Crystal Noir (made in Italy), the notes are written on the backside:\nTOP: Cardamon, pepper, Ginger\nHEART: Gardenia, Peony, Orange Flower\nDrydown: Abmer, Sandalwood, Musk\n\nThere was coconut as I know, but it is not mentioned.", "43": "I must give you the background of how I came across this gem. I went into Ulta to sample JPG Classique (the original one) after the rave reviews about it on here. I  had to pass by Versace Crystal Noir to get to the JPG fragrance section and she beckoned me to snag a spray, and who can say no to that gorgeous bottle.  I didn't think much of it and went to spray JPG on my other scent free arm. Fast forward 30 minutes. I am getting out of the car, the wind is blowing and wafts up the most delicious offering of the afternoon. I immediately think it is JPG, you ladies who reviewed it can make the fragrance sound mighty enticing, but no, to my surprise it is Versace Crystal Noir!  I fell in love and promptly scoured Ebay for a bottle! Now, as I am sitting here against a rainy backdrop, I am swept away by this fragrance. This is creamy, luxurious goodness. Everything blended together masterfully. Each note complimenting the next. I adore this! Although most say it is a cold weather fragrance, I find that it works well in all seasons. It is sexy, but isn't that why we women wear fragrance in the first place? This was the first fragance I wore when I was dating the man that I am now engaged to. He loved it as much I did and still does. He always leans in for neck nuzzles when I wear this one. So, ladies if you are wanting neck nuzzles and compliments this is the fragrance to wear!", "44": "I love Crystal Noir so much. It is probably my favorite going out perfume and it reminds me so much of fun dancing, drinking, party nights, memorable moment and adventures, loyal friendships. Of course this is all 100% personal and has nothing to do with the fragrance itself but I think it is important to say how a perfume makes you feel, and this one makes me feel particularly good.\n\nIncredibly good indeed! The peppery and spicy ginger opening is very addictive and unusual and as the fragrance warms up on the skin the coconut starts revealing its milky facets and suddenly I'm surrounded by a gorgeous creamy and seductive aura. The gardenia amps up the creaminess and adds a very important floral element to this woody oriental concoction. The sandalwood keeps it interesting throughout the drydown.\n\nThis lasts so much and has a beautiful radiance. And although I really do not pay attention to compliments in the sense that I do not seek for fragrances to receive them (otherwise I'd be smelling like some metallic ozonic woody mess all the time - people seem to like those ones, ugh), this one actually does gets many compliments. So many. Probably doesn't matter but still wanted to share that, may be important to some of you.", "45": "This smells beautifull sexy ,i luv the coconut in it and wearing this is attracting so many compliments.It smells gourmand and creamy it is pleasant and warm and just beautiful.it smells so nice and whenever i want a pretty, comforting smell this is the one.\n\nWith this one i am attracting many compliments, one day i came from shopping after getting a sample, smelling of it and at the underground one guy stopped me asking me what was the  perfume i had on.\nIt up lifts my mood, has a feel good vibe and it smells so beautiful the coconut, i simply just luv it.\n\nI might even make it my signature scent because i am in my element when wearing it", "46": "Either you will love it or you will hate it. This gives me very mysterious vibes. The type of girl that lets you in but also pushes you away at the same time & your afraid to go in all the way because it seems like it\u2019s going to be intense. All in a good way \ud83d\ude04. Gives me earthy night vibes, definitely a autumn/winter fragrance.", "47": "Wearing Crystal Noir gives me a feeling of swimming naked in a silver shining creamy water at a calm, warm night or laying on a secret garden in a fullmoon midnight. So creamy, so deep, so sexy....", "48": "As a man - this perfume is a must.\nits heavy, very sexy, very aromatic, mostly for the night events. very very appealing.\n\nwhen i smell - i get confused, it is one of those perfumes that makes you wanna rip your girlfriend/wife clothes and get her to bed..\n\nim seriuos - got it for my ex girlfriend, and when she used it i always told her couple hours later that i want to take her back home. it just made me stick my face to her neck.\n\n:P", "49": "I want to pour it all over me, I love it that much!!!  I think it's the most incredible perfume I've smelled, and worn, so far!  I love it!!  I adore it!!  I want to drown in it!!  I can't get enough of it!!  I never want to wear anything else - ever again!!!  It has instantly become my favourite perfume, after only one day!  Oh my!  Beautiful.  I have the edt, and I can smell all the  notes!!!  Normally I don't like coconut that much, but in this it's heavenly, because it's all blended so well.  I LOVE the cardamom!!! Oh so sweet and chocolatey and superb and creamy and the beautiful gardenia, and every beautiful thing!!!   FABULOUS.  THE MOST SUBLIME PERFUME!! And I adore the gorgeous bottle too!!"}, "48": {"0": "The bottle is stunning, what a great color, I'm in love ! The juice is gorgeous, it has a lot of similarities with the intense version, the rouge version is sweeter, like bubble gum but it doesn't smell synthetic at all, i smell the pimento leaf like a green menthol effect, it's very subtle but it gives something special to the perfume, the patchouli is less present than in the intense version, the sandalwood is really nice it adds the deepness to the perfume. The blood orange is here at the beginning but it doesn't last on my skin, the ginger stay all the time it blends well with the freshness of the pimento leaf. I think this perfume is appropriate for summer nights and fresher weather, the sillage is good and the longevity is more than good it last all day on me. \nIf you like the l'interdit line you will love this one. Successful blind buy", "1": "This\u2026 this is the perfume you NEED. This is my favourite at the moment. It\u2019s spicy, it\u2019s warm, it\u2019s perfect for the autumn months. It fills the room when you walk in. I\u2019ve had countless compliments on this perfume. I\u2019ve been stopped in the street, people have literally asked me to wait whilst they pull the perfume up on their phone just so they know they have the right one before they buy it. It\u2019s honestly just stunning. Just buy it, you\u2019ll have no regrets.", "2": "Gorgeous! I get hints of \u201cL\u2019interdit\u201dedt with \u201cRolling in love\u201d by Kilian and Dior Poison (the old purple bottle) This is the best flanker so far! It\u2019s very rich and smooth... Like the smooth creme inside a macaron. It\u2019s also extremely sweet hence macaron but the basenotes really grounds the fragrance. It smells quite expensive and a bit perfumery... I often get that with a certain type of patchouli in fragrances. Some people don\u2019t like that because they say it smells like a fragrance store but I happen to like that! A must buy for me!", "3": "As I said before, Dominique Ropion never disappoints!\nNot a fan of the previous Interdit release (2018, not the Audrey Hepburn fragrance), i must admit that this is a good perfume.\nStrong. Feminine, voluptuous, round and spicy.\nAt first spray it is totally channelling Alien (same creator!) But then it morphs into a really 'red' perfume. \nI can feel blood orange, pimento, red pepper. Yes, it's that spicy.\nThen... the tuberose. Huge like in Alien, you also get some Poison (1985) vibes. It can be headache inducing so be careful with the amount you apply!\nLots of patchouli in the drydown. You also get some mulled wine (spices plus fruit) reminiscence. \nWinter months or cold weather only, please.\nPlease be careful when spraying as this is easy to overdo and kill people sitting next.\nOverall I am impressed as this ( apparently ) flanker has a hell of a personality.\nWell done!", "4": "WOW, this perfume smells intoxicating sexy! I can't describe what it does to me but it smells so unique and different. L'interdit Rouge smell like a gingery cherry bubblegum with some minty/cinnamon undertones. I need a freakin' bottle of this! And the staying power is incredble. Some woman walked by me and told her friend: \"Do you smell bubblegum?\" So it really does smell like bubblegum but in a sexy and expensive way. In a luxurious, a very intoxicating way! Try it out. I also love the original! This is just BEAUTIFUL! I really find this scent sexy. A very sexy \"cherry\" perfume that smells more like cherry than many cherry fragrances. \nL'interdit Rouge has some similarities to Mugler Aura Sensuelle.", "5": "Smells like the type of woman who lives alone and has impeccable taste in furniture. Mature however the opening reminds me of some oddly flavored kid's toothpaste which is just the amount of fun I need in a fragrance.\n\nWhat most tempted me to try this was a girl who called it her \"vampire scent\". Maybe. It's gothic yes, but more sophisticated penthouse isolation vampire and less urban creeping blood thirsty vampire. It's rich lux velvet-everything vampire with blood funds. Just fyi. \n\nSpices aside, it's a very clean scent. Not fresh - it's more like the aftermath of a very long very busy candle lit bath. It has a creamy spicy orange quality similar to L de Lolita Lempicka.", "6": "The best from the L'Interdit line in my opinion\ud83d\udc9f. Opens warm-spicy and has a very strong resemblance to Dior Addict (I would dare to say as close to 60% similar, but Dior is more green and jasmine heavy). In the dry down you get more of the original L'Interdit, but with lots of vanilla. Even though vanilla is not listed in the notes, I do believe they have it hidden in here. I barely smell the bubble-gummy tuberose and I prefer it to be toned down.\n\nThis is much darker and sexier compared to the other flankers. The ginger and blood orange opening is really nice and gives just enough spicyness that stay present even in the dry down. \n\nLasting power is pretty good, 6-8 hours on skin/all day on clothes. It projects moderate to strong I would say, depending on weather. Perfect for cold weather (fall/winter and night time).\n____________________________\nUpdate 26/11: I now own this bottle and I do enjoy it as a fall/winter scent. It is a lovely modern take on a 90's fragrance and the tuberose is really toned down which makes it more pleasant than the other two flankers to me! \ud83d\ude0d", "7": "This is addicting!!! I can't stop wearing it. I can mostly smell the very sweet creamy tuberose, but also a beautiful note of blood orange and some warm spiciness. It's super sexy, cozy and warming during the colder months of the year. And wow, the longevity is great! It last for 12 hours on me, and i sprayed it by mistake on one of my jackets and I can still smell it!", "8": "it doesn't get any better than this. It smells so sexy and grown-up at the same time and makes me feel like a vampire. This scent is THE perfect accessoiry for an all black outfit, preferably velvet. Forever gratefull to the salesassistant who suggested it to me", "9": "FIERY! A stimulating fragrance, glamourous, provocative and a bunch of other adjectives that all mean the same thing.  Very nice addition to this line. It smells so good to me.  Not every body is going to love this fragrance - you MUST like spicy scents. I repeat - IF YOU DO NOT LIKE SPICY FRAGRANCES you will NOT like this one.  A sweet, spicy- powerhouse.  I picture Sophia Loren with an enticing long red dress - similar to the color of this bottle - with a quellazaire puffing smoke in faces of drooling men- dahling.", "10": "this is too sexy for your own good!!! For a while, I never even cared to smell this because i already owned and loved the original l'interdit - but when i finally did try it, i was met with a warm, sweet yet spicy fragrance that smells significiantly different from the original l'interdit, yet holds the same DNA. Instant buy! I'm not sure if I'll wear this during daytime though since it's a very sultry, seductive fragrance.", "11": "This is not what I expected. I thought it would be a woody scent but what I'm getting is L'interdit EDP with ginger and blood orange rather than orange blossom which is a really nice combination and smells similar to Twilly Eau Ginger but sweeter. The tuberose comes through as bubble gum as it does in all the L'interdit fragrances. I love L'interdit intense and don't find this to be too similar to that myself. This is definitely a bit fresher due to the ginger and different enough to justify having both. Will be buying a full bottle at some point. Another fantastic creation in the L'interdit line. Hopefully these flankers are here to stay because I would like to wear them for many years to come.", "12": "I am in love with this perfume. But when I look at the notes, I don\u2019t get any of them. I get something fruity and sweet, with a little spice. And call me crazy but it reminds me of Poison, the original, or those beautiful powerhouse perfumes from the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. It obviously does not smell similar, but it gives me those vintage vibes, only that have been modernized. I missed those perfumes that made a statement.

I\u2019ve had my eyes on it for a while but no local mall, Ulta or Sephora carried a tester and I REALLY wanted to smell it\u2022\n\nThis was disappointing. I\u2019ve only returned 2 fragrances in my life: this is one of them.\nSmells like soda. Root beer/coca cola/ Dr. Pepper; a creamy spice fragrance. I guess that\u2019s sexy to some people? But then again perfumes are different on everyone. Great for F/W \ud83c\udf42\u2744\ufe0f\n\nThe longevity on fabric is great, and the sillage is moderate to me.\nNot juvenile at all, great for maybe 25+. \n\nThe dry down gives off a cashmere, vanilla & woody (almost smoky) scent.

I now own the Rouge, the Intense version and the EdP, and for me they are different enough to justify all three bottles in my collection. These perfumes are class in a bottle! I see a lot of people find this one too similar to the Intense version. I don't agree: yeah, they share the same DNA, but they are three sisters with their own character, suited for different occasions. If you're not a die hard lover of the DNA, you definitely won't be needing more than one version, but if you love the original and the Intense, go and give this one a try. The Rouge is more intense than the Intense, by the way. Another commenter used the word 'voluptuous' and that is exactly what this is! Warm, round, in your face, without being screechy, but definitely more suited for Fall and Winter.", "15": "Givenchy\ud83d\udd25L'Interdit edp Rouge\nIs So Sexy, Seductive and Intoxicating!

It has a hot and spicy, peppery, dark, woody, composition; mixed with a sweet, sexy, cozy, cherry elixir type of vibe.  The fragrance comes in a sexy-sheik dark red bottle that is equally enticing!  \n\nAs much as I love this fragrance, I caution you that it is NOT a safe blind-buy.

Everyone needs to own this.", "18": "This winter, I felt like picking a \u201cwinter\u201d scent. Coco Mademoiselle has been my signature scent for years and I usually wear it year round, but this year I felt Iike I needed a change. \nI got Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s Classique as a gift from a friend for my birthday and quite enjoy that scent too. \nRecently I came across Givenchy L\u2019Interdit at Sephora and was quite confused between the three versions. I really like the original - an all-day fragrance that smelled unique. But when I sampled L\u2019Interdit Rouge on my skin, I was blown away. \nThis is a very warm, spicy, ambery scent that feels like a cosy wrap around you. It smells classy, chic and mysterious - and I love how versatile this scent really is. \nI find this perfume is like nothing else I\u2019ve ever smelled before: it\u2019s oddly calming yet takes you on a journey with all the things it reminds you of. I think of mulled wine, cozy bonfires and warm toasty jumpers every time I get a whiff. \nDefinitely recommend", "19": "Why, hello 1990's Samsara formulation.  I have missed you.  \n\nOf course people love this.  They basically took the best parts of Samsara and made them even better.  Lighter on the powder, a hair more sweetness in their top note citrus, and pushed forward the jasmine.  It is still strong and vibrant, with a gorgeous sweet and spicy sandalwood drydown on the skin- no soapiness.  It's a beautiful scent, and I have no doubt it will continue to be popular.  There's no mystery here.  Guerlain should have gone in this direction with their reformulation.  \n\nThis is rich, sexy, and apparently- timeless.", "20": "the first time i wore this i got into a car with friends and they immediately said \"omg what are you wearing you smell SO good\" and i continue to get complimented on it when i wear it! it's such a gorgeous spicy sexy feminine scent- truly one of the better new releases i have smelled lately. my new signature scent!", "21": "Nice, opening is very masculine dry drown very similar to Hugo Boss Deep Red, has the same dusky rouge smell as Deep Red but also a lovely smoky wood essence. Lovely autumn perfume", "22": "\u3030\u2734 if Dracula had a signature scent (which actually makes me a first class simp) \u2734\u3030\n\nOne of the sexiest and most unique scents I've ever smelled. The opening of the perfume is pure blood orange juice, but I won't define it as a citrusy or fruity scent. The thing that blows my mind about this fragrance is that it contains notes that I usually makes me think about freshness, such as orange and white flowers\u2026 yet, this is not a fresh scent at all: the spicy and woody undertones of pimento, sandalwood and patchouli give warmth to this mix, making it extremely deep and sensual, suitable for evening and winter.\nWhen I think of citrus, ginger, woods and spices I typically think about Christmas, but this is not the case: if there will be someone by the fireplace it will certainly not be Santa, could be a good-looking vampire instead (but forget those sparkling vampires from the Twilight saga, think about old transylvanian legends instead!). \nThis is a sexy, addictive scent, which is kind of gothic to me. Fierce, suitable for mature, sensual and confident people. To me it also seems very sweet and slightly powdery, even if it doesn't contain such notes. Really good mix of ingredients, so sad it doesn't smell as good on my skin as it does on my clothes (it loses a bit of its sweetness on me).\n\u2028The bottle design is beautiful: an ode to red, the brand's signature color. Such a jewel, to smell and to look at. Bold sillage with trail and excellent longevity, is an EDP but feels like an EDP intense, so it's a great value for money. I've noticed that it's predominantly considered a \"feminine\" fragrance, but I'd like to encourage men to don't be shy and give it a try!\n\nSettings & feelings: Candlelight dinner with Dracula in their beautiful, elegant gothic castle. In the glass a red drink, blood\u2026 orange juice, with a little ginger. The main courses are hot and spicy dishes. About the dessert\u2026 I leave to your imagination.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\nN\u2734\u3030", "23": "This is my favourite of the L\u2019interdit line. In the dead of winter this warms your whole body up. The first time I sampled it I knew there was no going back. The weeks between sampling Rouge and acquiring it were long. \n\nI enjoy the regular L\u2019interdit but sometimes the juxtaposition of the freshness and heaviness of it are just too much for me. I find the depth and warmth of Rouge intoxicating and am constantly sniffing my wrists, top, and scarf whenever I wear it. It\u2019s clearly a close relative of both the original and  the Intense but Rouge just stole my heart. The jasmine and tuberose make it very sweet but the sandalwood and vetiver balance it out and give it depth. The orange and ginger are warm and lay over the rest of the concoction for a short while. The pimento adds a warmth that pulsates through the fragrance but it never overpowers the other notes. I love everything about this. Oh and that bottle! One of the chicest and sexiest fragrance bottles.", "24": "I\u2019m amazed at how completely different each version is and how easy it is to tell the difference between one another , this has never really happened too often with flankers ! This one is so sexy and screams SEXY RED HEAD BABY with that ginger nip", "25": "I completely agree with blake.lee's comment on this perfume. It's a 'modern' version of classic perfumes like Opium. \nVery spicy, earthy, as well as sweet (the incense-type-sweetness).\n\nI get the most spicy scent in the beginning, after some time it evolves in to the woody/earthy type of a scent and at the end in to a delicious, gourmand-like sweet vanilla that lingers on the skin for quite a while.\n\nIt's a very strong (at least to my nose) perfume, and I definitely wouldn't use more than one spray of it. I also wouldn't wear it through-out the day, since I feel like it's a bit much for a day to day wear. But I definitely see it being worn at night, in the fall or winter, when the notes can be appreciated due to the colder temperatures. \n\nI would recommend it to anyone, that likes the types of scents like Opium. I also see a little similarity to Addict.\nAll in all, a gorgeous perfume!", "26": "Oh, she bad. If Audrey Hepburn is the EDP, this is Dita Von Teese. Naughty, sexy grape candy.", "27": "I think this is one of the most beautiful fragrances I've ever smelled. It is absolutely intoxicating and head-turning. This is exactly what I would wear if I wanted to show out that I'm confident, I own it and I know what I'm doing. \nALL of the other perfumes do not even come close to the amount of confidence this perfume has. I feel like I've waited for a such a long time for this type of perfume to come to the market. \n\nThis perfume is basically the epitome of dark and mysterious bad bitch fragrances to me. I feel like it could be worn with any outfit to any occasion. I saw the bottle in the store and just smelled the cap and thought \"Hmm... okay, this could work.\" And when I sprayed it on my wrist... I kid you not I could not stop smelling myself for the entire evening. It was just intoxicating! The sweater I wore also picked up this scent, so I basically ended up wearing the same sweater for entire week because I wanted to smell like this every day. And since I couldn't stop thinking about it and kept wearing that same sweater over and over again I just had to order it (it was getting a little bit embarrassing). So I did. And I do not regret this because it is my new favourite scent now.\n\nOn my skin I get the most beautiful blend of vetiver and sandalwood with a hint of jasmine and patchouli on the background. The tuberose is not so prominent for me for some reason (despite everyone's votes) and is just the note that ties everything else together and makes this fragrance unique. The prominent vetiver and sandalwood really make this the IT perfume for me. \n\nIt does have a sliiight powdery feel to it, so be aware of that. Thus it reminds me of Narciso Poudree - the DNA of that perfume is present in this one. The core, the essence is the same, but I would say that Narciso is more softer, more cute and held back.. like your daytime work-personality. Whereas L'Interdit Rouge is like it's dark and mysterious nighttime sister. \n\nI think the perfumers really deserve an award for this perfume and I have a feeling that it will grow in popularity and become another classic on the market. I hope it will get some awards this year on Fragrantica as well because it really does deserve it. \n\nComplexity: 10/10\nSillage: Moderate, but can be built to fill the room\nLongevity: Long lasting \n\nTLDR; Wear this if you want to show out that you're confident, you own it and you know what you're doing. It is absolutely the most intoxicating and head-turning bad bitch fragrances currently on the market. An absolute masterpiece. 10/10 would recommend trying.", "28": "This is a MAN EATER fragrance. If you want to smell like THAT bitch. It smells like pure luxury, money, sexiness!\n\nIt opens with spicy blood orange and ginger then quickly begins to melt into heady white florals and sandalwood. It\u2019s rounded, smooth, and ooooh so sexy! This is my current favorite fragrance of the moment, I seriously can\u2019t stop sniffing my wrist when I wear it. PERFECT date night scent - or when you just want to feel like the ultimate boss babe!", "29": "Wow!! This is a really awesome tuberose. And I thought that BDK\u2019s Tubereuse Imperiale was nice\u2026. This takes the cake as the most beautiful tuberose scent I\u2019ve tried. \n\nTruly intoxicating\u2026.", "30": "I actually like this version.  The opening of this gorgeous red bottle is mesmerizing.  It reminds me of gingerbread cookies.  Overall it smells delicious but not unique as I expected.  For me the intense version smells better.  This can easily get boring because the smell becomes generalized once it dries.  But it still smells good and the longevity is nice.", "31": "She is the baddest bitch in town. You have to wear this with whatever you feel sexiest in, it will amplify the feeling ten times over.", "32": "To me, this smells just like an old-fashioned soda shop. Aromatic wooden floor boards that creak, the musk that only decades of time can give, and the sweetness and spice you can smell on soda syrups but that aren\u2019t apparent upon tasting. I do think it smells like Dr. Pepper, as a previous reviewer complained\u2014but I love it. I think it\u2019s something about how the ginger + pimento leaf combine. It does remind me of when I visited the Dr. Pepper museum in Texas when I lived close-by in my youth. The museum has/had an old-time soda counter where you could get Dr. Pepper floats that tasted much like this smells.\n\nThis has the same base as the original L\u2019Interdit (modern, not Hepburn-era of course), and is strongly tuberose-scented after about 5 minutes, yet it is completely different from the original at the same time. I own this one because it captivated me in the store, but I think it would be worth having both to use for different moods/occasions. It is spicy, sweet, seductive, mature, and pretty unique compared to current perfume trends. It is very much a cold weather scent\u2014I think this might smother me in summer. It lasts eternally on clothes and a good 8 hours on the skin.\n\nI think that while this is obviously one of the best mainstream scents of the year, it is not a safe blind buy. You would have to be into tuberose as well as spicy-sweet smells. I, however, am totally in love with it. Try it on your skin if you see it in a store and see what you think.", "33": "The bottle is absolutely lovely. The scent opens beautifully with red berries and citrus at first, but 30 minutes later it becomes identical to L'interdit intense version just added some cigarette note. All in all it is a good and enjoyable perfume", "34": "I\u2019m obsessed with this fragrance! It\u2019s sexy AF! I would wear this anytime though because I just love it that much! It\u2019s the most unique of the L\u2019interdit franchise and yes it\u2019s for a person who has had life experience as one other reviewer said! It\u2019s not an old smelling fragrance but a person who appreciates the slight nostalgic aroma of it will most definitely appreciate it for all its glory. I will absolutely be buying a FB very soon!", "35": "This is my new favorite. The blood orange and ginger smells like a spicy, addictive candy. The kind that is tart and sweet and you just can\u2019t stop reaching in the jar for more. I can smell it on myself and for the PRICE, Delina and MFK move over! I am IN LOVE. My new signature scent. It\u2019s polarizing as I can see down below. That\u2019s ok! This is not meant to be a crowd pleaser floral. This is a statement perfume. A MUST have for those who love spicy sweet scents!", "36": "SO beautiful. This fragrance is exactly what I imagine a femme fatale to smell like. It's feminine, dark, and so sexy. The color of the bottle describes the fragrance perfectly.", "37": "Stunner. Opens Up like a spicier Interdit EDP but then turns into like a milky tuberose with clear jasmine scent (smells a bit in the middle like Mastic gum from the Middleeast, yummyyyy). Very seductive smell that sure will turn heads. Performance is great and leave a nice scent bubble. Surely for fall and winter. I feel this is a great upgrade of the original EDP. Big Love.", "38": "Hands down the best l'interdit flanker. This is much more interesting than the original in my opinion. On my skin, I get Jasmine the most, which gives this fragance a soapy vibe.(does anyone else get a hint of pure poison or it is just me!?) Like clean out of the shower and spicy and misterious at the same time if that makes sense. Also I don't find it heavy at all and it's super wearable but I feel like you must be into spicy notes and white florals to enjoy this one. \nOverall is a nice scent, to me is a solid like since the notes aren't really my cup of tea but I respect Givenchy for not taking the overdone, generic, sweet, boring designer route. This is bold and makes me feel confident, I just wish it stayed longer!", "39": "The more I wear it, the more I fell in love with it. I never smelled something like this before, I feel like I\u2019m trapped in some spell\u2026this is so intoxicantingly beautiful. Everytime I wear it I receive so many compliments and I think this is my charm for seduction.", "40": "I wish this came out first because I could have just bought this one and skipped the original. When I say original, I mean the new version that came out I think in 2018(?)\u2026 not the Audrey Hepburn version which was totally different and I\u2019ve never smelled. Just wanted to be clear on that. But anyway, this one smells like a more complete version. It has a deep warmth to it which rounds out the sweetness and gives it purpose. Still performs as fantastic as the original. It\u2019s simply the better version. I did not like the original at first, but it did grow on me. And with this one, it was love at first sniff. It does have a light spicy feel, but it really comes together as more of an added warmth rather than smelling full on spices in all their glory. It\u2019s well blended to the point where I can\u2019t pick out a singular note, but if I\u2019m looking at them I\u2019m like \u201cokay, yeah\u2026 I can see that.\u201d While nodding my head in agreement. It does smell almost gourmand, due to the sweetness, but does not resemble any specific sweet treats. More of an overall feeling. You must like warm, and you must like sweet. If yes to those two, you should probably get your nose on it. It\u2019s beautiful. And lasts all day too!", "41": "Sex in a bottle! \n\nOr forbidden (L'interdit means forbidden in French) sex in a bottle. \n\nShe's confident, sexy, playful, intriguing, dangerous, bold, mysterious... Dressed in burgundy dress, has eyes of a predator, and smile of an angel... Playing with her is like playing with fire. And she smells like L'interdit Rouge. When she passes by, men can't stay indifferent. \n\nLongevity - great. Projection - great. Smell - great. Stays on clothes - for days. \n\nThis scent is not meant for everyone and not safe blind buy. However for my nose it's a pure perfection.\n\nUPDATE: This perfume is constant compliment getter!", "42": "A deep, sexy spicebomb that will have you wanting to reach for your highest stilletos.\n\nI love most of the L'Interdit range, and Rouge is no exception. This perfume to me is like bottled confidence. The ultimate date night perfume. She's classy, she's red, she's a little mature but still rocks her patent black heels. I have been complimented EVERY. SINGLE. TIME I've worn this!!! I walk like I'm a glamorous 90s supermodel storming the catwalk in a velvet dress and high choker when I wear Rouge. She makes me feel fearless and confident. \n\nI got this for my mum and I can't help but steal a spray every now and then. She also smells amazing with this scent on and even my nose-blind dad complimented her! She's told me it's her favourite perfume for special occasions.\n\nI might just have to find a little bottle to add to my collection before she notices that I've been sneaking a spray every now and then... This really is the most beautiful autumn scent.", "43": "I know this might be oddly specific ,but this smells like a sexy version of Wild Berries Skittles. \n\nIt has the perfect balance of everything you'd want in a fragrance. Sweet but not Cloying, Sexy and dark yet wearable and versatile, and that beautiful blood orange mixed with ginger is magnificent! GOD, I cannot get enough of it. I need to bath in it. \n\nAnd I agree with the other commenter, This is Lana del Rey \"Cola\" in a bottle.", "44": "Everything that they say about this perfume is true!

Something about this fragrance powers me up to my most feminine self before I leave my house. 9/10.", "45": "This is beautiful. Stunning slightly spicy powdery goodness. Definitely a cooler weather scent. I imagine wearing a big fluffy jumper and this would compliment it perfectly. I love the l'interdit line so much.", "46": "This is my Deep Red Hugo Boss from the '90s!  Not a scent you'd want for everyday, as it's a unique type of scent, but something you can enjoy from time to time, in a particular mood.  \n\nGoes on strong, but after a couple hours it dries down to a great skin scent.  Predominantly blood orange with woody spice, on the gourmand side.\n\nNot a safe blind buy, but if you liked Deep Red, you will definitely like this one.", "47": "What makes me love the Eau de Parfum and Mill\u00e9sime versions of L\u2019Interdit is the delicious orange flower note, hence the absence of orange flower makes Rouge less special to me. I perceive the dry down as sweet and a bit nondescript because the sweetness makes it difficult to distinguish single notes. It would be a nice winter perfume for fans of sweet perfumes. However, orange flower lovers like me might not find what they are looking for in this one.", "48": "What a beautiful, alluring scent this is. Sweet tuberose with a hint of a dark cherry accord, very warm, intense, creamy and spicy. It is slightly similar to Alien Fusion by Mugler - spicy with a bubblegummy sweetness to it, but instead of cinnammon in Fusion, there is something deep and cherry-like. I am yet to test it properly, but longevity and projection-wise, this seems to be intense. Definitely addictive! I love both, Fusion and this one.", "49": "What an intoxicating, bold, well-blended sweet and spicy fragrance. \n\nIt reminds me of a sarsaparilla, boozy fruit mince tart and Chrismas Pudding.\n\nIt is great for evenings, date nights and a couple\u2019s intimate nights."}, "49": {"0": "I'm going to tell you a story, since descriptions are certainly not lacking here.  \nWhen I was 17, I was introduced to Angel, fell head over heals with her, and subsequently met my first HUMAN love a couple of months later. We were one another's first... Well... Everything essentially. His mom didn't like me; I was a red lipstick wearing, 20 eye Dr Martin sporting punk as fuuuuuuhhhhh teenager brazenly waltzing into her house leaving a trail of the dirtiest, sexiest, most illicit perfume ever, with an attitude and the cleavage to match. As an aside, I'm a mother of a teenaged boy now- I would've hated my guts too. Anyway, we broke up a year and a half into our otherwise perfect relationship because he's totally a mama's boy. I noticed immediately that my bottle of Angel was missing, and was convinced his sister stole it because she was always telling me how good I smelled. Not wanting to deal with the heartbreak of seeing him, I sucked it up and bought another bottle. Fast forward 10 years later, I started kind of dating someone. A few weeks in, I realize his room mate is THE BOY, so I did what anyone would've done and dumped the dude for his room mate. On our third date, we were watching a movie in his room, when he reaches over into his drawer and pulls out this bottle of Angel, the juice all weird and discolored and almost gone. He had kept my perfume for over ten years, spraying it every once in a while to remind himself of me. Ten years. Needless to say, things worked out. He's still my man, his mama has since decided that she loves me despite the fact that I still wear red lipstick and I'm still rocking Angel on the regular. She's much more open minded to our hand holding now that we are married. Goes to show you just how powerful olfactory memories can be- this perfume allowed me to pick up where we left off, as though the ten years without one another had never existed. My advice? Get a perfume that's too big for your britches and go make out in the back of a muscle car. It'll go somewhere pretty alright.", "1": "My dad just died. I never lived with him.

Some journal. I use perfume. For a day or so, my Vaniglia Mazzolari was the comfort I needed. Now it\u2019s time to dust myself off, dry my tears and get myself back together again. Nothing gets me to my badass self quite like the original Angel can. It\u2019s so complicated, powerful, emotive and in charge. It will wear many a woman who isn\u2019t confident or strong enough. You just can\u2019t let it. So if it is to be a success, you have to be on your game and in control. That\u2019s all I came to say.

It's very unisex.\nWell here is what I got. \nThe top notes are really golden honey, meringue and something between peach and wonderful passion fruit. Not even a single flower. \nRemember that fragrances change from skin to skin.\nThat was a very nice opening for me.\nThirty minutes later, while I was checking stores at the mall, I could notice a gorgeous moss as I had never felt before, real moss fresh from the forest mixed with musk, honey, patchouli and caramel.\nThe base notes on me are musk, a very fine and delicious patchouli, vanilla and the caramel evolved into toffee with some honey in the background.\nI just went back to the store and found the sales lady waiting for me smiling with the box.\nShe said, the moment I smelled it on you, I knew Angel was for you.\nShe was so right!\nI have never had so many compliments as I get wearing Angel.\nTo be honest, Angel is not cloying nor suffocating as others said.\nMaybe it's my skin's chemistry, or maybe we were meant for each other.\nYou must try this gorgeously addictive perfume at least once in your life.\nAbout the gender label let me tell you this.\nFirst, Angel is very unisex actually I found it more masculine than A-Men ( at least on me).\nAnd on the other hand, you just wear watever makes you happy and forget about labels.", "3": "This is my grandma's signature scent, but she is the coolest woman ever so that is not at all an insult to it.

She uses it all year round, the season or the occasion don't matter to her in the least. In her eyes it is just as office appropriate as it is concert appropriate. \nI think she is exactly the kind of woman that Mugler envisions in his odd creations.  \nAnd so I grew up smelling this cool perfume on my cool grandma and thinking that it's the most chic scent ever made. I still do.  \nMy cool grandma has taught me to never fall into categories, never follow the rules or social norms \"just because\" and never be boring.  \nI now live in a different country and one of the first things I did was buy a small Angel for myself. I remember my cool grandma whenever I smell it. \nI love using it, and weirdly enough adore it even more in the summer! It smells brave, outgoing and \"obnoxious in a good way\" when it's hot.  \nTo conclude- a really cool scent, not for the faint hearted, and reminds me of one of my most favorite people ever! \nI will always have it in my collection.", "4": "Not since Shalimar have I done such a 180 on a perfume as I have with Angel.

I want to roll around in a pond of it and spew it from happiness like a dolphin. This stuff smells so freaking good to me now I can barely stand it. It is like opium, heroin, crack, crystal meth and bath salts all rolled into one very tacky bottle. But I love it so much the freaked out bottles are even appealing to me now. What was once considered the anti-Christ of perfume to me is now a star shaped blue deity.

Nevertheless, this perfume became a superstar and an icon of the fragrance world; flipping it upside down, never to be the same again.

Now, I am trying to think of an occasion or place I'd like to wear this and here's what I've come up with:\n\n- Work? NOT A CHANCE IN HELL\n- Gym? Certainly not\n- Night out? I'd hate to run into a 20 year old, beaming with pride for outgrowing Pink Sugar, wearing the same fragrance as me, while I look desperate to hold on to the last shred of my youth. Hahahaa!\n...And the winner is...\n- Home! while cleaning the house, especially during the cooler months. I'm going to wear this uplifting, forceful, shooting star with abandon. Let it fill every room of my house with that lovely patchouli, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink, as I dance, while I dust and sweep! Ha!", "7": "With cult classics like Angel, I tend not to bother belaboring in-depth reviews just because I think everything there is to say about them has already been said by thousands of people before me in more eloquent ways. So instead of reviewing, I just wanted to share a few sentiments. Personally I find such commentary in these review sections equally as interesting, so I hope others may see mine the same way.\n\nAngel was my first signature scent---the first high end fragrance that enchanted and enthralled me like nothing before ever had. My sophomore year of college reeked of it season after season after I shelled out $50+ for the tiniest bottle Sephora sold. For me then, owning it was like a rite of passage. It was my pride and joy, my tried and true. People knew me for this scent. Because I am such an introverted and soft-spoken person, I always found comfort in wearing bold fragrances because they say things about me that I usually cannot verbalize. For the past few years I have owned a 100ml bottle and I still love it dearly, but I find I don't reach for it very often. In fact, only a fraction of the juice is missing. It's larger than life... Sometimes I feel as though I am not worthy enough to wear it. As I type this, I am revisiting Angel for the first time in a while after having sprayed the backs of my hands right before I go to sleep. The emotions I am flooded with when I smell it...I couldn't even begin to list them, but I feel them all at once. A cyclone of memories that feel so distant that it's almost as if I didn't actually experience them.\n\nThere is now something melancholic about Angel. I feel as though I cannot wear this publicly; I have to reserve it for private, solitary moments like the one I am in right now: lying in bed, no TV or sounds, no lights or other smells...just me and this fragrant portfolio of pangs and bittersweet souvenirs. Angel makes me feel vulnerable, and mortal, and fragile. Nothing lasts forever, but I feel as though Angel is as close as anything can get.", "8": "I was 19 on holiday in Rome with my parents the year that Angel was launched. I remember the city was floating in this heavenly intoxicating scent, like nothing I'd ever experienced before. Every department store and fragrance boutique suspended in a cloud of this overwhelmingly beautiful scent. My mother and I fell in love instantly and were lucky enough to be gifted a bottle each from my dad. My mom has since passed and this will always remind me of her and our love affair with a city and an Angel.", "9": "I am 8 years old, a relative visits, she hangs her coat in the hallway, and I fall deeply in love with the otherworldly, enchanting smell that quickly envelops our home. Days pass and I bury my face into the coats that had lay adjacent to hers, their smell still as strong days later. My mother remarks with somewhat of a smirk, \u201cit\u2019s Angel.\u201d\n\nAt 15, precocious and awkward, I decide it is time to buy my first \u201cproper\u201d perfume. A simple decision in my mind, it was always going to be that powerful potion I had fallen for so quickly as a child. When I arrive home, I spray my pulse points once with glee, and wait for that hypnotising smell. And I wait\u2026 And I wait. \nAngel sat uncomfortably on my skin, acrid, disjointed. It was entirely too loud, too much, and it did not want me wearing it. It was dirty, and overtly sweet and.. was that BO? I couldn\u2019t understand how this could possibly be the perfume I had smelled. I sensed the similarity, as if it were a very bad drawing of the original. It must be the fault of the perfume, a reformulation, surely. It was shoved to the back of some drawer, to be forgotten.\n\nApproaching my mid 20s I search for my \u201csignature.\u201d Once more, I am a very serious adult lady and need a very serious adult lady perfume. I find the majority pleasant but rather dull. Like the North Star guiding me home, my eye lands on a certain bottle containing an unmistakable blue liquid. Round 2. I spray once on my wrists warily, wait a few moments, and am transported to my hallway aged 8. I purchase the bottle instantly.\n\nOn the train home, after a quiet five minutes the woman sitting next to me kindly compliments me, and asks what perfume I\u2019m wearing as she would love some herself. I reply sheepishly with Angel and her brow furrows, quizzical. \u201cOh,\u201d she remarks. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell like that on me.\u201d\n\nAngel, on the right person, at the right time, is really unlike any other perfume. It is heavenly, extraterrestrial and perfectly strange in the most alluring, comforting and hypnotic way. She is to be treated (and applied!) very delicately. Yes, there is patchouli - and yes, it is clearly very sweet - but listing notes or dissecting a perfume like this really doesn\u2019t do it any justice whatsoever. I have lost count of people telling me they love how I smell but how much they usually hate Angel, and they are in disbelief that\u2019s what I am wearing. Have patience, give her second, third and fourth chances, apply carefully and Angel will surely reward you.", "10": "Never trust anyone who dislikes Angel.", "11": "Sigh...looks like the girls are having an Angel war while the boys are over there warring over Diors new Sauvage with Johnny Depp as the spokesman. \n\nIt is so easy to hide behind your computer screen and say vicious things about most subjects these days isn't it? In the world of art, and fragrance is art, it is very common for people to have vastly differing opinions. That's fine. But it is the height of ignorance and snobbery to voice your opinion in vulgar and tasteless ways. \n\nThere are factors that have to be considered when analyzing a perfume. 1) your preference 2) others preferences 3) the effect on those around you ( you may enjoy it but it might cause someone else a migraine) When we look at the credentials of Angel, there is a lot to be said. First of all, Mr. Olivier Cresp is one of the finest perfume artist of our time. Angel is 23 years old. (Most the people who say bad things about this perfume weren't even born when this came out) Also, Angel has been inducted into the perfume version of the Hall of Fame! How could that have happened if it was as vile as people make it out to be?\n\nI am biased because I am an Angel fan. I also am a perfume fan and the worst perfume I have ever smelled did not smell like dirty vagina (not something I am well versed in anyway), a truck stop air freshener, old piss, blood, and so on. I have to wonder? When people say these things what their personal experiences in life are? Maybe they need to consider removing themselves from these deplorable situations in which they discovered these disgusting odors. Critiquing Angel should be the least of their worries.\n\nFor those of you who are interested, or had a bad experience with Angel but are still intrigued, I have a couple of suggestions. First, if you like the idea of Angel but patchouli doesn't agree with you (maybe you live in a humid, hot climate) you might try to get your hands on Nirmala by Molinard. It is similar in concept but no patchouli more fruit. Second, if you really want to try Angel but are limited on funds (that's how I discovered Angel) there is a designer imposter brand that does an AMAZING duplicate. It's called Instyle fragrances. I did a test and I was shocked at the likeness. It made me question my NEED for the real thing...but you know, it's always nice to have the good stuff. \n\nIn closing, I feel like the criticism of this perfume is very overblown. When writing a review for people to read, you should ask yourself 'is this relevant? Will this help someone make a sound decision?' If not....don't bother.\n\nThank you for your time!", "12": "Ok..Angel is the only reason I registered :p\n\nWhat to say..I'm 18,\nIt was a cold winter, I was in a bus driving to school.. A girl passed me by, I was so intoxicated by her scent that I couldn't get it out of my head for days.. I even serched it on the internet, describing it as a lavander :D, don't ask me why, I was never really interested in perfumes before.. I thing it was patchouli that I really liked.. Anyway.. I kept seeing that girl over and over again.. I didn't want to ask her about her parfume cuz I didn't know her and she didn't seem really nice lol.. But I realized that the girl I know is her friend.. I begged her to ask her about the perfume she was wearing.. After few days she told me it was called 'Angel'.. Being ignorant when it comes to scents I had never heard of it before.. I went to the drug store and spreyed it on a paper.. I was so dissapointed, tought I had the wrong name.. But.. I decided to give it one more try, sprayed it on my hand, still awful..And then... The most beautiful scent I have ever smelled :).. I'm a big chocolate and cotton candy addict but I don't think I would like it if it was only sweet, the patchouly which gives him sharpness is what makes it so special.. It was 6 months ago..Still don't have it.. Im a teen so my budget is not that high :/.. But, I'm getting some money from scholarship and this is the first thing I'm going to buy.. 2 weeks and he will be mine <3.. I know it's summer, and here in my country summers are so hooot:(.. I'm a winter girl like my name says it :p.. I'll just keep it safe and smell it every day until autumn comes :)) And read all the reviews :D\n\n\nI love Angel.. It's just everything I ever wanted of a  perfume.. I've never been do obssesed by anything :D\nHe showed me the beautiful world of perfumes :)\nCan't wait till you're mine..\n\nSorry for my english :D..", "13": "I am absolutely baffled, and frankly, a bit scared...somewhere Agents Mulder and Scully must have a file devoted to the unexplained mystery of this scent.\n\nThe first few times I smelled this scent back in the day, intrigued by the beautiful bottle, I just dismissed it as bizarre and unpleasant, like a lollipop dropped in dirt or a crotch in acid-washed jeans, and moved on. \n\nAfter my perfume obsession took hold, I heard countless perfumistas express one of two possible views on this fragrance- the first being that it's disgusting, vulgar, outrageously offensive, and the second being that Angel is delicious, entrancing, addictive, an endless love. Last year I sheepishly found myself falling for Angel Eau Sucree (original 2014 release), which inevitably led to my reading more about the famed queen Angel (from which all gourmands spring and through which all flankers are made), and I wanted desperately to understand! \n\nSo I sampled it anew, and remembered a woman I knew when I was a kid, a sweet younger lady who cleaned houses for extra money, and always smelled to me like a mixture of light body odor and ammonia or Windex...and upon this testing it suddenly dawned on me that she may have just been wearing Angel the whole time! My next encounter with Angel was when I smelled it on an aunt at a large outdoor wedding, from rows away. I suddenly understood how some people find this so intrusive and inappropriate--here I was at a wedding in an open field surrounded by grass, sky, flowers, and over a hundred other human beings, and all I could smell on the breeze was Angel.\n\nYou would think, at this point, that I would dismiss Angel from my consideration with a \"good for you, not for me, thanks.\" But after reading about it again this week and seeing the beautiful celestial bottle and the icy otherworldly ads, and once again reading testimony from its diehard fans, I felt myself drawn still to investigate this mystery. I dug out my sample from its depths and applied the tiniest drop, which was inconclusive. The next morning, emboldened, I very lightly spritzed one wrist and went about straightening up my apartment. The initial spritz knocked my mouth open in shock, it was so sour, so outrageous. And then it smelled like tangy berries, pubescent body odor, and urine. It was bad, right? So why did I keep smelling it? And why did I spritz a bit more on before going to bed?? It's like I craved those insane, sharp opening notes. This time the urine note smelled more like the honey it purports to be, and I enjoyed the wafts I got from the tiny bit I dabbed on my neck, while being fully aware that this scent was strange. And then this morning...you know what I did. I wanted to smell it again. \n\nWhat is happening to me? Is this how this scent ensnares its devotees? And is the B.O. note truly a matter of \"chemistry,\" or of perception (as in, you may or may not perceive it on yourself, but it's there, and people unused to this scent will perceive it on you and wonder about your hygiene)? Am I fated to get a beautiful tiny star bottle of this to wear in secret, spraying more and more each time until I am hopelessly addicted and become that person that others sniff and say \"Angel, in this setting? How inappropriate, poor thing, she doesn't know how vulgar she smells,\" while I just can't wait to score my next hit of those sweet and sour topnotes?\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I just need to sneak into the bedroom and spray something on real quick...\n\nUPDATE: Well. I've worn it every night for the past 9, and just caved and bought a bottle today. It's captivating.", "14": "Oriental vanilla, my a**! \nThere is NO capsule term that will ever describe Angel. Angel is like the first time you see a real rhinoceros, it's so darn big and ugly and prehistoric, yet it's beautiful, and it should be impossible BUT there it is.\n It's the massive collision of contradictory unusual smells all at once that makes Angel so outrageous. It's like smelling a gourmet burger that a pregnant women would crave, bergamot meatballs with black chocolate sauce dolloped on high blue Roquefort cheese in vanilla syrup. And astonishingly somehow it hangs together as one creature,like the rhinoceros. This is not so much perfume as an act of perfume terrorism. Be afraid, be very afraid.", "15": "When I'm not feeling like myself--Angel is a good place to turn to. It has been my signature scent since I was fifteen. I remember feeling smug when the sales assistant at Macy's made a comment directed to my mother that I was too young to be purchasing this Mugler masterpiece. \n\nI wore this every day in college. I never had enough money to purchase another perfume during undergraduate and the large bottle my mother bought me lasted YEARS. My best friend works at the Sephora located in the meatpacking district and will spray this on herself when she misses me. \n\nI thank the universe that this scent is so polarizing otherwise everyone would be wearing it. I recently picked up a 1.1 oz.. bottle of Angel at Marshall's for $40 and definitely noticed a difference in silage/longevity...must be a reformulation. Oh well, I will take what I can get with this magical, delicious concoction. Now I just spray a couple more times and layer with my Angel roller- deodorant and body butter. I truly am addicted. \n\nOn my skin it smells like a battle between good and evil-- HEAT and DELICACY;  Patchouli , Cotton Candy , Apricot, Caramel, Chocolate, Vanilla, notes of pineapple , My Oh MY! \n\nIf Angel agrees with your skin, your suitors will LOVE it on you--makes them weak in the knees. I've had a man tell me that I could \"get him to do anything with that perfume.\" I swear by it. The only person who told me they dislike Angel on me is my mother--but she is someone who always wants to smell like a beach. Sorry Mom, I am married to the ever-hypnotic Angel. \n\nNow I will stop here...but I could go on and on about this treasure. Thank you MUGLER, I blow your powerhouse many kisses.", "16": "Angel is probably one of the most important contributions to the perfumery world ever!\n\nAn outstanding perfume with a unique and delicious smell. \n\nPersonally? I spread the \"Angel Perfumed Body Cream\" on my wrists and neck and THEN apply Angel several times at least to ensure its persistence on me :))))\n\nThe result? An irresistible sweet trail that lingers the WHOLE day everywhere I go! People literally sniff me all day, and no one seems to think \"it's too much\".\nI work in a school, and let me tell you CHILDREN love it and always compliment me on how delicious I smell.\n\nI never find it to be too much. Layer it and enjoy it!\n\nHighly recommended!!!", "17": "OMG guys! I'm having a GREAT \"Angel Day\" today! Over the years, I have changed my vote from \"Love\" to \"Dislike\" to \"Like\" (because I was unsure), back to \"Hate\" (many times over) and now, today, I'm back at \"Love!\"  \n\nPatchouli is probably one of my least favorite notes of all time (my skin just AMPS it like nobody's business) and if I try Angel on the wrong day, I just smell like a hippie who tried to cover up BO by slathering on patchouli and rubbing bittersweet cooking chocolate on top of it. \n\nOhhhh, but not TODAY! It's a crisp, cold fall day and started by layering on the Angel body lotion. (which is incredible). Then I sprayed on my Angel - NOT too heavily, mind you. And THEN - I layered on some Choco Musk to ensure I bring out the other lovely facets of Angel, especially that chocolate note. I am in straight up heaven! \n\nToday, I can smell EVERY single note of Angel and they are interacting in perfect harmony - chocolate, cotton candy, sure - some patchouli stank is still in there, but there's still caramel, vanilla, cranberry; yep, there's the melon, oh what's that, pineapple? etc. I can detect EVERY note. And it's exquisite!\n\nThese days are rare, but when all the planets align, Angel can be one of the most beautiful smells ever. Today is a GOOD day!", "18": "I LOVE the complexity of this fragrance! It's a scent explosion of gourmand and oriental notes that literally reek of confidence, sex appeal, and glamour. Not for the faint of heart, this little number will surely turn some heads!  \n\nA word of advice: Some of you may really want to love this fragrance, but you just don\u2019t. That\u2019s ok!  But consider trying a few things before you chuck it back at Thierry Mugler.  \n\nFirst, I recommend experimenting with WHERE you apply Angel. I like to spray it once at the small of my back. I find it less abrasive and more courteous to others when meeting, greeting, and embracing, because if you spray your d\u00e9colletage, Angel is the ONLY thing they will notice. Imagine someone about to give you a hug and BAM!!!! Nose near the neck and ANGEL ANGEL ANGEL! Believe me, the lower back is a gorgeous place to wear this fragrance, because it\u2019s subtle enough not to offend, but warm enough to diffuse the scent properly. \n\nAnother way to wear this is to dab a bit (less is more) on your inner wrists (just don\u2019t rub or tap them together). Picture your special someone leaning in for a kiss. If you wrap your arms around their neck, they will get a hint of Angel from behind, enveloping you both in a light, airy cloud of perfume. The affect is breathtakingly beautiful and delicately enchanting.\n\nFinally, expand your scent palate. Each time you unleash the cap, try to recognize a single note. This time, honey. Next time, dark chocolate. Then smell caramel. Then rose, peach, red berries, cotton candy, etc. It will help make sense of this fragrance bomb, and then, hopefully, it will all come together! Now go love you some Angel!", "19": "OK guys, here's the deal. This is a fragrance that must be tried several times and only on the skin. Not a test strip and definitely not from sniffing the nozzle. Also, temperatures affect it. For me, it is a cold weather fragrance. I am a huge fan of Alien and was repulsed by Angel the few times I tried it. It has now become a love for me. I am thinking perhaps some people recoil at the first sniff because with a name like Angel one would expect something much different then what comes out. Never before have I seen a fragrance so mismatched with its name. Fallen Angel would be more well suited. Or Dirty Angel. Or Hot Mess Angel. \nI digress... \nThis is truly a fragrance masterpiece that has so many different phases to it. \nPlus, it is seriously one of the greatest drydowns ever. I wish they would make a flanker that smelled like nothing but what it smells like after being on my skin for 8 hours. \nNot for the faint of heart or the impatient. \nI get the hype now.", "20": "Angel is really reminiscent of walking through a carnival to me...the smell of the outdoors, on a perfectly cool night. You hear the swarm of families and drunken teenagers, while a whaff of delicious treats overwhelm your senses...caramel apples, cotton candy, churros, funnel cake, and buttery popcorn mixes with the earthy aromas of grass, damp air and trees. You smell faintly in the distance a fire pit. You are somehow calm in a sea of chaos.\n\nThis fragrance is near and dear to my heart as I started wearing it at 19 years old at the start of college when it managed to be the scent that would replace my Dior Hypnotic Poison edt. It was an instant hardcore love, but I could only pull it out for evening wear. Spray in the air once, walk through it and I was good to go. People could smell me a mile away. Angel puts a spell under anyone in contact with it. Sinful, Naughty, Sexy, Mysterious. The Queen of gourmands, this perfume stays with you, lingering on your clothes, your skin, your hair. For those who are virgins to Angel, my advice would be NOT to spray more than once as you will completely sabotage your appreciation for the scent. Love it, hate it, love to hate it or hate to love it - this is an extraordinary potion", "21": "I actively stayed away from Angel for years, saying things like \"nah, it's too sweet for me\", \"I can't do gourmand\" and \"I'll probably hate it anyway\". But curiosity got the better of me in the end and I ordered a sample with my new sample bundle. \nWhen I sprayed it first, I was like \"ok, they say you either love this or hate it but why do I just like it?\" I had yet to wait though. This is indeed gorgeous! It's gourmand, yeah, but there's so much more to it than just that. I always thought it's just candy and caramel, too boring and teenager-y and cloying but it's not. It's complex and sophisticated, classy and elegant! And surprisingly, it's not too sweet on my skin either. \n\nWell, roll me up in the lovers' club!", "22": "Angel....I've been trying to understand this perfume since the 90s when, as a teenager, I was enchanted by the bottle. This perfume is a floral-yet-somehow-still-edible beast. I want to eat my arm and rip it off at the same time. I love it. I hate it. I want to say it's tacky but it's not the least bit cheap. I want to say it's too sweet, but it's got a woodsy heart. It's heavy and heavenly at the same time. It's perverse. A sticky sweet yet muscular intellectual challenge. I love it but I hate it but I love it.", "23": "I've been wearing Angel for 30 years (since it was released) so I get the final say on this incredible fragrance. First up, do not EVER wear more than ONE SPRAY of this. Angel is exquisite, intoxicating, dreamy, alluring, mysterious, magical, sexy, hypnotic... in small doses. As soon as you cross the line and apply too much, you will asphyxiate the entire planet. Don't ever wear it to the office. Many people think Angel can only be worn in winter/night. It shines brightest then, I agree, but in microscopic doses, Angel becomes a radiant floral on a spring day and a creamy caramel milkshake on a hot summer's day. I've worn Angel to the beach in mid-summer and smelled like a dream. I have so many intense memories associated with this sensational power bomb. Wear it and float through the cosmos like a divine being.", "24": "If I had to choose between Alien and Angel, honestly, my nose would pick Alien. Funny thing is, Angel picked me, Alien did not love me back as much. It took a few years before I could appreciate Angel, but that first day that I actually wore it, I immediately got a compliment...then another, and another, nobody seemed to notice when I wore Alien. Some days, the bright, warm caramel and fudgy chocolate are forefront, supported by a damp, earthy patchouli...other days it's more woodsy and damp earth feminized with fuzzy sweet nuances of chocolate, caramel, honey. This is ofcourse after the loud, nose-singing top notes have dissipated. A potent woody-gourmand scent, it's feminine and very sweet, but with enough  patchouli depth for a gourmand-loving male to pull off I think. \n\nAngel would perhaps be too odd and dirty on a restrained, delicate lady. Too obnoxious on an A-type alpha-female. Too irrelevant on the fashion-conscious style princess. Too vulgar on a hardcore party girl. Too desperate on a sleek femme fatale. Too crude on a bling-decked glamor diva.\n\nBut for the urban bohemienne, the slightly loca but loveable outcast, the unpredictable free spirit with sparkly eyes...this is her perfume, regardless of her age, whether 20 or 60. She is the one who will tame Angel and smooth its jagged edges, the one who will bring out its cuddly sweet warmth and ethereal earthy-chocolate loveliness. If there was a celebrity who would be a perfect fit for this perfume, it would be Drew Barrymore (especially Drew from 10+ years back) with her innocent baby-face looks, her boho-chic fashion sense, her quirky, happy-go-lucky aura...and the reckless 'wild-child' dark side to her that she was notorious for off-screen. \n\nNever, ever overspray this. Two sprays, maximum three on cooler days, it will take you from day to night, any time of the year, as long as you don't put on too much (dabbing is better than spraying, a little goes a long way).", "25": "The fragrace of my 20s!\n\nMy first encounter with Angel was a scented Cosmo page in 94. Everything about it was bewitching, unique and I HAD to have it. Everyone knew how much I loved it, so Christmas and birthday gifts were blue boxes, filled with Angels heavenly scent, that could be smelled even before the gift was unwrapped. \n\nThis was my wedding fragrance in 95, on a snowy March day. I had all of the body products too, including the beautiful blue sparkling body powder, that my bare shoulders and hair were dusted with. \n\nThis has been a fixture in my collection ever since. Although I don't wear it often now, my collection will never be without a glass star, filled with it's heavenly blue juice.\n\nAngel will forever hold a very special place in my heart \u2764\ufe0f", "26": "I wore this when it first came out but after a couple of bottles I moved on to other fragrance, although still enjoyed having a sniff from the tester at Boots!\n\nMany years on, and I thought I really couldn't get away wearing Angel any more, so bought Innocent instead, which is lovely. However, the chance came up to buy Angel at a discount and I couldn't help myself!\n\nThe opening can be suffocating if you spray too much, but after a couple of hours Angel is at its best...I get rich warm honey-chocolate.\n\nMy husband says it smells like fly-killer, my mum hates it, and I would never wear it to work due to its offending nature, so I usually wear it going to bed when my husband works away....Angel feels like my guilty secret, and I like it like that. I wear Angel for me, and only me!", "27": "* THE REVIEW BELOW * by \u0639\u0644\u06cc\n\nAs a linguist, I was curious to understand what the review under mine meant, and I translated it on google, the language detected was Persian (Farsi)\nI think it is a beautiful review so I dared posting the English translation google provides.\n\n\"Angel was one of the most decoding and influential works of mass market perfection in the early 1990s. A delicious, fragrant fruit fragrance that finds itself all over the world. Chocolates, coconuts, candy with melon and Mandarin oranges are at the top of the perfume and there are some flavors around it. A unique combination of these notes to create a deep, sweet, and very special aroma that won the FIFA Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nFortunately / unfortunately (depending on the perspective), Angle had incredible commercial feedback, so that it took almost everyone to wear a special course. In the mid-1990s, every club, bar, restaurant, disco or public space was filled with a strong Angelic smell because every girl or woman used this great amount of Attra, so she quickly turned upside down with something annoying and annoying.\n\nNow, after almost two decades, it's time to work, and it seems that many people forget this, so that the angel can be worn again, but ladies, please ... Take care of your use.\n\nIt's a turning point for perfection and something you must try.\"\n\nIf you like this, upvote their review :) below mine", "28": "This is the first perfume that has made it from my dislike list straight into the love list.\n\nFor a long time I've found Angel overwhelming, nauseating and vulgar. Maybe it's not completely untrue but Angel is so much more. It is one of the most complex perfumes I've ever encountered. It has so many notes and layers, and when you test it for the first time it may just be too much of everything.\nMy repentance started, when I was in Paris 3 months ago. I smelled my most hated perfume on a lot of women and it suddenly began to intrigue me.\nTo make a full description of Angel would be almost impossible. I find it very hard to capture the essence of this fragrance. It keeps changing character from minute to minute, from each time you wear it, from woman to woman and according to the weather.\n\nOn my skin Angel always opens with a big alluring honey note which always lingers, though it may fade. Sometimes it transforms into a warm creamy tropical coconut scent with exotic fruits, which is one of Angels most beautiful aspects. Other times Angel is like a waft of hot chocolate drifting through a garden of lush flowers.\nAngel mostly settles to a bittersweet scent of honey combined with a hint of rose, amber and patchouli. I'm no patchouli lover, especially not when patchouli is mixed with sweet notes. However, I find the patchouli in Angel very muted and vague, more like licorice or anise.\nNo need to tell that this perfume definitely has sillage and longevity is extraordinary. \n\nAngel is an opulent controversial scent that doesn't please everyone, so I mostly spray with a light hand.\nI'm very happy that I gave Angel a second chance and not just rejected this masterpiece as being too loud and cloying. I simply had to approach Angel with a positive attitude to fall in love with it.\nI'm now a true defender of my beautiful Angel though I'm not blind to the darker side of her character.\n\nIn 3 words: CONTROVERSIAL - COMPLEX - ALLURING", "29": "NOT for the faint of heart!\n\nThis lovely, kind of awkward, bottle contains a perfume which is both the most BEAUTIFUL scent you've ever smelled, and yet, it can nauseate you.\n\nNot only is it a Gourmand, but it's the Mothership of all Gourmands! Lol One spritz, and you're enveloped in honey, chocolate, a little powder, and SUGAR! I'm not a biggie fan of gourmands, but I'm hooked. However, there's a method. Honestly, there has to be a method, otherwise I'd never be able to wear it again.\n\nCold weather. I'm talking about late December through mid-March in NYC kind of cold. A spray on ONE wrist, a little pat, and then a pat on the neck. Done. DONE! Any more, and it'll be overwhelming for hours. And, ladies and gents, this stuff doesn't just wash off all lickety split. The staying power is unreal. Soap, sleep... It sets up camp.\n\nThe good part? It smells divine. It gives you butterflies and makes you smile THAT smile which comes all the way from your toes. It's beautiful, happy, and your one bottle might just last you forever. Lol", "30": "I have had a love affair with Angel ever since it came out in 1992 and indeed I ONLY wore this for 12 years, every day and every night!\nI simply adore the smell, it's heaven in a bottle for me, it's a genius olfactory masterpiece and I know that as my perfume wardrobe increases and I grow bored of many of my fragrances, I will never stop loving this lady.  \nThis is a fragrance which shouts out 'I'm here, I'm big, I'm sassy and I'm beautiful! \nThis perfume leaves a veil of heaven as you pass her by, there's no mistaking this lovely lady.  \nShe is never incognito, never small, never subtle and never alone.  \nThis lady is a celebrity, everyone knows her, love her or hate her, she makes her statement!  Wherever she may go, she can never hide, nor does she want to!\nAngel, oh my wonderful angel! When I grow tired of you then I shall also be tired of life!", "31": "Picture this.\nYou were invited to a Masquerade Ball,\nthe women, some happened to be the wives of politicians, some were famed actresses, looked ridiculous with their meticulously polished face, big hair, diamonds and pearls, masks adorned with feathers and gemstones with almost every colour. \nThere were also women in their skin tight silk gowns, trying too hard to show off their curve.\n\nThe men with their slicked hair and tuxedo, were drinking and mingling even if reluctant. Everyone tried to be different but ended up looking identical. \n\nNothing else captured your attention except her, \nshe arrived the hall with no companion, \nno one knew who she was, \nshe wore a huge white gown adorned with thousands of gemstones, together with her light blue eyes, porcelain white skin and almost-white blonde hair, she shone like a star.\n\nYou, like everyone else, were curious but dared not to approach her, yet you took a deep breath...and greeted her.....Taking a bite on the macaroons in her hands, she deliberately ignored you and walked away from you, to the balcony drenched with moonlights.\n\nWould you give up and walk away? (Stop reading) \nOr would you follow her? (Keep on reading)\n\nYou followed her, you told jokes that made her giggle like a little girl, you realized she wasn't who she looked like, she was a fragile, lovely sweetheart. She slipped out of her dramatic gown, beneath it was a white silk nightgown, she winked at you naughtily and took you by the hands, you and her sneaked off to the kitchen and tasted desserts before everyone else did. You talked and played with her the whole night as she never seemed to get exhausted.\n\nAt midnight, both of you returned to the balcony, she smiled at you sadly as she slowly faded into glitters...flying back to the star-filled night sky.....loved her or hated her...she was still the most beautiful thing...she was an angel...", "32": "A few months ago I was at a supermarket & asked the girl serving me if she was wearing Angel. She was surprised that someone knew what it was. Her work colleagues had often asked her what she was wearing. She'd sweetly reply \"that's just what I smell like\". More recently I visited a friend & after an hour or more she looked directly at me, then told me how good I smelled. Yes, Angel again. You see, not all of us wear it badly. Or announce our arrival from a distance of one kilometre. With people dizzy & gagging, dialling emergency services... Some of us recognise Angel's strength during the process called \"breathing\". Also by reading the words \"eau de parfum\", like, \"Ohhh, not EDT?\" The dead give-away when it comes to recognising how much fragrance is too much is when you need to open the window to be near yourself. Many fragrances are over-powering if used liberally. I have some very STRONG perfume memories, involving LouLou, Rive Gauche, Beautiful, Macho (yes, Macho!) & others I can't name. I have been assaulted many, many times. But who isn't guilty of committing perfume assault? Angel cannot help the crimes of its wearers, now can it? But if you think the existence of Angel itself is a crime, hmmm... Well, I LOVE you Angel! Worn occasionally & in moderation, we remain close, & I can still afford to eat.", "33": "While reading reviews I've come to the conclusion that Angel is a perfume that chooses YOU. Unfortunately, I'm not one of the elusive chosen ones =( But, have you ever smelt Angel on somebody who's chemistry actually works with it?\n\nWOW! It is not harsh, stinky or dirty smelling.... It surrounds the wearer with a cosmic-like aura, yes it is ANGELIC. You can even wear it in summer... Because you see, when Angel choses you, it becomes apart of you. I cannot give you an exact description as it is so hard to pinpoint, I just wish it worked on me.", "34": "In my opinion, all gourmand perfumes need to be designed very carefully so that they don't become nauseating. Too much sugar may just make you sick!\nThis olfactory fatigue can occur during either its recurring use, or in a single application due to a strong projection and longevity. A high sillage can also infect those around us and create some group aversion to the fragrance. If a perfume stays on the market for a long time, its continued familiarity can also lead to some annoyance. As the eyes may also smell, the design and the very bold presentation of a bottle can get our attention at first, but over time it can become tiring.\nAngel is a very gourmand perfume, with high longevity, sillage and projection. It has been on the market for 28 years now and its bottle must have the most unique design in the history of perfumery!\nSo what is its secret? It can only tied to its formula and blending mastery, and so justifying why many women and men find Angel so sexy and appealing.\nAs with any masterpiece, this perfume also has its legion of haters. The loudness they create just increase the Angel awareness. The good things of life are always yin and yang. Quite a lot of years ago we the market witnessed the same effect with Tabu.\n\nIn the opening and heart we find a pi\u00f1ata full of ripe sweet fruit, desserts and cotton candy that in a short time are mixed with an extensive bouquet of nectary flowers. The scent is intense and pleasantly intrusive. The ambery bottom throws us with a bomb of a seductive patchouli, sweet spices, chocolate and caramel. Visually, I could only imagine this overly sweet scenario with some suspicion. However my nose does not think the same way. It likes what is proposed and even qualifies this fragrance with a unisex tendency so that I am willing to use it too.\nIn a woman I find this fragrance just irresistible.\nI do recommend it!", "35": "Like many others, when I first tried this fragrance several years ago my initial response was to be completely disgusted. The second time I tried it, I liked it a little more. When I got a sample of it a few months ago, I became obsessed. The opening truly is addictive which makes me want to douse myself in the stuff and made me borderline nose-blind to patchouli. I never even liked gourmands before this, and now I just want to try all the flankers and similar fragrances. Iconic scent, I can see why this has such a cult following.", "36": "Angel; a niche perfume that its creator decided to share with us at price and places of popular market. God save you Thierry, for this, for A*Men Pure Havane and others you' ll give us.\nLongevity, sillage, and, above all, fragrance, are worth of an expensive original niche perfume; problem is that, when you distribute it like popular, more people is not prepared to reach it. It's not a fault, it's just what really happens; think that most popular women perfumes are flowery-fruity ones, so it' s rare a real oriental (and a \"strange\" one, I add) is wellcome.\nBut if you are into orientals, you can' t dislike this original, wonderful, quality creation; something evolving and changing for hours, staying on skin for 24 hours and on clothes for days.\nWhile, if you like patchouli and cocoa.... well, that's your Graal. With anise, (these are the mainig notes for me), this is the mix makes most of people stay away from it, due to the harshness of cocoa mixed with the freshness-sweetness of Anise and the dark dirtyness of patchouli; it' s something that you can't like, if your nose is not prepared to.\nBut if you don' t like it, don' t leave it forever; I needed years to apreciate. In months, in years, if you' ll increase your perfumes knowledge, take it again in your hand; I think you will thank my suggestion.", "37": "I'm never done with Angel; she is a tidal force that presents swelling and receding notes in various weathers and climates. An ocean of influences. She does not *wear me*, as others have claimed she does with them (I agree with a previous poster; Angel CHOOSES you, and she has certainly picked me), but she does almost seem to evolve on me in some unpredictable ways...or it could be that my nose can never grasp the spectrum of notes and so I am in a unique state each time.\n\nBefore my most current note breakdown, I must admit my deep, deep emotional recall of this; it's something I have smelled in some nebulously vague way in childhood/adolescence so poignantly often, that I feel that I have been raised around it. Yet, nobody in my immediate or extended family has worn this (to my knowledge). Could it be that Angel is an accumulation of sweet childhood comforts wrapped into one artful experience; with the decidedly earthy notes of my Pacific northwest home and culture as some sort of firm and humming foundation via patchouli? I am uncertain. It is comforting in some familiar, but wholly alien (no reference or pun toward Mugler's other masterpiece) manner. It's as if the sweets were highlights of my upbringings, the florals were my developments into womanhood, and patchouli/sandalwood was somehow my home and what many friends (and boyfriends?) smelled of...yet it is not exact; and so it both evades and bothers me, yet comforts and transports me. It is 100% feminine, and 100% masculine; Angel is 200%. The associations both hurt, and soothe...they are both chill and warmth. It's wholly bittersweet.\n\n~Dichotomy~\n\n(*Edit*) Today (11/30) I smelled a maraschino cherry scent in the opening that I don't believe was a listed note. I have been blessed to experience some of the melon mentioned too, with some coconut, but no distinct red berries. Cotton candy and vanilla are so delightfully paired and powerful, they mask the others at times; but are heart wrenchingly sweet. Tonka is there as well, from beginning to end. In fact, it's still embedded noticeably 3 weeks later in my leather jacket I sprayed in the beginning of November. \n\nJasmine can blend so well with others if done a certain way; but I have been capable of pinpointing that note after an hour or so of wear. Rose is surprisingly not as strong as I anticipated; another Mugler twist since rose often dominates. In this, the Queen Of Flowers is backstage assisting others. I don't find this to be an overtly floral fragrance, but there is some to be discovered in the process of living in the Angel cloud.\n\nThis fragrance is disproportionately (yet, perfectly) heavy in basenotes. It has layers and layers of longevity due to the beautifully huge foundational components. Cocoa, caramel, and patchouli are so ornate and rich that it's nearly nonsense entirely; but they develop along the ever touted line of genius/madness; which is precisely the heart of *why* this fragrance is, and will always be, an uncontested piece of history and total masterpiece.\n\nTL;DR\nAngel is an iconic original piece of fragrance history, full of pushes and pulls, and to me it's utterly brilliant...like a star.", "38": "Out of all the perfumes I have had, Angel was the only one with the ability to fill up a room. Nothing else came close to performing that way. Its so strong, yet it isn't heavy or cloying. Does it smell good, does it smell bad? What is that smell? It's spicy; juicy, it's a chocolate stain, it's a beautifully interesting mess. It scatters it's glittering, bewildering stardust everywhere. It has a presence unlike no other; this would definitely go well on any person who have the tendency to \"light up\" a room, in terms of mood and conversation.", "39": "Turns out, if we are talking about Alien vs Angel, I\u2019m definitely an Angel girl. \n\nThis is not the regular angel one might be envisioning though; a serene human on a cloud with wings and a halo. No. This is old testament-eyes-everywhere-six-pair-of-wings-with-golden-hooves angel. Glorious and frightening at the same time. Its presence might be too much for you. If an acid trip were a scent it would be Mugler\u2019s Angel.\n\nIt is multi-faceted and all-encompassing in its composition. At one moment I\u2019ll smell chocolate and passion fruit, but when I smell my arm once more I can\u2019t quite discern the notes. Something crystal clear, yet something thick? Something green flashes by and then sugar or vanilla\u2026 None of the notes are clear to me and yet they are all there all at once joint in a divine but deafening symphony.\n\nI can see how Angel is a controversy in the world of perfume, it definitely makes a statement. Unapologetic and unique, it will take you on a ride.", "40": "Probably the most iconic new generation fragrance of all time. Paved the way for modern gourmand fragrances and even with the formulation changes, it is still as iconic and unforgettable. I fell in love with this as a child playing with my mom's fragrances (I'm 23) and wasn't able to differentiate between fragrances, except with Angel. It always stood out to me, she was the main character. I will say that it might smell differently from person to person. My mother hates the new formulation but enjoys how it smells on me because my skin chemistry brings out the Cotton Candy notes. Even with the formulation changes, I still love it just as much as I did when I was a child. Despite Angel now being 30 years old, she is still youthful-- she's like the girl who never shows a sign of aging. Long live Angel, you're a huge part of Thierry Mugler's legacy!", "41": "Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress \nRebel Rebel, your face is a mess \nRebel Rebel, how could they know? \nHot tramp, I love you so!\n\nEvery time i wear this fragrance i think of the outfit buffy the vampire slayer wore, you know the one, innocent baby pink prom dress with kitten heels teamed with a bikers leather jacket and of course a cross bow! lol well that kind of sums this fragrance up for me. \n\nThe bottle is VERY misleading though! I sometimes wonder if that is why so many people are put off so badly upon first spray? People really should get some sort of a heads up to prepare themselves for this intense olfactory experience! Its a little bit like the time my Grandpa gave me an olive when I was 7 and told me it was a grape! The deception! I threw up all over the kitchen and avoided olives for years, just the thought of an olive was enough to make me wretch. In my thirty's i discovered that I actually love olives! Okay I know we are talking about perfume but you get what I mean. I mean look at it sitting there all angelic with its innocent looking baby blue juice and (also innocent looking) pretty star shaped bottle. It screams I am girly fresh and innocent, probably aquatic...white floral...soft musk...etc then bam the poor unsuspecting tryer onner is floored with a patchouli choke punch from perfume hell! Im just sayin some people may appreciate it a little more at first sniff or at least not be put off so badly if the bottle/name fit the perfume better just like some people might of liked olives way before their 30's if someone had said \" hey Zoe, this is an olive, it looks like a sweet delicious juicy grape BUT it isn't. its nothing like a grape. Its a little bit bitter and a little bit salty, and not at all sweet. Would you like to try one?\".  \n\nI love Angel, there really is nothing else like it. I have never hated Angel but their have been times in the past that we have just drifted apart but I always always come back to her. She has been a staple in my collection since first sniff (around 18 years ago) and always will be.", "42": "Wow, wow, wow! This perfume confuses me to the extreme! It is so amazing, and I have never in my life smelled anything quite so intriguing!\n\nThis was a blind buy along with Alien, so I was really taking a chance as the reviews seem very love/hate on this one, but I really do love it a lot- I just can't work it out!\n\nIt hits the senses with so many notes, there's so much going on! It's like trying to find your way to the exit through a huge noisy crowd of people but you don't know which way to turn!\n\nThe patchouli is definitely most prominent on me, then the blackberry weirdly, then the other notes start making an appearance, and I have to really concentrate trying to pick them out, and that's what I love about it, it has me guessing all the way to the very end. I definitely do not get a body odour type smell at all from this, only a slightly earthy smell after it has dried right down.\n\nIt's mesmerizing, intoxicating, confusing, intriguing, unique... I love it!! Alien still has my heart, but I love this one enough to definitely be repurchasing!", "43": "Pay no attention to the vulgar, creepy, objectifying review below me (which has now been removed). *shudders* It smells nothing like they described (they said it smelled like vag... wth? and eww). Not once when I've worn this do I think about the creepy stuff they are thinking about, nor am I inviting some creep to seduce me. You do NOT think for me. That is purely their misogynistic/chauvinistic brain in leery, creepy fantasy mode. \n\nWhat it does smell like is earthy patchouli and dark chocolate along with some subtle, sweet honey and caramel in the drydown. I've never perceived Angel as an overly sweet sugary scent at all, more earthy and peppery than anything else. Oddly, I never get cotton candy or berries or any of the other notes listed, but I do love Angel and it's one of my favorites.", "44": "If my body odour smelled this good, I'd never shower again.\n\nHeavenly stuff.  I tried the EDT last year (it was the only one they had out on display), because I, being a novice, had mistakenly assumed it was identical to the original but perhaps not as strong.  I remember a blast of menthol and warm, wet earth.  Not unpleasant, a little masculine - I just didn't 'get' it.\n\nI received my sample of the EDP today.  The first twenty minutes is dark greenery - and I usually shy away from green notes - but there's a moist warmth here that makes it more tolerable.  And then, the heart of Angel opens up and BOOOMMM.......\n\n I tend to favour perfumes that are polar opposites really; on the one hand, I enjoy tooth achingly sweet scents (Pink Sugar is a favourite), and on the other, I have a passion for rich, warm spicy stuff, like Tabu and my new friend, Youth Dew.  Angel falls somewhere in the middle.  This is rich, sweet incense, dense, dirty patch and the darkest of dark chocolate. It's glorious.  I f*#!ing love it.  Saving up for a full bottle as of now.\n\nWhat a beauty.  If I had a tail, I'd have wagged it right off.", "45": "My dear Angel...\nOdi et amo, quare id faciam, fortasse requiris.\n\u00b4Cause sometimes you make me sick.\nAnd sometimes you make me beg for more.\nDon\u00b4t blame it on me - blame it on the damn combination of dark chocolate, sticky caramel, and earthy patchouli.\nI love it. \nAnd I can\u00b4t stand it.\nThat\u00b4s why I\u00b4m leaving you. \nThat\u00b4s why I\u00b4m coming back for more.\nYes, I know, nobody said it was easy.\nBut I love complicated relationships.\nSo, I promise I\u00b4ll try harder to understand you.\nIt\u00b4s worth it.\nSo... See you in winter - because I wanna fall in love with you again...", "46": "I\u2019m a man and I wear Angel with pride. The 30% of patchouli oil cuts the candied notes more than enough to make this unisex. Lucky patchouli is my favorite scent! (Please wear what you love with pride regardless. Confidence is very attractive) To me this smells of a care free fun time. Angel reminds me growing up down the Jersey Shore. Specifically walking the boardwalk at night. (Yes like Snooki\u2019s old stomping grounds) All the scents combined including the smoke from the grills, salt water taffy, cotton candy, ice cream, Italian Ice fruit flavor syrups and the amazing chocolate shops. Mr. Cresp has said that he learned how to create the scents of honey, dark chocolate, cocoa and praline from a flavorist in Jersey at the start of his professional career. I\u2019m not sure if he took possible inspiration from shared experience\u2019s. However I assure you that he nailed the scent of Seaside Height\u2019s boardwalk growing up. Very emotionally connected with this fragrance. Rest In Peace Manfred Mugler \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udcab", "47": "Dearest Angel, \n\nMy God, you are a Divine drama queen!\nYou take centre stage and you deserve the spotlight\nYou also deserve the polarizing reviews: The praising fans and the passionate haters. Because on some you are a revelation, on others, repelling. \nDespite it all, You are THE star of the show, and you make everything else pale in comparison.\n\n-Hence, Angel does not work well with the faint of heart or anyone seeking a fresh, sweet and inoffensive scent.\nAngel can definitely be offensive, but anything truly fabulous has off-putting elements to balance the sweetness.\n\nHowever: Do NOT wear Angel on days where you just wanna blend in with the crowd or go unnoticed.\nYou have to look fierce to pull Her off, otherwise you misrepresent both her and yourself.\n\nAfter 45 min of harshness/patchouli bombing, Angel dries down to a glorious, mature scent. And yes, she has a rare longevity; she stays with the wearer all day long. \nAngel unfolds her beautiful wings throughout the day and like a little fairy, she spreads angel dust all around her wearer like glitter.  She leaves a luscious trail behind her, and little whiffs of delicious chocolate, caramel and warm vanilla + sandalwood will follow you until the day has passed.\n(She is feminine by heart, but complex to an extend that a fabulously stylish man; straight, queer, gay, could pull her off as well.)\n\nAngel is in essence a dichotomy: Either she is a beautifully complex dream or else she's a dreadful nightmare, depending on how she settles with your skin chemistry.\nHowever, I must say, that my vintage Angel EDP has a much more smooth and luxurious feel from the first spray, whereas the current formulations are much more harsh and aggressive within the first hour. Despite this; The core of the fragrance is very similar to the original formulation. You just have to be a little patient to let her unfold.\nSo if you don't have the opportunity to get your hands on a vintage bottle, then please: \nDo not dump Angel before giving her a chance well past the first hour (!!)\nBe mindful, that she's unique and can be an acquired taste, so try her on for a couple of days in a row.\nIf your skin chemistry doesn't repel this scent after the dry down, then she could truly become your Holy Grail scent.\nJust spray her in moderation and while you're going about your morning routine = well before you leave your house, otherwise she can be off-putting to some of your colleagues/surroundings.\n\nBut know this:\nOnce you've been put under her angelic spell, you'll realize:\nHer Divine drydown is well worth the initial journey through hell and purgatory.", "48": "My relationship with Angel is like that one Tvtropes trope \u201cslap, slap, kiss\u201d. \n\nI tried this several times on paper and thought it was horrifying. Like if you put a chocolate fountain inside a cumin filled Indian restaurant. Chocolate on it\u2019s own is alright, and Indian food is great. The combination? Not something I want to smell like. However instead of keeping away I was fascinated. I kept coming back to it, smelling it, and then flinching every time I smelled it. I think I kept coming back because it didn\u2019t smell like all the other vanilla musk gourmands and fruity concoctions on the shelves which always made me respect this fragrance. \n\nEventually I reached a point where I finally built up the courage to spray it on my skin. I do think this is the sort of scent that needs skin. On my skin this is chocolate buried under tons of patchouli (the real, dirty smelling stuff, not the smoothed over patch most fragrances use nowadays). And I kind of loved it? Something about the juxtaposition of sweet gourmand with dirty was such a fascinating mix that still keeps me intrigued. I don\u2019t wear this very often because its strength is nuclear and I don\u2019t want to fumigate people around me, but this scent is one I respect and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s around.", "49": "You gave us an Angel...

It doesn't have any off-putting notes (the Dua one has this weird smell). The quality is insane. It is like a magical journey. From the initial spray, I felt really bad about never trying this one before... The hype is so real. \nThe only downside is the pricing. This fragrance is INCREDIBLY expensive.\nFrom tomorrow, I will be selling all of my clones to buy a 15 ml decant of this, which will be enough for me for months.\nThis is Francis Kurkdjian's masterpiece, after creating the best fragrances in the industry, for over 25 years, his art has reached its final form. \nWell done. 10/10 \nEdit: Performance-wise, the longevity, especially on the clothing is eternal.

Spray my sample on my suits and have them smell like BR540 extrait untill 2020", "4": "I respectfully disagree with the reviewer below me - Cloud is very much alike BR540 Extrait. I'm confused as to how not everyone agrees with that. I have bought several sample packs straight from the MFK website because I was very interested in the house and every time, I have gotten a sample of BR540 Extrait. I've tried it many times and I definitely have a legit one. This is one of those few times where a dupe starts out very different to the one it is meant to imitate, in my experience its usually the other way around, they start out similar but then end up being world's apart. Not the case with BR540 Extrait and Cloud.  \nCloud is more fruity in the beginning, more immature, bright and the whipped cream note is very noticeable. BR540 Extrait starts out a lot woodier. If you are comparing them to one another at this stage and for the first 30 minutes or so, then yes, I can understand that you don't think they're that much alike. But once the cheap fruits and whipped cream calm down in Cloud, that's where they start to morph into one. Right now as I'm writing this I have BR540 Extrait on one arm and Cloud on the other. After the 30 minute mark I have a hard time distinguishing between the two. Cloud is considerably less intense and doesn't leave a huge trail, its less woody and there is a trace of cheery fruits and whipped cream. BR540 Extrait is more complex when you stick your nose in it and inhale. But when I catch whiffs off of myself I'm not sure which arm it came from. So what is projecting around me smells very similar indeed. Are they exactly the same? No of course not, they are two different fragrances. But, in my opinion, sillage is very similar. \nBR540 Extrait is beautiful. In no way, shape or form am I calling it cheap by likening it to Cloud. I'm more so saying that Cloud was well executed. I won't go into details about what BR540 Extrait smells like, as many people have done a superb job of that already, but it is indeed a work of art. You may or may not like it, but both BR540 Eau de Parfum and BR540 Eau de Parfum Extrait were groundbreaking when they first came out. And I heavily dislike the Eau de Parfum, the latex/dentist smell overpowers it completely but the perfect harmony was found the Extrait. But I still recognise the impact they've had on the fragrance world and I respect the work behind them. \nThere is something so luxurious and special about having the original. Bottles are beautiful and the scent is magical. If you've fallen for it head over heels then you should get it. I always recommend to save up and get what you've fallen for instead of choosing a similar one to save money. You'll always be craving the one you truly want so it's better to be patient and get your love and not settle.\nBut for those who happen to either really like it or just love it but it's not IT (by that I mean it's not THE fragrance that makes your heart sing in a very special way even if you love it) then you may want to consider Cloud. I fall into the category of love it but not-my-fragrance-soulmate-love-it so I was on the fence. And for now I've decided that Cloud is enough for me. That may change but for now I'm happy. \nI'm guessing a lot of people may not want to find similarities in a cheap celebrity fragrance and their expensive niche work of art. I understand that very well. It's not as much fun when you've found something that you absolutely love, that costs a lot and makes you feel special, only for it to become copied and mass produced and overly popular.  \nOf course, each nose is different and all that, but I still stand firmly behind my opinion in this debate. \nOh, and Burberry Her in comparison? Nope, my sister wears that one and Cloud as well, and I can tell them apart when I smell her. Burberry Her is a lot fruitier than both BR540 and Cloud. Still similar, but not as much as the other two. \nIs BR540 Extrait worth the money?

I enjoyed it enough that here I am, 4 days later, writing a review on fragrantica. Ask yourself if anyone would do that for an underperforming, dated fragrance.

Any good fragrance gets over worn and then it\u2019s less exciting that all. There\u2019s Aventus remakes, GIT remakes, and actual over hyped fragrances everywhere but if you tell someone that has no cares for fragrance to smell aventus they may say ew... but none of the above for Gio and Armani\u2019s own Profumo is metallic incense sharp disaster that doesn\u2019t develop right. Gio has gotten me the absolute most and best reactions and compliments of all.

It\u2019s common as hell but who cares, there\u2019s a reason, it\u2019s a modern classic. I stopped wearing it for years because people will tell you \u201coh it\u2019s so common, it\u2019s so played out,\u201d but I regret ever listening to that nonsense and not wearing this.

Two thumbs way up!", "11": "Wow there are a lot of reviews for this. More buried reviews than many scents got actual reviews. I will choose my words carefully so as not to be redundant...\n\nI was born in the 60s, schooled in the 70s, came of age during the 80s, and went on my own path and matured in the 90s...subsequently, my signature scents were PS Fine Cologne, Colors for men by Benetton, Drakkar Noir/Dynamik by Guy LaRouche, and finally Acqua di Gio.  Now granted I did not know mush about fragrance other than Mom wore Chanel No5, and Dad wore Old Spice and English Leather...the above progression was one I'm sure many people follow or at least a very similar track because you don't know what you like until you find it, and these frags were EVERYWHERE. Now with a collection in the triple digits, yes there are other fragrances more complex, more original and much more expensive and less known yet AdG is a special fragrance to myself and apparently alot of others for reasons listed above and there are times when nothing else will do...\n\nAdG from the notes in it seems like it should be a reeking jumble of rankness yet Alberto Morillas took all these essences blended and fine tuned them into a magnificent symphony of scent. The opening prelude is citric-aquatic yet hints at whats to come with a light blast of  sweetness and incensed mossy woods. This prelude ends quickly as it returns to the citrus sections lead with a forte overture joined by the slightly peachy persimmon and backed by lilting neroli blossoms as the next phase gets stronger with sharp and watery herbs like rosemary and corriander. The floral section builds with nastutium, hyacinth and mignonette (the main floral in L'eau de Issey pH). These join in the same key but play a slightly diffent tune still in accord with the citrus and calone. As the top and heart sections return to the same page the deep basenotes begin to grow with amber, patchouli and moss forming the main theme as aromatic cedar and a very clean musk play on and remind one of cistus resins. This piece continues for quite some time changing slightly now and again yet remaining ever sweet, clean, fresh and oh so Mediterranean. This is not surprising since Giorgio (GIO to his friends) was inspired to this by summers at his Italian villa.\nYes, it is everywhere and on everyone and has been for a decade and a half, but it is for a reason...its a truly sublime creation that is clean (but not soapy), aquatic (but never watery) and masculine (despite many fruits and florals) and just sweet enough to entice yet never cloying or sickening (in moderation). I haven't worn it for a while because I smell it so much but this is what I reach for when I want a refined, clean complex fragrance. Its fans far outnumber its detractors so it never causes a STINK...and above all it is sexy while being neither femme or butch. A TRUE MASTERPIECE!!!\n\nSillage: Fantastic\nLongevity: Above average\nOverall: 5/5   Perfect\n\nJust becuse you've heard Beethoven's 5th a million times and everyone knows it doesn't diminish its perfection or mean it should be tossed out in favor of the Beatles White Album...both are exquisite classics.

Even today in my rotation and what fantastic memories it brings me.", "13": "Honestly, why does anyone consider the scent of this one as \"nauseating\"? I mean, which part of it that nauseates you? I personally love the slight scent of ocean on the drydown. Such signature, very refreshing.", "14": "I like the fact that this smells exactly the same now, as the 12 year old sample i dug out a few weeks ago.  I'm definitely not a fan of many Armani fragrances, code in fact makes me feel physically sick.  But ADG is no natural smelling, a truly beautiful fragrance which develops very well on the skin, the base is a truly warm glowing amber/wood smell which i really love.  A true classic.\n\nQuick update. 8 Hours later and it still smells fabulous, albeit within arms length, good longevity for an EDT", "15": "I avoided trying this frag for a while because I had a preconceived notion that it would smell generic or too similar to 3475426130 other scents, but I was wrong. Maybe other Fragranticans spend more time than me sniffing people, but I haven't smelled Acqua di Gio on too many other folks. It may be one of the \"safer\" colognes out there, but I don't think it deserves all the bad press that it gets.\n\nYou won't lose your credibility as a fraghead just because you like this. If fragrances were chocolate, AdG would be a Snickers bar. Everybody knows about it, and some prefer more refined options like Godiva or Lindt, but Snickers is a tried and true classic like AdG that a lot of people love.", "16": "I agree that there are many citrus scents out there thaat resemble this one that can be bought at much lower prices but, then again- as a woman, whenever I smell this one, I turn my head to see the man who is wearing it.

It has a garnered fame, and wrath as having become too generic to be worn. \n\n   I'll admit, as a cologne seller, at first I wasn't crazy about this cologne simply because it was hyped so much by guys who look like they just graduated high school, and were on their way to the dorm. And because of its generic, oft-replicated (never duplicated) smell.  \n\n  However, as I have worn it, I have come to appreciate both its smooth opening and its sweet and subtle dry down which retains a wonderful fruity/woodsy and ocean reminiscence. I have tried DG light blue, CK One and a number of other obvious attempts at its crown, and have found them all woefully shallow. \n\n  Without expounding further (which I could)I see why this cologne has set the bar. Women come by my counter just to smell it. Therefore, I wear it. \n\n8.5/10", "28": "My all time favorite cologne! Aqua Di Gio is a classic clean scent that is perfect for all age groups.

Yet in the 1 sec that people get to smell you- it stops them for a moment. \n\nI have had many perfumes, which are so complex that they leave you trying to dig up what the notes are yet hardly receives any notice / complements. \n\nMy most complemented fragrance of all time, followed by CK escape, Tom ford black orchid", "30": "If you are under the age of 25, there is a small chance that this fragrance played a role in your creation.  That sounds funny to say, but it's no joke.  That's how amazing and seductive this fragrance was in the late 90's to the mid 2000s.\nThis IMO was the most perfect fragrance ever.  Its versatility was off the charts.  You could wear it to school.  You could wear it to work.  You could wear it to the club.  You could wear it on a date.  You could wear it formal.  You could wear it in informal.  You could wear it while at the gym or playing a sport.  This fragrance also had a perfect projection/sillage.  You could smell this fragrance on a person 5 ft away and it wouldn't be obnoxious.  Like the post below me if you found yourself in the scent trail it was captivating.  There is a reason this fragrance is considered one of, if not the best fragrance ever created.\nIf you can ever find a pre 2007 formulation do not hesitate, buy it immediately.  You won't regret it.", "31": "I bought this one for my boyfriend without having ever smelled it - I went in blind because he's a fan of CK One, so I thought ADG would be right up his street. He actually liked it and wears it everyday. Now, the one thing I found surprising is that nobody remarks on the strong flowers in this fragrance. I don't know if it's his skin or our nose, but the main element for me when he sprays this on is FREESIAS -which I absolutely love- not citrus or anything else. It's a very attractive smell, such a flowery aroma in a masculine fragrance.\nWhenever I come back home, before I even get on the elevator, I can tell if he's recently left or come back, because I get this whiff of freesia in the hall. I quite recommend this one!", "32": "I love fresh, aquatic scents. I love to wear them; I love spraying them on my clothes and linens; I love to smell them on other people\u2014especially men. Luxury label Armani\u2019s Acqua Di Gio has become ubiquitous in the fragrance world as the ultimate men\u2019s freshie of our times. Given my dislike or at least disappointment with so many \u201cviral\u201d scents, I approached this particular cologne with caution. However, Acqua Di Gio lives up to its reputation\u2014it really is a lovely scent.\n\nIt\u2019s clean, sweet, piquant, fresh and full bodied. I like that it incorporates many florals, if rather subtly, in its heart and top notes. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised that Armani managed to make the indolic and overtly sexy notes of neroli and jasmine smell fresh, soothing and even a little masculine, though the sharp citrus notes help. One of my favorite watery floral notes, hyacinth, plays out strongly here. The lovely earthy and herbaceous green notes of rosemary and patchouli can be detected even in the dry down. I don\u2019t get a lot of musk here, not on my card or skin\u2014which is fine by me.\n\nAlthough marketed as a men\u2019s fragrance, I would argue that it could work as unisex. The only downside is that it\u2019s just so ubiquitous that it could come across as generic. But sometimes uniqueness is overrated\u2014some things are popular for a reason, and Acqua Di Gio has a very good reason for being as popular as it is.", "33": "I bought this blind today, and after reading the reviews I don't understand how it can be given so many negative reviews due to it's popularity. Surely the idea of a scent is to smell good? And Acqua di Gio is more than good, it's an amazing scent. I can fully understand why women would love this on a man. This is so fresh it's like walking from the Mediterranean Sea James Bond style, and putting on your white linen trousers, crisp blue cotton shirt and brown Bally loafers for an evening meal in the marina, watching the sunset behind the huge yachts rocking softly on the waves. \n\nAcqua di Gio will go down as an all time classic scent, and deserves to be in everymans bathroom cabinet.

In fact, I gave a nearly full bottle to my brother-in-law because I couldn't stand it anymore.\n\nMy wife always loved it though, so I picked up a bottle recently. It was a weird and unexpected experience. It smells nothing like I remember. Absolutely nothing. And it's not like I don't remember what it smells like. I smell it on guys all the time and recognize it immediately. But today, on my skin, there's no trace of familiarity or nostalgia. Maybe it's due to reformulation, maybe it's due to the fact that my tastes and perspectives have changed over the course of almost 20 years. Whatever the case, I'm delighted to make the re-discovery. It's easy to understand why this has become such as classic. Wonderfully balanced, fresh, and invigorating. I love it all over again!!", "36": "True story... I have never smelled AdG before in my life. I have always avoided it due to its reputation and overuse. Well that changed when I received a bottle today.

Good luck! \n10/10", "38": "Many people are hating on the reformulation but personally I love it.

I recently bought it for myself again after smelling a sample and remembering how much I loved this scent, it's perfect for the office, hangouts, summer days, or evening dinners. There's a reason this has been around for so long and it is such a staple piece in the mens fragrance community. If I had a son (I'm 23 for reference), or a friend who wasn't really into fashion or self-appearance, I would buy them this as a starter. This would be a fantastic gift for a close friend or male family member.

Interestingly, Acqua di Gio is a complex scent where I cannot distinguish the notes. Normally, in other perfumes, I can. This one is an exception.\n\nA note - although I am a woman, I have been using this perfume myself, too! It does not feel like a masculine scent on my skin, it is just a fresh, unisex thing when I wear it. \n\n\nAll in all, I just love this perfume. On men and on women, it is more a question of whether it suits you.", "43": "One of the best male perfumes to use everyday.

What is interesting about this is that I had sprayed AdG 6 hours earlier.\nBecause its high price, after finishing my bottle of Acqua di Gi\u00f2, I tried some \"cheap copies\" as Just Me by Paris Hilton and Unbound by Halston. After that, what can I say is beside the diferences between them, I found Acqua di Gi\u00f2 much better.\nI don't care if many guys are wearing AdG, if it is too common.

It's perfect for daily wear, not over powering to the point of getting dizzy or nauseous.

All three clearly smell like AdG and are about 90-95% similar if I had to put up a %. I'd say the newest formulation is leaning unisex or actually easily unisex and the other 2 are a bit more manly, but not in a macho-man way. Differences in smell are easier to notice up close as opposed to in the air. \n\nVintage batch or newest batch are the ones to get. They all smell 10/10, but if it says Pour Homme on the bottle and box and isn't vintage, it's a weak sauce :/ \n\nSo vintage = masculine, zingy citrus aquatic, slightly more similar to AdG profumo than the other batches, average performance for a freshie\n\nNewest formulation = unisex, soft citrus aquatic, average performance for a freshie\n\nPour Homme batch (non-vintage) = masculine leaning unisex, zingy citrus aquatic, bad performance perfect for the gym or short errands \n\nPersonally I prefer the newest batches.

Highly recommend, one of my favourite vanillas that I have tried, and i'm excited to try other Kayali fragrances.", "1": "I'm going to preface this review by saying that I don't come from an affectionate family. \nBut I do have three younger brothers in the teen to early twenties age range. \nThey're the awkward type that show love by randomly bringing me food or showing me something they thought was cool and walking right away.  \nBut when I sprayed this fragrance? I sprayed it on the back of my neck/shoulder just once to test it out. Just sitting there scrolling on my phone when a couple of my brothers walked in for something and ended up sitting next to me to snoop on what I was watching.  \nAnd these boys basically crushed me because they kept leaning into me. They ended up laying their heads on my shoulders and I could hear them sniffing me like crazy. (yes, it was weird. I didn't wanna move because I was afraid I'd spook them like a sleeping cat)  \nThey thankfully got called down for dinner, but then my other brother came in and did the SAME THING. I don't think they even realized they were doing it.  \nTo a normal family that might not seem out of the ordinary, but I was floored. Honestly flabbergasted.  \nBut this smells phenomenal to me too, which is a huge plus. And I don't normally like predominantly vanilla fragrances. Cheapie for the win! When you can find it in stock lol", "2": "Oh, this is gorgeous! Boozy, warm, sweet...intoxicating.  \nI ordered a decant of this and at first spray, I thought it was just \"plain vanilla.\" After just a few minutes, the scent settles into a warm, deep vanilla with maybe a hint of smoke. I don't get floral or musk. This smells like ACTUAL vanilla, not synthetic. It's a grown-up vanilla. I love that there's no fruit here.  \nThis heady scent lasts for quite some time...enveloping me for at least 6 hours. After that, it's softer, but still there. I want to bury my nose in it. This morning, I can still smell it on my wrist!  \nThis reminds me of Laurence Dumont Vanille Oriental that Sephora carried back in the day. Definitely buying the full bottle! \nETA: full bottle purchased!", "3": "Chile!!!! THIS FRAGRANCE IS 100% OVERHYPED. Just like with MOST things on tik tok that people get ahold of and blow to extreme proportions. It's really a sheep instinct. Anywho off my soapbox, for what it is this fragrance is nice. But me being a true gourmand lover I was expecting more everytime someone said this was the BEST vanilla gourmand fragrance ever. It's not. There's a lot more of a floral scent in this that balances with the brown sugar and tonka bean to make a more rounded out classy sophisticated sweet scent. It smells like florals before anything AND THEN you get like a warm heated up brown sugar. The way people described this I was expecting warm vanilla extract, gooey caramelized brown sugar, and heavy tonka bean with a sprinkle of white floral. Um no. That being said this perfume gets better as it ages. Fresh out of the box your juice will be a light brown color. After a few months of sitting you will see some color change as with a lot of vanilla fragrances and it will get darker from settling. I feel like then it gets a bit better and you get more warmth and sweetness. It's a great layering agent as I tend to call it the razzle dazzle perfume. As soon as I add this fragrance to any other gourmand it amplifies it and makes the gourmand better. It's my understanding that these fragrances were indeed made to layer, whether within the fragrance house or with others so maybe that's why it was concocted the way it is. I say definitely buy a sample first ESPECIALLY if you're a true gourmand lover because your nose may be disappointed when it first gets on this. Try layering it a few times and also maybe even let it sit. And by the time you're done with the sample you'll know if you need this or not. If you're missing it or not, if it'll be great to layer with or not.", "4": "Oh my god. The people comparing this to cheap body sprays are not doing it any justice (and I don't smell any of those comparisons other than the fact that they have a vanilla note). I don't like VS bare vanilla or the like, but I love this so don't let those reviews deter you. \nAt first I didn't understand the hype - how could a basic vanilla be so expensive and permanently sold out? I got many other vanilla perfumes before I gave this a shot and let me tell you ..... I get the hype! It's vanilla based but don't underestimate the florals which make it more \"adult\" and sexy. I'm obsessed. Is it basic? yes. Is it mysterious and cool? no. But do I love it? yes."}, "53": {"0": "Grand Soir is beautiful.

I received a sample from a perfume boutique around 7 months ago then promptly forgot about it. On this warm August day, I found the sample slightly thickened in the tester with a few visible particles. I proceeded to place a few drops of this lovely amber oil on each forearm and in back and front of my neck. As I left for work in the morning warmth, I was impressed that Grand Soir was approximating the tenacity of a perfume oil. I easily identified the resin and vanilla within the rich cloud of amber. The real treat came later when I began to catch whiffs of pi\u00f1on. You must travel the Southwest United States to know pi\u00f1on, a sweet pine, and once you do it will enchant your dreams forever. It only occurred to me later that the pi\u00f1on was my Grand Soir. Not an intentional note, surely, but I'll take my pi\u00f1on burning in a desert hearth under a starry night sky over benzoin whenever I can get it. \nI don't remember being quite so in love with Grand Soir that day at the boutique, though it was one of the four I asked to take home. My nose was also fatigued by the time it was developing on my skin. On the other hand, I wonder if my little sample of Grand Soir just aged incredibly well and left me with an absolute I won't be able to purchase. After today, I can't wait to get my hands on more to find out.", "3": "There are some fragrance categories that I no longer gravitate toward as a consumer, not because I no longer enjoy scents of that type, but specifically because I've purchased a fragrance that, to my nose, is the best possible example of its particular classification, and I'm just not interested in trying to improve upon it. For me, in the case of ambers, Grand Soir is that fragrance.  \nIt's what I think of as \"textbook\" in the genre, and quite apart from my usual preferences, it's completely safe, not particularly daring or dark, unchallenging, and has zero rough edges, but even still, it has more or less closed the door on amber scents for my foreseeable future. And I'm okay with that. There is admittedly something sort of bittersweet to the arrival of that moment since it means that a particular leg of the fragrance journey has come to a close, but ultimately I think it's really important to take a step back every now and then to admit when you're completely satisfied with something. The term \"holy grail\" gets tossed around far too much in these instances, and I think descriptions like that turn a collecting hobby into something more serious than it needs to be. I'd offer up \"finish line\" instead. \nGS is a syrupy amber, which is what I gravitate toward. It feels as though you're dripping in amber. However, that may not be the specific vibe you're looking for, and if that's the case, more power to you. For a more pillowy amber, MPEG's Ambre Precieux is excellent, and if the idea of amber conjures up dryer connotations for you, Fort & Manle's Amber Absolutely is worth a try (although I own the original formulation in the black bottle and cannot attest to the quality of the new stuff). But for me, this is where the sidewalk ends on amber, and I'm happy with that. It feels good to reach a destination in a hobby that so often feels like a hamster wheel. \nThis one's a 10, no question.", "4": "Not sure why the YouTube people say so much about baccarat.

It has moderate to heavy sillage and quite long lasting.", "18": "After hearing soooo much praise about this fragrance in the Facebook groups, I finally went ahead and bought a sample. The people were right, it smells pretty great. I don't think I'll buy a full bottle though, my sample should suffice, but overall I'm not mad I got it.\n\nAnyway, the reason I'm writing this here isn't necessarily to add yet another redundant positive review to this scent's already long list...but rather, I want to help out anyone who hasn't smelled it yet and who might be curious about how it smells. Well, I guess this only works if you're Hispanic/Latino or very familiar with Hispanic foods, but anyway, this kinda smells like how horchata tastes. If you've ever tried that drink before (basically, rice milk with cinnamon and vanilla), that flavor should put you in the ballpark of how this fragrance smells.

The list of ambers this fragrance defeats begins with Ambre Nuit, Ambre 114 and ends with Ex Nihilo's Amber Sky and Ambra Avrea. Very few frags succeed to deliver this opulence, luxury and sensuality. \nI recon this is the best amber in the market. I would have hoped that the projection was somewhat stronger. But, honestly, that gives me an excuse to overspray this beauty and enjoy this amazing blending.\n\nGreat job mister Kurkdjian, you are indeed a genius masterperfumer. I sincerely wish you would invest your time and talent on such offerings and not on mediocre offerings such as the aquas.", "20": "This is not a review, I want to elaborate on ba21 comments. Back in the day, companies were still trying to establish their mark in the industry. My personal opinion is that when you buy the orginal version 99.99%  they'll produce a high quality fragrance to get your attention. Once sales are established some companies will tweak the notes by replacing the note with a substitute... I call this a \"filler\". A filler is likely of a lower synthetic product to extend the aroma. Most of the ingredients used are very costly. If these companies continue to use the same level of quality ingredients, the price will go up because of supply and demand. \nThink, why are vintage purfumes more expensive? Not all are discontinued, rather the ingredients are more refined and more expensive to harvest. \nNo company will admit that this is what they're doing. Not only is it misleading and fraudulent, more so it would tarnish the brand name which is why you bought the fragrance in the first place.\nWhen companies notice that their sales are going down, they'll need to adjust their price by lowering it or increasing it and bringing back some of the original notes to try and win you back.\nConsidering what you're paying for a niche fragrance, the quality should never go down. \nI do have this fragrance, when I post it, I'll let everyone know what batch number I own.\nShop carefully and do your homework by seeing how long the purfume/cologne has been out on the market. \nGood luck", "21": "It made me think why the hell I am spending all that money on other frags when I have this. Beautiful beautiful smell.", "22": "Fragrance notes like amber and rose are deep notes. So I like them when they sit deep in the background and act as a base for the other notes. Ironically, I completely dislike fragrances that feature these notes as main players and in the front line.\n\nGrand Soir opens with amber up front, very similar to Serge Lutens Ambre Sultan, albeit less spicy in the opening. I was not impressed by it at all. \"Cool. Nice realistic amber. But not my cup of tea\" was my thought in the first 15 minutes.\n\nI got home and I took an afternoon nap. I woke up 2 hours later to this addicting sweet scent radiating at full strength from my wrist. The amber was pushed back to the background and I was smelling the warmest, most masculine vanilla I've ever smelled. Coupled with benzoin and labdanum, it was one of the most narcotic experiences I've ever had with a fragrance. \n\n\nTo put my reaction to it's dry down into perspective, imagine someone saying \"you smell nice\" with a normal smile when they smell your cologne. Now imagine someone with a dropped jaw, staring at you with wide open eyes, saying \"is that you ?\".\nMe on that day, and everyone who has smelled this on me since has been the latter.\n\nI mostly wear Creed when I want to impress people around me.

Besides Grand Soir, I chose BR540, BR540 Extrait and Oud Satin Mood. First things first, the quality and refinement from MFK is unsurpassed. BR540, in particular, has been duped countless times, but nothing has come even close to the original creation from the master himself. MFK's creations are high quality, timeless and make almost anyone feel so sophisticated. \n\nMy interest in Grand Soir was initially triggered by the hype it has received from the online fragrance community. I usually take the opinions of all those 'influencers' with a grain of salt, but with Grand Soir I can say the hype is  REAL. I never expected a perfume with just two main accords to be so captivating, but here I am, falling in love with this amber-vanilla bomb. Grand Soir does not evolve much after you spray it on, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Some perfumes are brilliant because of their simplicity. GS just exudes warmth, coziness and a slight smokiness for 8 hours straight (on my skin), which makes it perfect for the colder days (and nights). It is perfectly unisex as welI. I would love to smell this on any men or woman. Very sexy. Thank you, Mr. Kurkdjian for this masterpiece. You have gained yourself a (not so secret) admirer.", "28": "Some of the reviewers here should be banned from free speech. Unadulterated idiocy.

Rich and opulent, it just screams \"quality\". It's a very warm scent, very sweet, and slightly medicine-y thanks to the benzoin. Others have called it linear and/or somewhat simple, and I can kind of see where they're coming from, but to me it's literal perfection.

Soft yet intoxicating. \n\nThe notes blend so beautifully into each other, the amber and labdanum are soft, spicy and distinctly resinous. A little like expensive Frankincense and Violin Rosin. Then a gorgeous trio of benzoin, tonka bean and vanilla all add sexy creaminess and inviting skin scent which adds just the perfect tiny touch of sweetness to balance it all. \n\nIt smells like you just had the best sex of your life in the orchestra pit of the Royal Opera House.", "33": "It seems simple reading the notes, there is a bit missing imo, Its not a over complicated perfume but is very dens and rich.

The warm, cosy, lightly sweet, delicious pairing of amber and vanilla is spiced up by tonka, benzoin and labdanum. I do not understand the reviewers below who question the unisex tag.

Very unisex, sweet, boozy like smell that surrounds you with a bubble. It is not screaming, it is very subtle though. The projection is moderate but with such type of smell I prefer to be discreet because, if it's too strong, it sooner or later will become irritating for people around the wearer. Longevity? Superb in my case. I sprayed myself at 18:00, took a shower at 23:00 and could still detect in the morning.  The opening smells of beeswax on me, very sweet with some spices. After 30 minutes it becomes mellowy ambery and honey-like. Absolutely cozy scent. It is elegant but you can pull it off in basically any outfit except for a t-shirt and tracksuit. Polo shirt and chinos? Enough in my opinion. Is it worth the price? 150$ for 70 ml where I live. Yes and no. Yes because it's well-blended, elegant and not common. No, because it's just perfume. But we love perfume, don't we? So go ahead and buy it! In my opinion way better for men than Baccarat Rouge which is nice but I don't see myself wearing it. Ordered a bottle today. Can't wait until I receive it. I don't expect to receive compliments. It's a scent for me, myself and I.", "38": "I will start off by saying this: I was sent a sample in a swap....Upon first application, I immediately went on and bought a bottle. \n\nI was initially blown away by the benzoin, and just how it mixed with the amber. It was honestly dirty, weird & odd but sooo satisfying. I have never smelled anything like it. \n\n\"Interesting\" was the correct word to use on my first wearing. I couldn't figure out if it was too feminine for me, or if it was just good enough to use no-matter-what. \n\nI came to the conclusion that it was, \"Too good not to buy.\" So I bought it. \n\nThe opening is just so oddly pleasing. I cant get enough of the benzoin. It's so different, but so dang uplifting in a really warm and unique way. The warmth and coziness hugs your senses and instantly increases happiness. \n\nAs it settles down, the benzoin fades and allows the vanilla to dance with the amber.....Yes, its as good as it sounds. \n\nNow, it's not the best thing every created. Once the benzoin fades it feels a bit linear, however it is just a phenomenal warm, inviting, comforting and amazing amber/vanilla frag. \n\nGlad I bought it.", "39": "This is blowing me away. It is rapidly skyrocketing to the top of my all-time bests list. I figured I would like it based on the notes - so many of my favorite things - but this is not like I'm feeling, it's love. It is an ambery, tonka, spicy evening scent on me. The vanilla is there, but not in the foreground. It is mostly providing a lovely softness.\n\nUpdate #1: This is a monster. Even if I just handle the sample vial, I will smell it on my fingertips for hours or until I wash my hands VERY THOROUGHLY. It\u2019s like a good coronavirus reminder about proper hand hygiene.\n\nUpdate #2: On every third or fourth wearing - not all the time - this will get a harsh-but-stale note that smells a lot like the smell of cloves cigarettes lingering on someone\u2019s clothing in the hamper.

The amber feels resinous, slightly woody, earthy, mildly sweet; the vanilla, tonka, and benzoin create an intense and aromatic accord that is evocative of a sweet and fine vanilla dessert. The labdanum contributes to more ambery accords. The fragrance is relatively linear, all notes come up and continue into the dry-down. Once the fragrance has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a very sweet, amber, vanilla, and tonka fragrance. The fragrance feels comforting, cozy, delectable, gourmand, mature, mild, modern, resinous, very sweet, syrupy, unisex, warm, and very pleasant.\n\nBATCH REVIEWED: 2020\nWOW RATING: 7/10. The combination of amber, vanilla, and tonka are great but not outstanding.\nDISLIKE RATING: 1/10. The amber is a very neutral note that is unlikely to come across as offensive.\nUNIQUENESS: 8/10. Pure amber fragrances like this one are not common.\nMASS APPEAL: 5/10. Amber is not a high mass-appeal accord.\nPROJECTION: 3/10. Moderate, about 3 feet around the wearer.\nSILLAGE: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 or more feet behind the wearer.\nAPPLICATION: Four atomizations will suffice. Additional atomizations will not make the fragrance offensive but will improve longevity.\nLONGEVITY: 5/10. About 5 hours with 2 hours of good projection.\nSEASONS: Winter, fall. Colder days or temperature-controlled environments.\nOCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office, casual, holidays. This is an office-friendly fragrance.\nVERSATILITY: 5/10. As a neutral accord, the amber fits well on many occasions, especially during the colder months.\nGENDER: Unisex. The amber is a neutral accord found in masculine and feminine fragrances. The second most prominent note is vanilla, which is also a neutral tone.\nAGES: 30 and above.\nRECOMMENDATION: Maison Francis Kurkdjian Grand Soir is a great and refined ambery fragrance. It can be found discounted for approximately $200, and it is ideal for those that enjoy sweet ambery fragrances.\nBLIND-BUY: No. Sample it first.\nSIMILAR: These are some examples. Issey Miyake - Noir Ambre is a great amber fragrance but difficult to find; Dior - Ambre Nuit is another good example; Mancera Amber Fever contains sweet, amber, and boozy accords; Montale Blue Amber is a fantastic amber fragrance.\nSUMMARY: A very sweet, amber, vanilla, and tonka fragrance. The fragrance feels comforting, cozy, delectable, gourmand, mature, mild, modern, resinous, very sweet, syrupy, unisex, warm, and very pleasant.", "48": "The best word i can describe this with is BALANCED. Everything just seems so well constructed, the ratios of the notes feels perfect TO ME. I can understand if someone may not like it. The benzoin and amber work really well imo and the vanilla gives it great gourmand like vibe. This to me is one of the best niche vanillas out there, personally I prefer this over SDV from Guerlain not just because of the price, but also cause it has better performance and a less generic vanilla smell to it.\n\nScent: 9.5/10\nPerformance: 8/10\n\nTL;DR\nExcellent vanilla/benzoin amber that is well blended with good performance.

It makes me feel calm and happy.  \nWarm, fluffy, powdery and slightly ever so slightly sweet.  \nI will never be without this one", "1": "I don't understand some of the reviewers and fellow perfume lovers who make it sound like a perfume that is \"easy and lovable\" is a bad one.  \nMon Guerlain is beautiful, easy, creamy, poudery vanilla. Not at all hard to smell. Not \"headeachy\". And that is essential for me. I don't want a perfume to challenge me or make me disagree with myself trying to find out whether I like it or not.  \nAnd I LOVE Mon Guerlain. Just as I loved LPRN Intense and Shalimar Parfum Initial.  \nMG is definitely more grown up and I totally get a burnt vanilla that reminds me a lot of Shalimar. It is nothing like Shalimar, but the vanilla ingredient is easily the same. \nAnd let me tell you, it is nothing like LVEB from Lancome, or anything I smelled before. It is its own beautiful kind of vanilla. Just as Guerlain intended it.", "2": "Oohhhkay, I\u2019m thoroughly confused.

Nothing more, nothing less. \nI get a little (*very* little) pipe tobacco in the dry down and that is as sweet as it gets.  \nIt\u2019s not gourmand. At all. If this is gourmand, then I obviously no longer know what that word means.", "3": "Wore this out for the first time today, and I am so enamored by it! Will have to wear it for a few more days to really get to know it, but so far, here are my thoughts: \nLongevity is okay, nothing impressive. I get about 4-5 hours of wear. In the first 2 hours, it projects a whole lot (and I love that!), and it gets softer in the 3rd hour. \nBut the weird (good weird!) thing about it is, in those last 3 hours of wear, the scent surrounds you like a halo of sweet creamy vanilla-lavender. I feel like there's this aura of lavender and vanilla just glowing off of my skin. I don't have any other perfume that behaves like this. \nI love the scent of lavender in everything, which is probably why I'm so SMITTEN with this scent. I imagine, if you're not a big fan of that note, this might feel a little too... herbal for you, most especially in the beginning. I do also get a very, very, very faint smokey note in the later stages. \nI'm loving this so far. It's such a perfect balance of sweet and calming, and modern and comforting, and feminine with a hint of smoke & herbs. I just wish it lasted longer on my skin! But - I have a hunch that this will become my signature scent! But we will see after a few more full wearings :)", "4": "It seems a lot of reviews are focusing on the advertising for this perfume. I don't care one bit who Guerlain employs for their adverts. In 5 years no one will even remember. I judge perfume solely on how it perfumes. \nThis *is* the vanilla I have been looking for.  \nI never thought I'd like lavender in my perfume. To me lavender smells of those little sachets my grandmother kept in her underwear drawer. I love my grandmother, but I don't want to smell like her underwear drawer! But vanilla and lavender together are a revelation. \nI got a little sample of this and have tested it over a few weeks. This is my vanilla. It's very linear and simple which will turn some off. But if you want a vanilla perfume that is absolutely wearable in summer, isn't foody or sweet or cloying here she is. The lavender lightens the whole affair into something that's a little spicy, a little dry, and incredibly wearable. I'm testing Spiritueuse Double Vanille at the same time and I prefer Mon Guerlain. I find it more potent, longer lasting, and less sticky. \nCertainly test it first, but I really enjoy this."}, "55": {"0": "I don't want to protrude but this perfume is going to be celebrated and loved by masses I dare to challenge Aventus by Creed. Elena brought me full bottle of this amazing perfume from the fare at Esxence Milano Italy that she got as a gift and sorry everybody I am keeping it for myself no giveaways with this. \nNow about compliments... I am wearing it for the first time and I applied it under chin, behind the neck and on both wrists... so 4 sprays... opening is so uplifting and optimistic instant mood booster. After a while I am not aware of the scent so much but it is there lingering. It does not bother me at all... then after almost 2 full hours I go out of car and see neighbor she is on the first floor balcony about good 20 feet / 10 meters distance she asks me \"Oh! You smell so good are you making something new?\" Well, she knows that we create fragrances for The Vagabond Prince and she smelled many versions of our fragrances even before they were released... I was stunned that she could feel Hacivat from that distance. I told her \"I wish! This is something new Elena brought from Milano\". That puts sillage/projection to \"monster\" definitely and also longevity is great I got good 8 hours out of it before I took shower but I believe this fragrance is going to follow you from morning to evening easily.  \nYes this is great pineapple fragrance and oakmoss, jasmine... it is really divine. I am wearing it full two days already and I am pretty confident this one is keeper.", "1": "Nobody is going to say it? Ok, I guess I will. The Nishane caps are way too heavy for their 50ml bottles. Boom.  \nOn a more serious note I\u2019ve been wearing this off and on for a week and wasn\u2019t sure I felt about it. Those fruits upfront are serious, and once the oak moss appears it means business.  \nBut out of the blue I\u2019ve received 2 compliments from strangers today - in the afternoon. Kind of blew my mind because I didn\u2019t feel it was working for me. Now I have to reevaluate my entire life. It\u2019s made me second-guess all my prior assumptions. Maybe the cap isn\u2019t too heavy? \nQuick edit, every time I\u2019m out in public someone asks me what I\u2019m wearing, where did I get it and that it smells great. Had someone follow me around a grocery store. Nothing else I\u2019ve worn gets this much attention and I wonder if it\u2019s because that opening is unique. I went into Ulta to pick something up and lady at the fragrance counter asked me about. Another, much older lady, asked me if I got there. I\u2019m not very approachable so it\u2019s all very weird.", "2": "First off Creed Aventus is way over hyped. I\u2019ll never forget how excited I was when it came out to order a decant and after spraying I was like... yeah it smells good, but I was left with wanting more, I wanted this.... perhaps they should listen to their customers and find the most liked batch and stick with it, maybe the ones I got were so so.. but then again I got a decant of the adored Z01 and still wasn\u2019t that impressed.. I have a bottle but would gladly sell it for this. Nishane is all about the sillage rather than smelling it on skin in one spot, for me, the magic is makes when the air hits it and comes to you and others is where it\u2019s at for me. \nThis mixes with my skin chemistry so well. \nI\u2019m just going to sum this review up with two words AVENTUS KILLER \nSmell - 10\nLongevity- 10\nProjection - 9\nQuality - 9\nCompliment Factor - 10\nMasterpiece- yes \nBlind buy worthy- yes", "3": "I thought I liked Aventus, then I bought this. Almost feels like what Aventus should've or could've been. Definitely more refined....but at the same time so much more of a beast. In longevity, projection, and compliment factor, this blows Aventus away. Sorry for those that don't like to hear It, but to me this is the new king, no question", "4": "Luxury niche version of Aventus. I confirm this is a much better scent with beast-mode performance.", "5": "Luxury niche version of Aventus. I confirm this is a much better scent with beast-mode performance.", "6": "My first purchase from the house of Nishane and, before I get bombarded with questions, no it wasn't because it \"supposedly\" smells like Creed's Aventus. I swear whenever this scent was announced that's all you heard about and it honestly turned me off to the house. That was such a huge mistake. I would bet money that reviewers smelled the top notes and were like, \"OMG! It's so much like Aventus! It's an Aventus clone!\" Whether they did it for views or other reasons, I think they missed the mark completely. I've owned this for a little while and tested quite a bit. Here is my take on Hacivat:\n\nThe Smell: The opening is very fruity but with an earthy quality backing it. This is very noticeable from the jump. Of course, as expected, the pineapple note will have those people's attention who love/hate Aventus. I have some news for you now - the fruitiness doesn't last NEARLY as long as Aventus. The fruitiness fades on my skin after about 2-3 hours and becomes very earthy/woody. This is Hacivat's identity. It's a woody chypre with some fruity nuances. The patchouli and oakmoss keep it woody and earthy throughout the rest of the fragrance. I like how the fragrance transitions from one aspect to the other and reveals its identity to the world.\nSmell: 9/10\n\nProjection: Absolute monster. It projects for hours upon hours. Hacivat is an extrait de parfum and I would not expect anything less than stellar performance. Depending upon your skin and body chemistry, you'll probably wind up showering before this one fades completely. I had to shower to get this one off. It sticks on clothes for a while as well. I thought Hacivat's projection would revolve around the fruitiness/earthiness. I was partially correct. It does revolve around the earthiness but it's the woods that really elevate the scent and make it project/last.\nProjection: 10/10\n\nPrice: $250 for a 50 mL ($5 per mL) and $355 for 100 mL ($3.50 per mL). This is a pricey little devil. It checks the box for performance, it smells good, and can be worn in any season. It ticks every box for me EXCEPT the price. \nPrice: 5/10\n\nVersatility: You can wear it anytime/anywhere. If I could make a recommendation, I would say to wear it for special occasions/dates. The reason is because of how much it costs. Granted all you need to use is 2 sprays and you're set, I still wouldn't use it every day or you'll run out and have to drop another 250/355 dollars for another bottle. Some may not care and happily do this. For the vast majority, I would say use it sparingly. \n\nFor those who compared this to Aventus, I'm shutting it down right now. This is NOT Aventus. Not even close. Hacivat is its OWN creation. It has very little similarities and the two fragrances do two different things. I own both Aventus and Hacivat. Don't give me that BS about \"batch quality\" and all of that other Aventus nonsense. I prefer Hacivat simply because I think it does the woody aspect better and that's just my personal preference. Even if you own Aventus, I think Hacivat is worth sampling/testing. I will reiterate that I think the two are different and do different things so please do not judge Hacivat before trying it first.", "7": "This is a wonderful perfume, which I smelled from Murat Katran and was absolutely charmed how light, sensual and inoffensive it was, but still very present.\n\nIt is fruity, fresh, citrusy, mossy, and I bet it has a black currant note, or some gives it in a combination with other ingredients. It is much better on men.", "8": "After reading the other reviews, I decided to help clarify the \"does it smell like/better than Aventus\" comparisons/debate for anyone wondering about trying it.  \n\nThat explanation in simplest form is the following:\n\nAventus - Axe Body Spray = Hacivat\n\nWhich fragrance you prefer likely depends on your age, gender, and situation.\n\nTo elaborate, Hacivat lacks the dirty darkness of Aventus; it is a clean, creamy, woody, pineapple.  This makes it more versatile and unisex, at the expense of it being quite as arresting as Aventus.\n\nThe reviewer who described it as \"Aventus's rich uncle\" really hits the mark.\n\nI don't go to clubs, I'm not trying to get noticed, so Hacivat fits the bill for me. It's a cleaner, more playful scent you can wear during the day or at work. That said, my wife commented on it, and when I picked up my son he asked, \"What smells very good?\"\n\nI'm also the type of person who would rather smell \"of a scent\" rather than \"designer masterpiece\". I usually go with a straightforward oud, patch, maybe a little ambroxan-but if I'm feeling fancy, Hacivat is an easy reach.  \n\nIt has a very natural feel and the performance is astonishing which helps make up for its enormous price tag.  One spray of this will get you through the day.\n\nIf what you like most about Aventus is the opening, or if you're over 25 (or eccentric and under 25) and want to try a modern take on the now firmly established success of the pineapple accord, give it a shot.", "9": "2ml decant and it was a full bottle send my guy.\n\nThis is very unique to me.. without being weird.\n\nBIG TIME positive feedback from the ladies (my mom).\n\nThe opening has an awesome bubble gum vibe and I can't stop huffing it.\n\nDoes not smell like Creed Aventus. Dont @ me.", "10": "It appears that pineapple notes are cursed to be compared to Aventus forevermore, perhaps it's time to start a little campaign to #freethepineapple ?\n\nThe two most prominent notes on initial spray are a zesty, slightly sour pineapple and a super-green oakmoss that is somehow reminiscent of fresh garden clippings. Compared to other fragrances featuring prominent fruit notes (aside from bergamot) this doesn't carry much sweetness with it, which is a refreshing and mature decision on the perfumers part. The woods aren't overbearingly 'woody' but add to the general profile of a masculine leaning scent. It feels quite clean and suave in the way that oakmoss fragrances often feel and is obviously best suited to the well-groomed man. As it dries down it does become a touch sweeter, but not much.\n\nI will not be purchasing a full bottle because it's simply not bold enough for the price and that is purely a personal choice. It is absolutely signature scent worthy, if this appeals to you then you will have found a relatively uncommon niche scent that most people will find appealing.", "11": "Ok so here\u2019s my take on Nishane Hacivat. I am a huge fan of Creed Aventus along with other inspired scents like Orion, SOPFH, Emperor, etc. so I had a good feeling about Hacivat. I ordered a 100ml bottle from FragranceBuy.ca for right around $200. Even though it retails for much higher I think $200 is still a bit on the high side, but considering I\u2019ve paid more than that for Aventus I figured it\u2019s still worth it especially if it has this crazy performance and projection that I\u2019ve heard so much about. Well I got my bottle in and tested it out, and while it does remind me of Aventus it is actually quite different as it has more of a green thing going on. Within a few minutes that Aventus-like opening goes away and you\u2019re left with something a little more unique. Unfortunately, while I like the fragrance a lot, I am extremely disappointed with its projection and performance. My bottle in no way shape or form would I consider to be \u201cbeastly\u201c. It\u2019s mildly strong for maybe an hour and then I have to put my hand close to my nose to smell anything that\u2019s left of it. \n\nAfter reading up on Hacivat I discovered that there have been a number of repackagings done to it, even though this scent is only like 3-4 years old. I\u2019m very annoyed that I spent so much money on a niche scent that doesn\u2019t perform very well, especially since all I heard online is how insanely strong it is and how you have to be careful with how many sprays you do cause you\u2019ll choke out a room. I put on like ten sprays over the course of a couple hours and when my wife got home she didn\u2019t say a word, and believe me she would have said something if it was strong. \n\nAll in all, this is a great smelling scent, but for the money you might better spend a little more and hunt for an older bottle on eBay because these new batches are incredibly weak. Apparently Nishane really did try copying Creed Aventus, not only with scent but also with newer bottles being incredibly watered down.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nUpdate (same day): Ok I sent Nishane a question regarding the possibility of reformulation of Hacivat. I got a response within an hour and here is what they say about it:\n\n\u201cFirst of all, neither Hacivat nor any other Nishane perfumes have never been reformulated. Besides, we have no intentions to reformulate any of our scents. Especially Hacivat, such a loved and iconic scent! A brand should be crazy to reformulate it.\n\nThe power of the perfume: \nAll the batches here are strictly controlled by the trained noses using advanced technology and we are always happy to see that there is not any difference from batch to batch. Time to time, because of the humidity, altidute, season etc. The opening notes of the perfume can be sensed slightly different but the sillage and longevity of our perfumes are two important characteristics of them that we are always proud of. Because Hacivat is a fresh perfume (most of the formula \u0131s based on citrus notes), one must never expect a monstrous sillage from it. However, every week we try it and we get a great performance for a minimum of 10-12 hours. \n\nList of Ingredients:\nWe still have the same formula from the very first batch on. Why did the list of ingredients (which shows the allergens) on the back of the box change then? Because, at the beginning we were writing all the allergens on the list even though they were of negligible percentages inside the formula. But for the last 7 months, despite the same allergens are still in the formula, we decided not to state them on our boxes because the percentages of them are so small and according to the regulations the brand may prefer not to state them at all. People mistakenly concludes that \u201cbecause the ingredients list is less, Nishane should have reformulated the juice\u201d. No, it is not true.\n\nWe hope that our answers are satisfactory for you.\u201d\n\nIt was great to receive such a prompt and thorough response from the people at Nishane. Perhaps my skin just doesn\u2019t respond well to this scent in regards to overall strength of the scent? Perhaps the scent itself needs time to age before exhibiting any real intensity? For example, when I received a new bottle of Creed Viking it was extremely weak for quite some time. Over the course of several months it began intensifying drastically and it is now very powerful. I suppose I will take the company\u2019s word with my concern of possible reformulation and give the scent some time to macerate. Again, the scent is fantastic and I look forward to wearing the scent going forward, I just really hope it gets stronger.", "12": "Yes, it is similar to Aventus but with (significantly) better performance without any worries around batch issues and the like.\n\nSave your $$$ and buy this instead.", "13": "I love it more than Aventus. Performance is beast mode for a fresh fragrance.This is a perfume of its own.Every fragrance lover should try this.", "14": "Man.... I heard about this fragrance (and brand) in an article and I became so curious that I went and bought a sample online. By the time the sample had came the hype and curiosity that I had had lessoned. I had the sample for about a week before I actually tried it. One night I was bored and decided to try it at about 8pm (a few hours before bed). It smelled beautiful. It reminded me of Aventus, but only because any pineapple scent will remind you of Aventus! But this was beautiful, I can't explain it. It was just a beautiful, luxurious smelling fragrance with a clean, non-synthetic, non cloying, sweet natural pineapple note beautifully blended with other notes that I wasn't trained to smell yet. Like something I'd want to wear year around. Anyway, once I got over how good it smelled I got into bed. I woke up at 7am, smelled my arm and DAMN! it was still there, pineapples and DEFINITELY oakmoss, strong as ever, as if I had just put it on less than three hours ago.\n\nLong story short, this is one to definitely have in your collection if you like fruity scents with longevity. I cant comment about to the sillage or compliments because I didn't go anywhere, but I can tell you that it lasts and lasts! But as soon as I have $240 to spend freely, this is what I'll be using it on. \n\nFor the Aventus fans out there, don't worry! This is not an Aventus clone. Aventus is not the only fragrance allowed to have pineapple as it's main note. Hacivat is it's own niche fragrance and goes in its own direction.\n\nLongevity 10/10\nScent 10/10\n\nUPDATE June 1st, 2018; I just purchased a full bottle from Luckyscent.com.

Every single fragrance that comes out in todays society is \u201ccopying Aventus\u201d. This is leaps and bounds ahead of Aventus in my opinion. It starts off super fresh and citrusy and then the oak moss in the dry down makes me want to bury my nose into my neck, or wherever I sprayed it. This is something I could wear every single day no matter the occasion. This is a top 5 for me. If you\u2019re a fan of fresh oak moss, then here it is.", "19": "THIS is what I want my man to smell like!!!  This is so sexy and I find it a little different than Aventus.

A+ certified winner!!!\n\nUpdate: tried this again, and I would definitely wear this!", "20": "This is perhaps one of the most overlooked Aventus clones on the market. It doesn't smell exactly like Aventus, but very similar, and in my opinion better.This one is a great mix of Aventus and Bleu De Chanel in my opinion. It opens like Aventus and the pineapple is nice neither overly sweet or dirty. After 30-45 mins I get oak moss and birch. There also is definitely patchouli and some subtle florals, probably Jasmine. Longevity on my skin is easily 12 hours and probably more had I not showered. Lasts on clothes for weeks.  I can't get enough of this stuff. There is really no need for Aventus when you own Hacivat unless you are just a diehard collector, but I found out long ago that any Aventus after about 2013 is not even worth bothering with. Hacivat basically just does everything Aventus does, but better. You don't have to worry about batches or performance issues whatsoever. This stuff is expensive, but DEFINITELY worth it, unlike current Aventus. A 50ml bottle of this stuff will last you years because it's very potent and you never have to reapply, just 2 sprays in the morning and you are good for the next 24 hours.", "21": "Notes: Bergamot, Pineapple, Grapefruit, Jasmine, Patchouli, Cedarwood, Clearwood, Oakmoss and Timberwood\n\nPerfumer: Jorge Lee\n\nAn absolutely fantastic fragrance. Perfomance is crazy for this one. Opening with a juicy and vibrant Pineapple note followed by Lime and Grapefruit. The fruits lasts for quite some time but as the fragrance settles woody notes become prominent and Oakmoss really works well with Pineapple. Hacivat is sophisticated, elegant and definitely blind buy worthy. This has the same DNA as Aventus but not the same at all.", "22": "There's a lot of catch and release on this one in the fragcomm and i blind bought it because of the hype and all. Luckily I'm loving this one. Projects like crazy maybe 1 spray only needed for summer and 2 sprays for fall and colder days. 50ml will last you years if you have 20+ bottles in your collection and 100ml will last you till you hand it down to your grand kids. Lol", "23": "I own Nishane Hacivat and Creed Aventus.\n\nLong story short: I like, wear and enjoy Hacivat more. I also get more compliments wearing Hacivat. Creed Aventus had a good run for me and for some people it still does, no doubt. I just can't wear Aventus while I own Hacivat. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate aventus, i'm just not enjoying it as much as i enjoy wearing Hacivat. Hacivat is more bright, stronger and has great performance overal, lots of naturals included. Unlike Aventus, Hacivat doesn't have a bazillion batch variations. A finished product has 1 batch, not one-thousand. \n\nNishane Hacivat stays bright, sexy and happy till it's end, gempacked with naturals.\n\nPeople claiming Nishane Hacivat smells synthetic, get your nose checked. This has way more naturals compared to Aventus, period. I don't get the hate towards Nishane hacivat, it's based on nothing. You can't claim aventus has more naturals when they have (how many?) different batches? Aventus is imo an unfinished product with it's army of batches. Hacivat has 1 batch, is one product and wins by miles from  Aventus in every single aspect (unless you like the birch, smokiness aventus has). \n\nOveral: 9/10 for Nishane Hacivat.", "24": "Another brilliant creation from Nishane!\n\nFirst, a preface...its seems that anything these days with a bergamote and pineapple opening is named as smelling like Aventus or labelled \"a clone of the King.\" \n\nThis is nothing like Aventus. On a more controversial note, I feel like Office for Men smells to be in the same vein as this, which incidentally also does NOT smell like Aventus.\n\nAventus is light and bright in the opening but dries down to a hint of smokiness sharpness but predominantly musky with a light fruitiness.\n\nWhere Office for Men and Nishane are moderately similar is in the opening. Where Office is an intense, acidic and  harsh punch of fruitiness, Nishane is much smoother,effervescent and very well blended. They both become quite light and woody as they dry-down, but this is where the Nishane dominates and shines. It has a much stronger backbone, offering a green earthiness that is almost minty, and a musky powderiness in combination with the bright woods and an uplifting floral touch from the jasmine in the background.\n\nMasterfully blended, with incredible performance and probably the one of the best in this modern chypre genre.\n\nEDIT 20/3/21 - I sprayed this again after it sat in my collection for a whole year, and noticed that it had gotten much stronger than what i remember. But, it was much more synthetic and cloying smelling now and I didn't enjoy it at all. Sold!", "25": "Excellent performance, very sexy. 10/10", "26": "I am a very simple man who never likes to over complicate things, I think this really helps when describing such a subjective topic. Here is my \"two pence worth\" which I hope answers some FAQ's:\n\nDoes it smell nice? - Yes, it smells amazing, you simply cannot go wrong with this DNA.\nDoes it smell like Aventus? - Yes & No, it most definitely has a similar DNA, but small differences make all the difference. If somebody says \"it smells nothing like Aventus\" take a glove and slap them with it, because they are talking rubbish.\nIs it better than Aventus? - Yes, in my humble opinion it is streets ahead of the current Creed formulations, but lets be honest, the 2010 Aventus changed niche perfumery forever.\nDoes it last long? - Yes, it is absolutely nuclear for a \"Woody / Citrus\", I have never witnessed anything like it. I have heard Xerjoff Nio has \"beast mode\" longevity, but Hacivat is outstanding.\nDoes it project? - Yes, the scent bubble is extremely large and my Wife complained that I \"over sprayed\" after just 2 applications on the back of my hand.\nIs it worth the money? - Yes, I managed to source this from seescents.com for \u00a3239.00 and it is worth every penny. This is not a plug, but Marcus who runs that business is so helpful.\n\nHopefully this helps prospective buyers :)", "27": "Tried this for two days and I can tell you that this smell is amazing.

I like the smell of Pineapple but, it has the same impact on Hacivat imo. I was really looking forward to a heavy oakmoss presence but my decant is dominated by the Pineapple.\n\nAnd for those wondering if this resembles Aventus imo there is a strong resemblance minus the smoke. Interestingly, my wife smelled it and immediately jacked my decant. She absolutely loves it.\n\n.", "29": "If you\u2019re looking for an Aventus clone here\u2026 stop. Those who bought this because they heard it smells like Aventus\u2026 stop.

This lasts longer, sillage is better and you\u2019re money is better spent than on an overpriced bottle of moderately performing juice.\n\nYes it has a few of the same top notes, but this doesn\u2019t smell anything like Aventus outside the pineapple, and the dry down is amazing. Mossy, and woody, and there are still fruity aspects long into the lifespan. Highly recommend", "30": "THIS IS NOT AN AVENTUS CLONE ! \nTo keep it short this is clearly inspired by Aventus but by no means wants to be it.   I\u2019ll let experts describe the notes but all i can say this is true niche level mass appealing Aventus like fresh fragrance.  This stuff is amazing to say the least.  I want to add that i personally get a tiny little bit of a hint of Elysium Parfum cologne on both the opening and dry down. I love the woodyness in here,   As far as overall performance, i have a 03/2020 batch i just got from fragrancex and this is definitely super loud and projects like crazy for the first like 3 hourd with only 2 sprays vs 5+ your average freshie.  Overall id say this lasts around 8-10h and for being a fresher  scent i think this is amazing, im happy with the performance of my bottle dont let that hold you back from buying this amazing fragrance.\n10/10 for me and easily in my top 5 !", "31": "1.

It reminds me a lot more of Panda 2017 (Zoologist), which is a wonderful fragrance, with that earthy vibe (oakmoss, I guess). Hacivat is a multi-faceted, fresh and enticing scent with great longevity, and very good projection in the first couple of hours at least. I get a wonderful tartness, contrasted by a slight fruity sweetness and pierced by green, earthy and watery accords (can't pick the single notes: florals, moss and patchouli are so well blended together). Watery like dripping water, a brook in the woods, a pond covered in greenery. Wood notes always remain in the background. Bright, elegant, refreshing, enticing.", "34": "Imagine yourself immersed in a luscious rainforest full of trees and vegetation, it has just stopped raining, and for some unknown and mysterious reason the natives have just sprayed a million gallons of pineapple juice into the air... that\u2019s Hacivat!\n\nA green sparkly and effervescent Oakmoss/Cedar/Pineapple opening, enveloped in an amazing Patchouli aura, and with a very manly and soft woody bottom\u2026 simply delicious!!\n\nWe also have to address a few elephants in the room\u2026\n\n1.- Does it smell similar to Orion, Explorer, Aventus, and even Sauvage?\u2026 yes it does\u2026 but way better!!!\n\n2.- Does it smell moldy, wet, damp?\u2026 also yes\u2026 but in a green, woody, purposeful, and very interesting sort of way!!\n\n3.- Does it have ambroxan?\u2026 Nishane says it doesn\u2019t\u2026 I truly believe it does.\n\n4.- Is it kind of linear?\u2026 sadly it is\u2026 but who cares with a scent as magnificent as this!\n\nThis perfume is a performance beast\u2026 longevity is 12+ hours, and projection is moderate throughout the journey.\n\nIt leans completely masculine, and can be worn day or night in hot or mild weather\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t particularly recommend it for cold days\u2026 for me it seems a bit sharp and citrusy for cold days.\n\nOne of my favorite perfumes!!! Love it!!", "35": "Love. Love. Love. The cedar and pineapple combo puts me in a different headspace I've never experienced before. Hacivat is my entryway into niche perfumes, so it's all fresh and foreign. I can't stop sniffing my wrist. My nose is so excited. Finally. Something fresh and new, not another umpteenth derivative of a mass-produced formula.  No, this smells like nature. No vanillin. No ambroxan. No cloying jasmines (which I love, but it's been done a hundred times before). It's piercing, but in a refreshing way, like snorting fresh pine cones. That sounds painful and it is, but it's exciting too. Just the jolt my olfactory senses needed. I am smitten. I need more. Who am I kidding? I need them all!", "36": "Aventus Killer?\nI read many reviews with this title and that was an important reason for me to test it since I love Aventus.\nFirst time on paper stripe I found the opening very similar to Aventus but it went on a total different direction with time. On my skin however there is barley any similarities except of the pineapple note. Not even in the opening. Hacivat is sweeter and more feminine than Aventus, I think it is completely unisex. I find Hacivat a better composed more complex and more refined scent with higher overall quality than Aventus. Aventus feels a bit too simple and kind of hollow as a composition compared to Hacivat. The fragrance itself differs so much from Aventus that it makes no sense to consider it as a clone or killer or anything else of it. It is beautyfull on its own. I love it just as I do Aventus for different reasons.", "37": "To address the question 90% of people are in the comments to answer. No this is not Aventus. It's it's own beast and that's a great thing. The opening is somewhat similar in that it's fresh w nice pineapple and fruit notes but BIGGER. That's where it ends. The opening is a little more lemon heavy and with the prominent cedar can be little lemon pledgy depending on your skin. I find if I'm fresh out of the shower this is the case. Then it dries down deep, smoky, woody and smooth. The cedar tends toward astringent but very pleasantly so as it balances out the sandalwood and smooth patchouli. All this is underscored by a slight musty darkness from the oakmoss. If I was to describe the smell w something you might find familiar it's a cedar chest full of clothes worn by someone w a taste for vivid mid Eastern perfume that's stored in a slightly dank wood paneled basement. And it kills in performance and sillage. A spray behind both ears and one on your naked chest and you'll smell amazing all day. It will just develop and deepen all day into a night scent. \n\nTL:DR This is not Aventus. It is it's own bad ass scent with killer performance. I still love Aventus but I love this more.", "38": "Hacivat isn't the Aventus clone at all for my taste. This is fruitier creamier no smoky and give a little bit floral vibe. That's gorgeous charming citrus type. Very loud and great performance 8+ hours on my dry skin. Sillage is gorgious also just put on 1 spray and I walked away around 2-3 meters I got the smell. So I choose this before Aventus for everyday use.\n\nScent :  5/5\nLongevity : 5/5\nSillage :  5/5\nNice and perfect for summer fresh creamy fruity scents. Must have.", "39": "Extremely pleasing and versatile fragrance.\n\nCopy of Aventus? I want to know if the people saying that it's a copy have ever smelled at least one of these parfumes!\n\nI also think that Hacivat is better.", "40": "This is a way more sophisticated version of aventus and they only share the same opening. Once the drydown kicks in they go different directions. Basically this is the King of pineapple whole aventus is the prince.", "41": "Smells fantastic, calming and versatile. Very uplifting. This has a bright creamy accord that is simply beautiful. I love it after the king of pineapple vibe Creed Aventus. I want to smell like this as a man.", "42": "In one word- AMAZING.\nDefinitely 10/10 in almost every possible way.\nThe only downside is the price but that is subjective,\nFor me its definitely worth it.", "43": "It smells like an expensive posh men's fragrance. Fresh with a touch of pineapple and grapefruit at the start. It changes again as the citrus notes wain and it gets much heavier. Its sweeter and quite patch strong. The oak moss also becomes much more evident. The pineapple stays all along it's timeline.\nId like it on my fella to wear in cool and cold weather. It has good longevity and sillage.", "44": "I usually refrain from common phrases and annecdotes because it\u2019s often used to inappropriately describe a scent but.... yep it\u2019s an Aventus Clone to a tee - well almost. Aventus dries down to a cedar and simple woods where as to my liking Hacivat replaces the sawn woods with a darker creamy smooth patchouli sandalwood. \n\nIt\u2019s better. I sprayed 3 times more quantity of Aventus (recent batch) on my right arm as opposed to Hacivat on the left.\n\nHacivat is obviously more powerful. The initial pineapple is also more natural and stronger the long drydown revealing the smooth woody base.\n\nAventus Pineapple feels like it has less depth and infact more synthetic. The woody dry down a little stronger with nutmeg being more prominent.\n\nI will replace my Aventus next time with Hacivat quite gladly.", "45": "Beautiful Pineapple, lime ,Woody and oakmoss ,Yes this is great pineapple fragrance and oakmoss, definitely stands on its own ,I find it a little different than aventus especially in the dry down \nThe Perform is great to excellent \nIf you like pineapple scent you should buy it\nFollow me on Instagram @Ferromatos", "46": "It is AMAZING. The signature Oakmoss of Nishane makes this stand out from the other Aventus like scents.

Yes i own Aventus. No it's not my #1 favorite (it's my 2nd favorite).\n\nHaving said that, i highly expected a mind-blowing jaw-dropping opening; i didn't get that, BUT it was a nice opening. Fruity sweet with a weird almost juniper-like feel to it.  I will admit i honestly do dismiss perfumes sometimes if they don't instantly WOW me, but i liked it and went on about my business.\n\nMaybe 20 or 30 minutes later, the wafting aroma was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.  It was lightly sweet, naturally fruity and a bit musky which really brought it all together. NOTHING like Aventus at all, not even worth another mention. What i thought smelled like juniper, starts to smell oakmoss-y at this point.\n\nI'm really interested in this house having tried this, and my friend also sent me Bluebijou but I'm going to continue enjoying this one for now.  Easy 9 out of 10, this is exactly the sort of scent that i like.\n\nOh, one more thing, the sillage of this smells remarkably different than if you smell your wrist.  On the wrist it's enjoyably kind of sour but in the air it's light, crisp and sweet.  When you smell it in the air whether on yourself or someone else, it really makes you take notice.", "48": "from opening to drydown, it\u2019s love at the first sight.", "49": "People think anything that has pineapples smells like Aventus smh\n\nThis stuff smells Amazing \nA lot of people won't relate to this but it reminds me of eating pineapple kunafa at the Grand Bazar\n\nYou can wear this year round but I really hope Nishane makes a winter specific dessert version of Hacivat"}, "56": {"0": "This fragrance has perfectly captured what everyone has been trying to do for the last 10 or so years. \nIt's La Vie est Belle but earthier and classier.\nIt's Elie Saab times a million.\nIt's Jimmy Choo without the sickly.\nIt's Black Orchid without the headache. \nI first smelt this on a colleague on a train and by the end of the journey I knew I had to have this fragrance. I couldn't wait to smell it again. It makes me happy in a way I can't use words to explain. I think it will be my signature for a long time. The projection and longevity are perfect. When people smell it I can see their eyes light up. \nI understand the negativity about this being a re-imagining of a classic. However, the girl in the store told me an emotional story. Three weeks before he sadly passed Givenchy himself was brought the fragrance. He was so enamoured with it and believed that the new scent perfectly represented the spirit of the fragrance that he has lent his personal signature to the inside of the box as a seal of approval. The last fragrance signed off by Givenchy himself, how special.", "1": "Oh wow , I can\u2019t believe the dislikes here. Slowly I know when there are a lot of dislikes here that I more than likley LOOOVE it ! This fragrance is excellent ! It\u2019s super long lasting , top notch quality and quite differnt , classy yet gourmand all at once. Ok you sort have have to like tuberose to like this one as it is definitely a tuberose centred perfume. Yes it is sweet but in a fresh ,refreshing way. Love the addition of cherries and ambroxan , such a creamy lovely fragrance. Longevity is through the roof here. Days on my clothes and bedsheets. Very impressive. It\u2019s a classic ,modernized tuberose fragrance, done to perfection. Nothing but compliments, projects very well and is heavy creamy and classy. Bottle is also heavy and substantial, this is a winner !!!\nAgreed with review below me , Antonpan, finnaly something outstanding from Givenchy! Their perfumes are often good , almost all are very nice ,but this is excellent !", "2": "This is a 10/10, I always receive compliments when I wear this. I don\u2019t get grape or artificial grape at all. On me, it reminds me of incense with pear, honey and a bit of cherry actually\u2026\nAlso, it performs like a beast. It\u2019s simply amazing and I\u2019m gonna buy a bottle of this and the intense version as soon as I empty some bottles \ud83d\ude0d   \nI was a bit surprised by all the negative reviews here, but then again, this usually is the case for fragrances here that aren\u2019t niche, discontinued or from the 1700\u2019s\u2026or if you\u2019re simply not a fan of tuberose", "3": "My kindergarten age son picked this for me for Mother\u2019s Day. His father asked him if he would like to buy something for me while they were at the mall to watch the new Pok\u00e9mon movie. My son said a perfume because I love perfume. He knows me well!  \nHis father said my son smelled about 10 fragrances and narrowed it down to three he smelled very carefully before choosing this one. When he arrived home he burst through the front door and gave me my gift. I was so touched and he made me open it in front him while he exclaimed what a nice bottle it had. I asked him why he picked this one and he said because it smelled like cherries, bananas, grape, pineapple and vanilla. I think he\u2019s interpreting the tuberose as banana/grape and the vetiver as a sharp pineapple.  \nI think it smells like Amarige and Live Irresistible EDT had a love child and that love child grew up and wears Guerlain Vetiver Pour Elle, lol. It\u2019s undeniably a Givenchy creation and smells of 80\u2019s vintage in a powerhouse perfume and big hair kind of way. The longevity and sillage is outstanding. I sprayed this on my hand at 5pm and 8 hours later it\u2019s as strong as it was upon first spray. To me it\u2019s mostly cherry and vetiver. I personally think the vetiver gives it a little bit of a masculine undertone because I always find vetiver masculine. Everyone saying it\u2019s \u201cgirly\u201d must not have been patient after the initial 15 minutes of sweet cherry powder or they haven\u2019t smelled it all and wrote an angry review because they were told it doesn\u2019t smell like the original. The vetiver becomes prominent to me and is very sharp and earthy. One more touch of it and I\u2019d not been able to wear this as I dislike vetiver very much. Thankfully the fruit notes and white florals keep it at bay enough for me to handle it. I think this would smells as nice on a man in the way many floral sweetish fragrances with vetiver and bergamot do. \nI disagree this is a scent you wear when you don\u2019t want to stand out. I literally laughed out loud when I read someone wrote this. It\u2019s very, very strong and you certainly will stand out and it won\u2019t be in a good way if you overspray. Also, the perfume is NOT pink as someone wrote. Mine at least, is a pale golden color which matches the fragrance well.  \nTo sum it up, it\u2019s vintage but 80\u2019s not 50\u2019s, powdery sweet, tart cherry and bergamot with a loud grapey tuberose and a very sharp, earthy vetiver and patchouli smelling of ripped up wet grass with roots intact. It\u2019s not girly and it\u2019s not near the sweetest fragrance I\u2019ve ever smelled. I\u2019d say not even top 50 sweetest to me. I think if you enjoyed the big tacky 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s perfumes like Amarige, Poison or any of the countless fumes of the time which embraced the loud, grapey tuberose, you will like this. I use \u201cbig tacky\u201d as a term of endearment. I loved the big tacky 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s of my infancy and early childhood.", "4": "Finally, something really outstanding from Givenchy.\nYeah, L'Interdit is fruity and sweet, but still I smell a tuberose here, and that tuberose is extremely beautiful. A neo-tuberose.\nSyrupy pears at the beginning or even strawberries, a cloying tipycal for nowadays sweetness in the development and an earthy, green, menthol-y tuberose in the dry down. \nA scent for everyone. I like it much better than another neo-tuberose, Hermes Twilly. Highly recommend!", "5": "I'm baffled how some people are almost offended by this perfume. I get it, same name different smell, I get that part. But isn't that an interesting approach to show younger generations (who don't really seem to enjoy old school perfumes) something that has been on the market for years and just now got a completely different scent and look to it? To be honest, I couldn't care less about these old scents, I know some people feel sentimental about  them, and some of them really are quite lovely, but it's clear that a vast majority of younger generations don't seem to care about them. \nNow I've read reviews before I could try it on and I was so confused why people smell LVEB with this one? I can not in ANY way sense any resemblance to LVEB whatsoever. I'm no professional, not trying to seem like one don't get me wrong, but this reminds me more of Burberry London than LVEB. I know everyone perceives scents differently, but because of the white floral notes this one rings London for me.\nJudging from the reviews I was expecting a more in-your-face kind of a scent, but this is a beautiful, chic, glamorous scent I imagine wearing on a lovely spring day in Paris. I instantly fell in love with it! I do agree that the advertisement how the fragrance is supposed to be \"thrilling\" is practically a joke, since this perfume is very subtle. The smell is beautiful, but definitely not thrilling. The first thing I smell is tuberose and pear with just a little bit of caramel which makes the scent very girly and playful. The dry down shows a more mature and classy part of the fragrance with which makes it wearable for anyone.\nI enjoy it and definitely consider it one of my top 5 favorites!", "6": "In the town where I went to school, there was a girl who was very pretty and very happy. She talked a lot, in a peculiar high-pitched voice. Others sometimes made fun of that voice, but she either did not notice or chose not to react. She was never not enthusiasic. \nWe, on the other hand, were (in our own eyes) more edgy, critical, grungy, mysterious. I always liked that girl, but felt superior to her. \n\nYears later I met her in Vienna. I had already started to work, was stressed and obsessing about my career, while she was still studying for a degree you can hardly find a job with. She was as joyful as she had ever been. At that moment I realised how genius she really is. \n\nThis woman is L'Interdit to me: loud, pretty, brilliant, happy, invincible. \nWe as grumpy teenagers, who thought they were cool, are the depressing advertising campaign for this wonderful perfume.", "7": "L'Interdit (2018) too me is one of the most interesting releases this year. It\u2019s strong and heady, sweet, but bitter and dark at the same time. So no, it\u2019s not yet another girly pink fragrance. Composition is complex and really interesting due to rare combination of ripe cherry and tuberose. At first it is dominated by cherry \u2013 the fruit is ripe, it has a bitter undertone, I could almost feel the sweet and sour taste of the fruit in my mouth. Then heady tuberose and jasmine comes in, combined with vanilla, buttery caramel and clean white patchouli.  L'Interdit is sweet, but nothing like sugary Black Opium or La Vie Est Belle. Few days ago I tested Lost Cherry by Tom Ford \u2013 another sweet spicy cherry scent. Must say, L'Interdit (2018) is far much more innovative and \u201cniche\u201d (although its not niche). Lasting power and silage are amazing. It\u2019s not my style, but nonetheless an impressive, serious, yet playful scent.", "8": "I tested this a few weeks ago and immediately bought a full bottle. \n\nVery sophisticated, elegant and intriguing scent with a powdery vintage vibe, yet so pleasantly youthful and modern at the same time. The floral, sweet and fruity notes are beautiful in this one.\n\nThis is what I was expecting my favourite perfume house Guerlain's Mon Guerlain to be, since this is similar to it, but somewhat more complex, pleasantly sweet and flowery (and don't get me wrong: I like MG too).\n\nI have to admit that I have never tried the original, but I think that just works for my benefit, since there is no need for a comparison for me between the two. Even though now I'm curious to try the original as well. \n\nSo Givenchy did a good job here in my opinion, creating a new intriguingly sophisticated scent and at the same time evoking my interest to try their older scents.", "9": "10 out of freakin' 10!! This is the best perfume I have smelled in my entire life!! \n\nI smelled this on a girl I worked with and I was so in love with it that I asked her what it was and bought it immediately. \n\nI've seen lots of reviews saying it's nothing new, nothing special, but I have never smelled anything so intoxicating and beautiful. I'd like to know of all the perfumes that apparently smell \"all pretty much the same\" to this, because I'd buy them all haha!\nI've received so many compliments when I wear it, from my boyfriend to my parents, to a stranger on the bus. \n\nI never smelled the original version (or any of the recreations in between that and this) and I only learned its history when I researched this version, so I'm not comparing it to anything - I just appreciate it for what it is. \n\nIt lasts FOREVER on me. I put it on at 6pm and could still smell it faintly when I woke up the next morning at 7am. It washed off in the shower but I swear I still got a small whiff of it from what was left in my hair later that day.\n\nDefinitely one of my favourite perfumes of all time!\n\nEDIT: Since writing this, I've noticed that every time I've just sprayed this on, my boyfriend says \"Wow, you smell so good! You smell like grapes!\" Hahaha! Love it! I love grapes and grape juice and since he said that, I always smell it in the top notes now.", "10": "I can see how lovers of the original are upset at this one. I agree, Givenchy should came up with a new name altogether for this one as there's no note similarities between this and the old L'Interdit. \n\nWith that out of the way, lovers of the fruitchuli trend can rejoice once again. I get mostly caramel tuberose on my skin with patchouli lurking in the background, giving it some depth and balancing out the sweetness. True, it's not a groundbreaking fragrance, but it's nice. On my skin, it's very reminiscent of Lancome's LVEB; I just get loads more caramel with this one. I think it's a very easy to wear scent; good for fall, winter and perhaps cool spring days. I will say, now I'm curious to try the old L'Interdit just out of curiosity's sake. \n\nThis one probably isn't going to be for lovers of the classic fragrances, but if you're into the fruitchuli trend and like sweeter scents, then do try it. Overall, I'm way more pleased with this one vs Dior's Joy.", "11": "Stunning, darling! Just stunning.\n\nOne of my all-time favourite fragrances is Insolence by Guerlain, and I think this one is so very close to that scent. When you first spray it it almost has an old lady medicinal kind of sharpness to it, but give it a few minutes and its beauty is quietly revealed. It\u2019s such a mysterious floral, followed by a touch of sweetness and ending in a woodsy floral, it\u2019s a truly gorgeous blend. I could wear this all day every day for the rest of my life and be more than happy.\n\nIt lasts all day too, which it should for the price as it\u2019s almost $200 for a bottle in Australia, holy moly that\u2019s a lot of money but let me tell you, it\u2019s worth it to smell this good.\n\n11/10. A new favourite.", "12": "I really can't understand so much hate for this beautiful version of a classic.\nI agree that they shouldn't have named it after Audrey's favorite perfume due to...as we can see comparisons. However the first thing that dragged me to sample it (besides the beautiful bottle), was the name.\nNow regarding the juice itself I must say that I simply loved it. It's bright but also sweet chic and modern. \nI get the dark grapes at the top and a couple of minutes later the beautiful neroli with some jasmine and a very subtle tuberose. \nBase notes join the flowers and irradiate charm and innocence.\nTimes change, L'Interdit changed too.\nThis is a new classic for a new generation that I am very pleased to recommend. It's beautiful!", "13": "I'm so happy with Givenchy for giving us this jewel! I've been really waiting for a perfume from them that will combine classic femininity with freshness and sweetness. Very Irresistible was too...pink...then it was too purple haha! the bottles looked like they belonged in a little girl's playroom. The EDT was too rosy, the EDP was too sexy, Dahlia Divin was too sweet. The only other one I can name off the top of my head is Organza, which my mother wore 20 years ago. \nL'Interdit makes me feel like I am standing in the middle of a dewy jasmine garden. It's classically floral...it has the romance of jasmine, of tuberose, but those notes are modernly fresh here, not heady (heady is beautiful in its own way). The jasmine here is jasmine sambac, the softer variety, not the soapy-screechy-clean jasmine grandiflorum. The tuberose dominates with its buttery tones. With that said, this is in no way like the white-floral butteriness of something like Frederic Malle's Carnal Flower or Robert Piguet's Fracas. L'Interdit is first and foremost, dewy, almost aquatic, as if you step into this jasmine garden with the first morning rain. The bottle is clean and simple, minimalistic, yet weighty enough to feel like you've got something substantial in your hands. I've found my \"the one!\"", "14": "This is actually a very interesting and nice scent, I like it!\nIt's got a special scent to it, it could be a signature scent.\nIt's sweet, but not sickly, it's very well composed. Something smells edible in it, like vanilla and caramel dessert, but not in a sickly sweet way. \nI can't believe how well tuberose note suits into this scent. I sense cherries, vanilla and other white floral notes as well.\nI think I must add it to the want list.", "15": "This is goodness in a bottle. As much as I wanted to hate it- I just can't. White flowers that smell divine (and I usually dislike white florals), a mouthwatering gourmand accord and just the right amount of patchouli. Simply gorgeous, sweet white flowers on a creamy , intoxicating and sensual base. Longevity and sillage are top-notch, too. I need a full bottle of this \"prohibited\" fragrance a.s.a.p", "16": "This one is truly impressive. It\u2019s been a long time since a designer perfume made me enamoured like this one. I smelled it in Shoppers and , based on the top notes, I had to have it . The top notes are the best of this perfume, but the middle and the base aren\u2019t bad either . \nOverall this is a dark, sensual and risqu\u00e9 Tuberose . I can tell it\u2019s the same Tuberose that Ropion put in the stunning Carnal Flower. He could not however allow a Givenchy to stay as pure and elegant as a Malle. So, some dark and sweet accords were added , and the result is quite beautiful . Not the sheer luminosity, perfection and elegance Malle has, but a more mundane  yet sexy beauty. I don\u2019t specifically sense the Patchouli, and I am glad, i am extremely picky with Patchouli. The vetiver is herbal and adds some woodbines behind the white flowers. The vanilla brings some sweetness as well as a liquor like smoothness . \nThe bottle is simple , but very classy . \nLasting power ans silage are both good. \nThe price ? $131 plus Tax for the 80 ml bottle . Worth every penny if you ask me ! \nHighly recommended but not a safe blind buy . \nI am not familiar with the vintage original L\u2019interdit , I cannot comment as to how they would compare but this is a stunner ! One of the best offerings I\u2019ve seen in the past few years . \nEdit : I wore it today. A man complimented  me and I thought he was just flirting but he actually came with a pen and a notebook after me and asked me to write down the name of my perfume to buy it for his lady !", "17": "This is not my cup of tea (I don't care for floral-fruity scents, or gourmands for that matter), but among the gazillions of similar sugary waters that hit the market each year, this is one of the more interesting fragrances. Yes, it is way too sweet for my liking, and yes I don't care for artificial fruity notes, but at least this fragrance has a certain character that is sorely missing in most present-day offerings. The combination of red fruits and tuberose is rather interesting and wearable. Kudos to Dominique Ropion who seems unable to mess up, even when presented with the blandest of briefs.", "18": "Givenchy L\u2019Interdit opens with a strong, sweet cherry rendered more sparkling and pulpy by juicy pear. Not too medicinal so as to evoke cough syrup, nor too tart or dark, but a cheerful, radiant and girly. \n\nThen the tuberose emerges from the heart with its chalky texture. As expected from a fragrance aimed at the mass market, the tuberose here is forbidden to show any camphor-green, mushroom or animalic nuances. It\u2019s polished, clean, well-mannered, so as to not cross any line. While it\u2019s not my favourite interpretation of this flower, as a modern tuberose of recent years, I like this new version of L\u2019Interdit better than Herm\u00e8s Twilly, thanks to the subtle vegetal, almost celery-like accent and a transparency in texture brought out by ambroxan in L\u2019Interdit, instead of the artificial sandalwood in rendering it muddy and weighing it down in Twilly.\n\nThe dry down of L\u2019Interdit comes back to the more familiar territory of fruitchouli, where the clean yet medicinal patchouli darkens the initially fresh cherry and turns it into cherry jam along with caramel and vanilla. The sillage is heavy, while it can last more than 12 hours on my skin.\n\nIt\u2019s probably no surprise to anyone that this 2018 version of Givenchy L\u2019Interdit smells nothing like the original one. The fragrance also doesn\u2019t sit well with the new spin on the \u201cforbidden\u201d theme as it\u2019s firmly within current clean tuberose and sweet fruitchouli trend. However, I still quite like the middle phase with that unexpected vegetal twist on clean tuberose, albeit in a pretty discreet way. I think it might worth considering for those who are looking for a slightly more grown-up, less gourmand fruitchouli fragrance.", "19": "This is absolutely stunning! Very little to complain about when it comes to this. It feels very powdery and like the new idea of elegance. \n\nPear, but not annoying... like Black Opium's pear soaked flanker. I liked this far more than I expected. More ideas to come soon, I think. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes tuberose in the bubblegum aspect.", "20": "Class in a bottle. I have also the le rouge version and love all the L\u2019interdit line. This is a very classy and sophisticated bubblegummy tuberose, very addictive, can\u2019t stop smelling my wrist wearing this. Signature scent worthy.", "21": "I really love it. It smells sweet yet classy, bubbly yet elegant. To me, it\u2019s like a sugary water-soaked flower bouquet. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve known something like this scent before. It\u2019s definitely modern, a bit unusual. The sillage is great. Overall quality a+. I can\u2019t wait to get it.", "22": "So classy smelling. This is the fragrance house that knows how to showcase tuberose for the pungent scent haters like myself. So elegant, still, do not overspray this!!", "23": "I am absolutely in love with this fragrance! I\u2019m going to attempt a review (I find fragrances fairly hard to describe but I\u2019ll give it my best shot). Before I start - it\u2019s rare for me to find a fragrance that I can fall in love with and I\u2019m incredibly picky with what I wear. I went into my local department store to purchase a few makeup items and on my way out I could smell something incredible as I walked past the perfume department. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced and it was this fragrance. The bottle did nothing to catch my eye and I may not have even picked it up had someone not just sprayed it, the bottle isn\u2019t terrible by any means but it\u2019s certainly not eye catching! For reference I currently wear 3 fragrances on a regular basis - Gucci Bloom, Narciso for Her and MAC Turquatic. All vastly different from one another but I love them all eqaually. \n\nL\u2019Interdit is so beautiful and fresh yet it\u2019s also creamy, smooth and mouthwatering. I\u2019m not a huge fan of many of the fragrances that have come out in the last few years, they all smell somewhat similar with no real personality. This is so different! I\u2019ve read the other reviews and they seem to contradict everything that I feel about this perfume! It\u2019s unique, it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s simply perfect! I love every single note in this scent and they blend together perfectly to create something unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. Put it this way - I returned the makeup I had purchased just so I could take this perfume home with me. \n\nIt\u2019s long lasting yet not overpowering, I feel classy and beautiful while wearing this and like the world is my oyster. An absolute gem!", "24": "L'Interdit is sweet and has quite the personality. I could tell by the notes it was going to something I would like. I am so glad I purchased this too. \n\nFirst off I was not anticipating how sweet it was going to be. It has the same kind of sweetness as Elie Saab Le Parfum or Ralph Lauren Woman. I find it similar to both. I absolutely love the Tuberose, Orange Blossom and Jasmine in this. There is a bold richness to them that is very womanly and very stunning! \n\nAfter the shock of sweetness wore off I picked up the Pear note strongly. The Vanilla is gorgeous too at this point. I love fruity florals and this one has some teeth. Like Juicy took some steroids.\n\nThe Patch was significant toward the dry down. Along with the Vetiver there is a Powdery note to this on the dry down as well adding some complexity to the floral notes. I actually find the pyramid to this very interesting and well thought out. \n\nThe sillage is huge at first spritz then it abates to become heavy. The longevity is huge on my skin. This one should wear well in cooler weather. In warmer weather I would find this to be cloying though. Try it but let it develop. The dry down is worth the wait. 10/10+", "25": "Obtained a sample, and would absolutely purchase it. It\u2019s clean, beautiful, feminine, classy, and an easy signature fragrance. However, I already own and love Elie Saab Le Parfum and Ralph Lauren Woman. This is something of a mix of those fragrances. Maybe it will end up in my collection when those are gone.\nEdit (several months later): I haven\u2019t finished my Elie Saab or RL Woman, but it\u2019s my birthday and this was on my wish list. Ok, yeah yeah, I didn\u2019t need another bottle of perfume. While it is similar to others I have, it\u2019s not exactly the same. I\u2019ve realized that when I wear either ES or RLW, I am left wanting something more. Now that I have this, I know THIS is what I was wanting. I have no complaints about the perfume. I just wish Givenchy would have used Hepburn\u2019s granddaughter as the face. I think that would have been a beautiful way to honor the legacy and present it as modern. People get so upset that this isn\u2019t vintage, but I just wonder which of the versions would Audrey like best. No guarantees that it would have been the first one. Also, if we had the original available to us, how many of us would actually like it? I\u2019m guessing that if Givenchy thought it would sell, they\u2019d sell it.", "26": "Loved my little sample so much that I've ordered a full bottle. Initially I get the  inky fruity smell of a cherry gel pen I had as a child, then the scent grows more complex and its very beautiful. Strong and long lasting! Newfound love.", "27": "This is surprisingly beautiful. I had to come check the notes because I couldn\u2019t quite tell what the magic was. Immediately I got a juicy burst of (what I thought was) honeysuckle. Fruity, white floral, sweet, and something grounding the symphony. \n\nIt\u2019s lovely.", "28": "This scent somehow defines my image of autumn in Paris. It is non-sweet but cozy in a way, aromatic and fresh but warm at the same time, due to the woody (patchouli) base with a hint of vanilla and vetyver. Most has been said already so I'll just add a tiny bit of my enthusiasm caused by the presence of this scent on the market - no matter how near or far it is from the original. To my nose it is an obvious reminder of what I remember from decades ago - the classic. I definitely want it for autumn!", "29": "Dominique Roupion is one of the best perfumers of this century! He made some bad ass fragrances these last years and some of his creations are part of the perfume history forever! \nAlien\nLa vie est belle\nOlymp\u00e9a\nPure poison\nArmani code\nL'interdit\nGirl of now\nY YSL\nL'homme \nLa nuit de l'homme \n\nWhat a great nose!!\n\nNow back to l'interdit, very complex yet very simple sweet and white flower perfume, this perfume changes all the time and every minute i smell something different! Sometimes i get the sweetness of the pair and the vanilla and sometimes the white flowers hit me in the face  \nThe tuberose in here is not fresh but bubblegummy and sweet \n\nDefinitely worth the try \n\nI own both this and the intense version, they're very similar just 2 notes added: pepper and sesame \nYou don't need both \nI prefer the intense version though, much much sexier and the sesame note is booooooomb\n\nEdit: the drydown is way better than the opening it's delicious and warm \nI'm in love\nMy new fav\n\n2nd edit: i love l'interdit so much now  that i'm thinking of buying the edt too  to complete my collection since i have the edp and the intense", "30": "L'Interdit (2018) by Givenchy is bubblegum tuberose turned up to 11. Typically, we can find this type of tuberose in niche fragrances, but it is loud and clear in this designer offering.\n\nMy husband said that I smell like bubble gum with a little bit of mint. He seems to like it.\n\nI'm not getting bubblegum, but I am getting a juicy grape/cherry note that lasts for hours. Normally fruity notes bother me, but this is bright, happy, and almost good enough to eat. Sometimes this smells a little like Dr. Pepper with a pretty woody floral background. I don't really smell patchouli, but after a couple hours, a green musky note appears. \n\nI'm quickly make my way through a sample, and that is usually a sign that I enjoy a fragrance. \n\nExcellent performance...\n\n3.5/5", "31": "This perfume changed. My. Life. It\u2019s an amazing grape syrupy floral and it\u2019s so unique. That may not sound appealing but I don\u2019t like grape scents and I\u2019m not big on white florals but something about this is amazing. When I smell it I feel like I\u2019m teleported to one of my favorite English classic books either something by \u201cJane Austen\u201d or \u201cCharlotte Bront\u00eb\u201d. This is a beautiful fragrance and I can 100% see how it was designed for the beautiful Audrey Hepburn. It\u2019s a little too cloying for the warmer months but this shines beautiful in the Autumn/Winter.", "32": "I fell in love with L\u2019interdit when walking through Dillard\u2019s and the bottle caught my eye...I decided to spray it on me as I was leaving...I could not stop thinking about it...I found a great deal on a small 1/2ounce bottle which just came in and I love love love it...Hopefully when my husband gets home it doesn\u2019t trigger his allergies...If not, This might just become my new signature scent..on my skin it smells lovely, soft, a little sweet, a little floral, a little patchouli, very well balanced, I cannot stop smelling my wrist...I am addicted", "33": "If\u00a0I\u00a0had\u00a0to\u00a0abandon\u00a0for a while my beloved floral fruity scents, many of which are just a murmur, I would not hesitate to wear L'interdit.\nIn my little world this scent makes itself felt strong. Tuberose here is creamy and overwhelming. \nAnd I find it fabulous!!\nI\u00a0hope\u00a0the\u00a0estimators\u00a0of the\u00a0Original do not offend, I\u00a0didn't get to know\u00a0it. I know\u00a0for\u00a0sure\u00a0I lost one of the masterpieces in the history of all time perfumery.", "34": "L'interdit is fucking gorgeous. \n\nIt smells like an expensive grape candy. I don't care what anyone says this juice is beautiful. The biggest tragedy is how playdoughy it turns on my skin.", "35": "So I love tuberose. Holy crap do I love this!\nI will definitely be buying a full size of this.\n\nCreamy tuberose that blends so well with orange blossom. I originally discovered my love for tuberose with Amouage's Honour. If you like this you'll undoubtedly love Honour, which is a very expensive special occasion only perfume. This is like a beautiful, casual, everyday version of Honour. Less niche and complex, more mainstream and simple, but not at all in the way that most designer frags are!\n\nThe patchouli reminded me of the dry patchouli you get in Jimmy Choo's signature; bright, floral,fresh, and just ever so slightly 'exotic.'", "36": "Amazing EDP!!!...I find it accurate to describe it as a white flower composition wrapped in a slight fruity sweet veil. Its actually an interesting fragance that i find very feminine and elegant...loveee!!!", "37": "This is brilliant! Sweet and elegant. Tested this side by side with Miss Dior edp (2017) which I really like, mind you but, THIS?! this is gorgeous. I think this is a wonderful reiteration of the original because it has the sweetness common in this age of perfumery but there\u2019s a note that takes it back ever-so-slightly to the previous era. I think it\u2019s aldehydes but thankfully it\u2019s very much controlled here and just gives the scent its elegance. So it smells grown up but not bluntly vintage by any means. I can wear this and confidently gift it to my mom as well.\nTo say the least miss Dior edp, while lovely, smells generic compared to this. This is something special\nLove! Love! Love!\n\n\nEdit: On a second note, this can get very sweet so spray with caution; I   wouldn\u2019t go crazy on this, it becomes sickly", "38": "I simply fell in love with it at first smell and chose this unique combination of aromas as my signature perfume. It is sexy, remarkable, great, lovely, everlasting with a gorgeous sillage...You will definitely not passed unnoticed if you wear L' Interdit!!!", "39": "I was prepared not to like this. I thought it would be beige and uninteresting. I had it for over about 6 months before I decided to crack it open. The first time I wore it was about 3 weeks ago and I sprayed it on and thought - as I suspected, a predictable and unremarkable white floral but nice enough. However as the day wore on I kept catching a fresh spicy note and a warm cloud began to emerge. Not bad at all I thought. \n\nI wore it the following few days - unheard of for me, I change my perfume as often as I change my knickers. Fast forward a week and I was still reaching for it. Now, three weeks on I\u2019m wearing it again and it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019ve fallen in love with this beautifully put together perfume. \n\nGivenchy doesn\u2019t disappoint. Lamenting the lost beauties in their range it\u2019s still reassuring that they still got it. Beautiful. Just beautiful.", "40": "In early 2019 I was shopping for a new perfume. I usually gravitate towards bottles with a bit more color and that looks and sounds more sensual. So I never even gave l'interdit my attention. Thank god for the clerk who told me to try it. It went in my nose and straight to my heart. And that rarely happens with me because I'm picky. I would define the scent as sparkly sweet white flowers, boozy woods with slices of syrupy pears. When I spray this on, I feel like a CLASSY and sophisticated young woman who always flys business class and stays in 5 star hotels during her trips. Shes always lovely, elegant and approachable. Shes not complicated but there's something mysterious about her smile. You'd catch her chilling out in lounges and speak-easy bars. She's the kind of girl with many layers. L'interdit means \"forbidden\" in French. Perhaps behind that elegance and modesty, she has some sensual secrets ;)\n\nStaying power and projection: 4/5 *", "41": "Beautiful white flowers, heavy and with a big sillage. Vanilla adds a sweet creaminess, it is very well done.", "42": "This served as a great reminder that I don't know everything and I need to stop writing perfumes off before smelling them. I assumed L'Interdit would be a cloying, sweet mess but it's nothing of the sort and I absolutely adore it. \n\nI'm gonna say it... L' Interdit is the best Givenchy fragrance I've ever smelled. It has just the right balance of floral, fruity, sweet and earthy woodsy notes. It's those non-sweet elements which counteract the vanilla yumminess so well and makes it semi-gourmand instead of full on sugar cake. \n\nThe opening of citrus and juicy, pulpy pear is followed by a modestly bubblegum-y tuberose paired with a beautiful, slightly indolic Jasmine and bright orange blossom. These 3 florals are in perfect unison throughout the mid. Beneath this floral-fruity harmony is a dry, earthiness of vetiver and lovely creaminess of vanilla that is always present, but gradually becomes the bulk of the scent as it dries down and the lovely florals are pulled way back. The patch is an after thought, which was a good move for this fragrance. It deepens things slightly. There is a special menthol - like quality about the fragrance as well, which lifts it and keeps it from ever being too sweet or too much. \n\nWhat's most interesting is its transition between opening and mid to base. After about 45 minutes when the floral heart tapers off, it becomes dryer and less sweet. The menthol aspect sticks around but gradually lessens. I get a nod to something old school, perhaps an homage to the original that  Audrey Hepburn wore, which I've never smelled. The pear manages to bleed itself into the base, at which stage has become a little bit spicy. The vanilla paired with this scratchy dryness is divine. All of this, to end on a note of....Root beer? Yup! The final hours of L'Interdit smells like a dry ol' mug of root beer and that's fine by me. \n\nI expected to smell similarities to JPG La Belle as they both contain pear, vanilla and vetiver, and indeed there are moments when one reminds me of the other. But they are very different in fact. Where La Belle takes the easy road  to smelling like a treat, L'Interdit is not totally centered in edible territory and has an elegant softness to it, which the former lacks imo. It is very long lasting, but not loud or obnoxious in any way.\n\nFor a sweet designer fragrance, by Givenchy no less, I'm taken aback by its uniqueness and the way it develops through layers of subtle complexities. It strikes such a mood and checks all the boxes for me when it comes to this style of perfume. It's interesting, intoxicating and it doesn't end on a flat note, which is a big plus. While testing it my sister commented excitedly, \"It's you. It's a YOU fragrance!\" And I share the same sentiment. We clicked right away. \ud83d\ude09\n\nI love when a perfume comes along and proves my skeptical self wrong. I guess designer houses still can surprise. I just didn't guess Givenchy would be the next to do it. \ud83d\ude01", "43": "Absolute class! L'Interdit is just a suave embrace of white floral bliss.\nIt's like a wedding dress: radiant, innocent and yet alluring, dreamy and sexy.\nNo point comparing this with the previous Interdit; they are generations apart, spirit apart, distinctively separated by times.\n\nThis is an amazing fragrance, suitable for both day and night, office and private life. \nThe tuberose here is a Queen of discreet charm, enchanting without being vulgar. \nIt's simply a 10/10, well done Givenchy!\n\nFirst and only scent I've ever loved made by this house... And I'm not ordinarily someone who loves/wear tuberose!!", "44": "I confess, I love sweet scents. L'Interdit gives me a big hit of sweetness, chic and elegant florals, and a lightly woody dry down.

This is my favorite so far.\n\nIt's a chameleon to me. It's a little bit gourmand, with the pear and vanilla. It's a little bit chypre with the patchouli and bergamot thing going on, but the decadent white florals make it more complex. \n\nVery nice longevity, moderate sillage, lingers for ages on clothing.\n\nA lot of the reviews here focus on the reformulation, the comparison with the vintage version of this name... I could not care less about all of that. I never smelled the original, and I don't even want to, I doubt it could be better than this. I'll be getting a full bottle as soon as possible.", "47": "The first edp i have bought in 21 months.  It smells different & interesting - not like all the other generic women perfurmes nowadays.

A high end grape jolly rancher, or other hard candy...  Not cloying - the right amount of sweetness with the right amount of floral.  I think it would be a cold weather fragrance for me.  That Dominique Ropion, I think he is the nose behind about half of the fragrances I love :)", "49": "Have tried couple of times at Sephora. I love this one. Smell gorgeous and stays for hours on my skin and days on fabric. The best of it that the scent was the same from time to time. I didnt experience some kind of notes transition... only the opening that has this burst sensation, fresh, citrusy, fruits sweetness and then this tuberose played the  dominant role. This one is very special.. better tuberose notes compare to Jo Malone Angelica Tuberose or Boucheron Tuberose. Givenchy Le Interdit is my choice. Score is 9 /10."}, "57": {"0": "Take the smoky rose from Portrait of a Lady, the dry spicy woods from Creed Royal Oud, a touch of fruity sweetness, throw in some wildcard notes like flax and magnolia and hope for the best.. oh and dont forget to turn performance up to absolute maximum.\nToyBoy is a Winner!", "1": "strong opening of bergamot, red berries, elemi and a strong nutmeg that touches the throat. it would appear to be a woman's perfume.\nthe cloves annoy me and much, then something very overwhelming comes along, I think it's the green pear tree but the scent is always stronger, nauseating and feminine, green and acrid also because a very strong rose appears and remains . the rest is a faint flax flower, a slight vetiver, magnolia and cashmeran and I think a slight ambermax which is a note that I don't know but if it should be similar to amber ... it doesn't have the same smell and sylkolide as written in the Note. that is a sintetic notes.\nin summary for me one of the main notes that I smell are a strong bergamot, elemi, nutmeg cloves, green and pink notes.\nI would call it a citrus-green-spicy-rose-magnolia parfum.\nit is definitely a metrosexual perfume for the night. also for women.\nthe thing I like is that it is also summer and finally a summer that is different from the usual citrus-aquatic parfumes.\nincredible performances.", "2": "this perhaps is one of the best unique releases of 2019, beautiful fruity dark fragrance with hint of raisins, pepper and incense to my nose.very long lasting, playful, can be unisex too and i LOVE the bottle. projects well also, will be great for cooler evenings out.must try I would say.\n9/10 for amazing bottle and unique juice with great performance.", "3": "Again...

Actually, it smells so close to L\u2019interdit however for some reason that perfume is praised to the gods? Anyway.. this perfume is beautiful! The tuberose and orange blossom, much like in L\u2019interdit, translate to a grapey accord. However, unlike L\u2019interdit, the combination of bergamot and orange blossom do add a little citrus note in here that in my opinion balances the fragrance a lot better and also gives its a brighter happier feel! Some reviewers have noted they smell a red berry, perhaps strawberry, and although that isn\u2019t listed I do get that just a tiny bit. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have picked up on that had I not read about it. I almost get an orange creamsicle vibe from this! It\u2019s really pleasant, and between this and L\u2019interdit I prefer My Way because of its brightness and sparkle! Also that bottle.... it\u2019s just beautiful. One thing that was holding me back are the bad reviews on this one that frankly I think are silly. While I believe, obviosuly, not everyone is going to like the fragrance, I just can\u2019t get behind these \u2018basic\u2019 \u2018generic\u2019 \u2018not ground breaking\u2019 statements!  \nMy Way is bright and gleaming and more unique than most designer fragrances.   \nCheers!", "4": "I'm team \"unimpressed\" with My Way. Boring, uninspired, yet another sweetened fruity-white floral designer scent. If you like Idole Lancome or Givenchy Irresistible - this is likely up your alley, although of these three I'd probably pick Irresistible--it has a tad more character in this bunch of fruity floral syrupy mass appealing scents. At least Irresistible has more distinct drydown. But back to My Way:\n1. The name is stupid. It evokes Frank Sinatra allusion but in reality there is no glamour, no spicy danger, no lavish parties vibe, just... another nice scent that you would never remember had it not been for the Armani name on it.\n2. I would wear this on days when I just don't know what I want to wear, just something pleasant and feminine.\n3. It opens up great: juicy fruity bubble gum, almost red currant-raspberry like, but this quickly fades to sweetened pear and vanilla and nice orange blossom and tuberose. Nice, just not nice enough for this beautiful bottle. (the bottle with this cap is indeed gorgoeus). \n4. It would easily appeal to almost everyone young or mature, so this is the main trap: it would be a safe gift and will probably end up with a few flankers. But this versatility is what kills the cat, it lacks character and whatever idea there was behind this, is drowned in the goal to make this a bestseller.

I don't know if this has been reformulated or not, but the Flowerbomb I know is a very feminine, pretty fragrance that makes me think of love and joy and all the good simple things in the world. If that makes it \"generic\" or \"boring\" or \"vanilla\" to some, then I'm sorry/not sorry to say that's all I want in my life - it may be a very \"safe\" fragrance but not all of us are thrill-seekers or sex kittens. I find it innocent and youthful, I don't think it's sexy - at least not Tom Ford or Mugler sexy. This is sweet and cuddly - it's like vanilla ice cream, it may not be everyone's favorite but virtually anyone can have some of it - it's universally appreciated.

No, it doesn't particularly smell like flowers. But you know what, it screams \"I'm Sexy and I know it!\", LOL! XD It's just so feminine, lively and sugary so I highly enjoy it. It is also very well done in it's composition as a whole, with it not being too heavy or too light but well balanced.  \nMany describe it as devastatingly sweet when it really isn't. It's more of a sophisticated sweetness but pails in comparison to powerhouse sweeties such as Britney Spears Fantasy. o.O And while you are being wrapped in it's lovely veil of refined sugar, bergamot, tea and floral notes...out comes this incredibly warm and inviting combo of patchouli and musk. I am truly not a fan of patchouli but the ways it's done here is perfection! :D  \nThis pretty baby is expensive but actually worth it cause it's a scent that is often imitated and never duplicated ( effectively anyway ;O) ). And it isn't a scent that I frequently smell on women. Sillage is great as I expected and the lasting power is good 6-8hrs.

It was in July, and the weather was typical for the season with grey skies, wind, 12 degrees celsius and foggy mountains. The vegetation was intensely green and the shore salty and wet by waves crashing in. We had our wedding portraits taken on the rocks by the sea, sea spray in our faces and all. Wood Sage and Sea Salt was a perfect choice. I don\u00b4t think a pretty rose/pink/fruit classic wedding day perfume would have fitted that moment at all.  \nWood Sage and Sea Salt is really close to everything that the shores of the northern sea smells like during summer. Herbal, salty, ocean but not \u201caqua\u201d, driftwood and seaweed. It is a summer scent, but has absolutely no trace of tropical or beachy stuff. To me it is safe and reminds me of my home.  \nIt\u00b4s not long lasting though, as I am sure everyone is aware by now. Does not leave much of a trail either.", "2": "I was lucky enough to get to sample this at a Jo Malone boutique this weekend. The sa's had a tester in the back room. It seemed odd to me that a beachy scent would be released in fall, but now I know why. This is not a summer beach scent. It makes me think of autumn and cooler weather. It's mostly a woody scent on me, with very little sea salt in the beginning. If you've smelled Kiehl's vanilla and cedarwood, this is slightly similar. It's warm and a good scent for cosy days and evenings. Maybe a beach at night with a bonfire? Haha. \nAnyway, I want it!!", "3": "This is really painful. It's the perfect 'North Sea' beach scent, and reminds me of my childhood in Holland, walking down the beach in mid winter. Refreshing and gorgeous. I love beach scents, and there are tropical ones aplenty, so this nordic take would just be perfect for the collection of beaches-in-a-bottle. \nI should be all over this, but I can't. It's too expensive for a fragrance that fades so fast, and is barely noticeable. Some suggest to layer it, but that to me defeats the purpose of this scent, which is so great and pure.  \nIf I have extra money falling into my lap (LOL) I will get this, until then it'll be a wish lister", "4": "Instant favorite for me, with reservations. Words to describe this scent are... sweet, comforting, uplifting, well balanced, relaxed. \nIt's not too woody, not too sweet, not too citrusy... just a balanced unisex fragrance. The sea salt unifies the notes and creates something unique and very pleasing. \nI haven't been able to find a similar scent to it. Why would I want to find another scent if I like this one? Well...longevity is 3 hrs max for me, spraying one liberal spray on wrist, chest, inside elbow, and two sprays directly on shirt. After 3 hrs, the scent is almost totally gone (no random whiffs) though I can still smell it on my wrist if I get close up. \nI've only ever had samples of WS&SS and each time I've gone through the sample with 2 applications. Perhaps I'm not used to the concentration of Jo Malone scents, but it's disappointing considering how good WS&SS smells when first sprayed and in the first 30 minutes of wearing. \nI don't mind doing touch-ups, but I'd imagine this could easily use 3-4 sprays throughout the day to maintain/bring back the scent. \nIf anyone has a recommendation on something similar but with better staying power, send me a message. However, when I've looked through reviews or googled it, most recommended fragrances smell like the \"idea\" of marine/ocean smell, as opposed to the warm, sweet, unique, RELAXING smell of WS&SS. \nI am willing to work with it though, and for now, this is my favorite smell. I went to the Jo Malone counter at Nordstrom and the lady gave me a scent-pairing recommendation of this fragrance with Lime Basil & Mandarin and she sprayed 4 huge sprays of each scent, on each wrist... so maybe that's the application standard they have for these light scents... \nSide note... I disliked this scent mixed with Lime Basil & Mandarin, but really enjoyed the pairing of WS&SS with Oud & Bergamot. Really enjoy Oud & Bergamot as a cold weather scent. \nThanks for reading!"}, "61": {"0": "After 3 years testing more than 200 fragrances on a lifetime mission to find my signature scent, I have to say this is the King! The most kind and inviting King of them all. \nFirst, about the EDT x EDP debate. EDP is a denser and creamer version, it has that cozy vibe and could be a better option when it gets really cold and if you dig so much into bleu's scent that you are willing to pay more for a denser-cozy winter and/or more mature version. It lasts a bit more but it does not project as much. As soon as weather hits really low, I tend to wear spicier frags to warm things up, so EDT for me is the best bang for my buck and my wearings, as i love Bleu as a signature scent not as a ''cold night special event'' frag. \nEDT is louder, crispier and sporty, but both are versatile. EDP is easily unisex IMO.  \nFirst time I used it (EDT) I though it was nice but not a 'wow' worthy fragrance, and that was totally a misconception that I had at the time about the proposal of this fragrance. \nAfter testing dozens and dozens of other frags, niches included, Bleu was always coming back as an intriguing inviting smell. It's simple but complex in its composition, so much as it was impossible to find this kind of simplicity/quality on other fragrances! ...and believe me, I've tried. \nThe incense fruity vibe, the impeccable vetiver (probably one of the best vetiver uses from this decade), makes this fragrance really hard to replace and duplicate. Young women usually don't like heavy-loaded vetiver male fragrances, it pushes that old uncle vibe, but Bleu's vetiver is precisely crafted to counter attack the fruity/spicy aspects and so it delivers an amazing overall young male vibe!   \nBleu is the easiest option to please the female audience for some reasons, it's inviting and kind to their noses, it's probably not the most complimented fragrance because it doesn't project as much as some niche fruity frags and some ambroxan bombs out there, but as soon as women fell this scent, they are in heaven!  \nIt awesomeness lies on its ingredients and well-balanced composition, it's distinct on the sum of its parts, not on single aspects.  \nSorry haters, but this is an amazing composition, better than most niche fragrances out there, Coco would've been proud!", "1": "The negative reviews of Bleu De Chanel EDT are largely a result of \"Group-think\". If enough reviewers on Youtube say it's so, then it must be so.  \nBleu De Chanel EDT spawned an entire generation of \"Blue\" fragrances. It did not do so out of mediocre craftsmanship. This fragrance is singular.  \nDespite the hordes of blue frags still being made today, each pathetic progeny is more heinous than the next. Bleu De Chanel EDT is so different from the rest of the blue fragrances, simply because each successive release added a new element in order to slightly distinguish itself. As a result, none of the later blue frags smell like BDC EDT. \nInvictus added too much aquatic sweetness, YSL Y EDP added too much fruitiness, Dylan Blue and others added too much shower gel, Sauvauge added too much of everything. Those are the fragrances that compose the \"blue\" hashtag. BDC EDT spawned the blue, but shares nothing in common with them, besides the name. \nBDC EDT is a refined, masculine, fresh smelling fragrance that harkens back to a timeless mens \"cologne\", while adding more modern notes and longevity.", "2": "this is the perfume the love of my life used to wear and now he is dead...... the scent itself is beautiful and now it is going to stay very special for me forever ...

The opening is so refreshing and enticing , which might do some justice to the word 'bleu' in the name (bleu in a way, although not at all an aquatic as the name might suggest). Soon, incense and ginger come forward and the grapefruit lurks around in the shadows. This phase, essentially remains the same throughout its drydown.\n\nA safe yet interesting composition, this works great as an office scent, or your hanging out with friends scent or simply a white tee and denims scent.

Is BdC my favorite fragrance? No, not at all.  Is this my most versatile fragrance?  Quite possibly!  Along with Dolce & Gabbana Pour Homme, BdC can be worn anytime, anyplace, and in any setting...and you will never feel out-of-place. It's just a very pleasing, highly-versatile fragrance. Is is perhaps a bit boring to some of us fragrance-heads?  Sure, but even the most ardent hater of all things mainstream and/or baloney-coloney gotta give it some respect.\n\nPeople love this scent (lots of compliments) and it is suitable whether you are getting married or being buried; whether you're out clubbing or being arraigned in front of a judge...it just works, and it works well for its intended purpose. It's maximum likability in a bottle which, if you think about it, makes this fragrance quite lovable.\n\nPerformance is moderate to slightly above average as this fragrance lasts 6-8 hours on my skin and projects moderately, which is fine for this type of scent. Overall, I give it a very strong like but I simply cannot love it for the reasons mentioned above. Moreover, I recommend Bleu de Chanel to any gentleman who just want to smells great, doesn't want to spend a ton of money, and who doesn't wish to think about fragrance...this is a dumb-reach for 90% of men IMO.", "7": "In my opinion, Bleu is the best male scent Chanel has created, and I like them all.\n\nThis is not so much as review as a defense of the scent: It's really curious how divisive this cologne has been among the fragrance enthusiast sites, yet how consistently it's mentioned to garner compliments.\n\nThe main complaint seems to be that it's generic, too similar to other things, too bland. But I think people are confusing \"genericness\" with balance. Lot's of fragrance buffs like scents with a well-defined, character, and they seem to feel that Chanel doesn't have this. I would disagree. It's not just a single-minded character like most fragrances; rather it's multifaceted, where there is more than meets the eye.\n\nThe thing about Bleu is that, as suggested by its advertising, it's a mass-market, all-use scent. And to me, it does that virtually perfectly. I find it hard to think of many other colognes that can be used absolutely any time of the year(and do it *well*) the way Bleu can. It's fresh enough to deal with hot weather, yet warm enough to inspire closeness on a cold night. It's incredibly multi-layered, and I always seem to be discovering a new layer to it.\n\nIf my description doesn't seem convincing, just read through the plethora of reviews and impressions here and other enthusiast places, and compare them to those of other scents. It's common for a scent to be divisive(A*men), but usually because of preferences, not descriptions. I mean here we have a scent with more user votes than 90% of the fragrances on this site at over 1600, and yet as of this writing, there are only two votes for a \"reminds me of\" with one Boss fragrance, and looking through the reviews, the discrepancy of comparisons is huge for a scent with so many reviews.\n\nIf you want more proof of how balanced and multi-layered it is, look at the votes for when it should be worn. It's very evenly spread out for all four seasons, as well as day and night usage. Again, can't think of anything else that achieves such a balance. That's remarkable.\n\nSpeaking on a personal level now I find my greatest issue with it is that I can't decide whether it's something I want to wear as an every day scent, or only for special occasions. Again, that's a quality I'm not used to seeing: being able to easily be used as an everyday casual scent, or only for nights out and special occasions. \n\nI think part of the problem is that a lot of fragrance lovers try to pick out smells with clearly and easily identifiable character, so that they don't smell like anything else. Bleu, on the other hand, is eclectic in it's scent, drawing from spicy and fresh, yet also warm and musky. I think it's character is clear, yet not necessarily easy to define. It's eclecticism means can adapt to your own character. You can be who you want to be, rather than just letting the cologne dictate something about you.\n\nIf anything, Bleu will just dictate that you smell good. Despite divisiveness, most seem to agree this is a huge compliment getter. Even those who don't like it. While I don't wear scents just to appeal to other people, if people are complimenting you, it's because you smell good, simple as that.\n\nTo me, Bleu is extremely far from generic. It's mysterious, it's multifaceted. It's the fragrance version of a polymath, of the quintessential Rennaissance man, and if it seems devoid of character, it's because it allows room for you to complement it with your own.", "8": "Bleu de Chanel EDT\n\nThe original of the blue line that its competitors over the last decade have tried to emulate, one perhaps successfully and others less so.\n\nBleu de Chanel and Dior Sauvage are uniquely excellent freshies that seem to be sitting comfortably at the top of the fragrance pile.\n\nLinnear yes, but whom wants change when they open and remain this good.\n\nBoth reasonably affordable with excellent performance and longevity, and i for one don't care what their critics say.\n\nLong may they reign.\n\nUPDATE: \n\nBleu de Chanel EDP & Dior Sauvage EDP. \n\nBoth i now prefer over the EDTs, more refined, elegantly masculine and mature.

You let 100 average people (not fragrance enthusiasts!) smell BDC and I'm guessing 98 of them will like it, and probably 85 of them will *really* like it. \n\nMost men just want to smell clean, masculine, and pleasant.  The average man doesn't want to be wearing some heavy oud fragrance and hear \"Hey what's the moldy wood smell in here?\" (legit I heard this wearing a fragrance with an oud base lol) or wear something overly sweet, or feminine/unisex feeling.   Even more so, most women want their men to smell clean and masculine as well!\n\nBDC is a clean, masculine, and pleasant fragrance in a nearly perfect way.

Although scent is a matter of personal taste, I am reminded of my opening quote while reading over the reviews. \n\nI agree it is NOT boring or generic at all. For me it's very refreshing and layered. There is a rich creamy quality to it. It starts out citrus. A little green and minty, but gives way to fresh, cool woods.

Enjoy its richness.   \n\nDespite the tepid reception here, it will be a success and very deservedly so.

This is the one that reinvented contemporary \u201cblue\u201d perfumery and is still undefeated, largely responsible for the abundance of ambroxan bombs these days.\nAt least know what you\u2019re talking about before comments like that lol.\nSure it\u2019s safe for some but it was quite complex for its time, seamlessly smooth and as usual with Chanel oozes class.

Which is a bit unfortunante cause there are so many other fragrances I love so much but never recieve any compliments.\n\nBut in the end of the day, it's not about the compliments I recieve, but it's about wearing what I want to wear and what I love.\n\nWhen I first bought Bleu I was a bit disappointment because it felt boring (I was used to the Niche heavy hard-hitters) where as Bleu is transparent and subtle. I was also afraid that it would have low longivity based on how it felt on my first couple wearings.\n\nBut over time Bleu grew on me and has become one of my favorites. It just perfects what's it what intended to do. Bleu doesn't smell cheap, wearing bleu trained my nose to make my other Chanels (Edition Blanche and AHS..) and virtually all my other designers smell much cheaper in comparison.\n\nBleu is probably the most versatile fragrance I have (exception, probably not best for the winter cold)\n\nThe longvity is not as short as I was first feared it was going to be, infact, it seemed like the more I wore it the longer the longivity got (I think my nose learned to pick up on the little things that I first missed). Most of the time, people can smell this on me after 7+ hours of me wearing it, but I cannot really smell it on myself after 4 hours, but i'll still preiodically get wiffs of this after that.\n\nIf many people really think Bleu is a 'generic' scent, then I'll have to say Bleu is a 'generic' masterpiece.", "22": "This is what I call my Chanel for Bleu Jeans fragrance and I will tell you why. There have been quite a few reviews below decrying Bleu de Chanel as being disappointing. Not up to the standards of pervious Chanel scents. So this is my experience with the fragrance. \n\n     While shopping a month or so back for a new Chanel I picked up Egoiste Platinum (see my review on that if you are interested) and while I was looking at the various Chanels for men to expand my horizons and add to my one and only Pour Monsieur the salesperson asked if she could spay some Bleu on a card for me. I said sure, why not? I could take in maybe one more sniff before my nose closed up shop. Well, that one little sniff blew my Bleu socks off! I almost bought it on the spot but had already set my shopping limit for the month. So I filed my Bleu card away for a future purchase. \n\n   Last Saturday it was so incredibly beautiful here in San Francisco and on a gorgeous day lots of San Franciscan naturally hightail it for our magnificent shopping district around Union Square. I was moved by sun and blue skies to visit our Chanel Boutique. I dressed for the occasion since I am old fashioned and think one should never leave the house on a shopping expedition looking less than smashing. Black Jeans, black cashmere turtle neck, black spit shined loafers, chunky steel bracelet, a not so chunky yet stylish gunmetal watch and a pair of Ray Ban Wayfarers. One quick check in the mirror and I set off for my adventure.\n\n   I was in and out of Chanel so fast that the door on Maiden Lane didn\u2019t have a chance to close. Then I popped over to have a light lunch at the Sir Francis Drake and following that headed home to un-box my little treasure. I really got a kick out of the bottle, a kind of film noir blue black moderne take on the No.5 bottle design with a really nifty cap that is magnetized so that it clicks back on in the same position with the locked double C\u2019s always facing front perfectly. A nice touch don\u2019t you think? I sprayed my wrist and sniffed\u2026. Hum? Then I sprayed my collar bone. \u201cThat\u2019s odd, it\u2019s kind of\u2026.hum?\u201d I thought.  And a final spritz behind my ears. \n\n    It was not at all what it had seemed in the store the month before. What had happened?  Where was that oh my god sensation?  It was nice, it was interesting, and it was perfectly fine. But something was missing. As the day wore on I discovered it has some wonderful aspects about it. I love how the incense, ginger and peeper all work together and it lasted on me a reasonable 5 to 6 hours. Yet still I was vaguely disappointed.  During the week at work it drew rave reviews. And that puzzled me. THEY loved it; they wanted to know what it was that made it so unique and exciting.  Why did they find it so wonderful and I found it to be just \u2026fine?  To me it wasn\u2019t the magic Chanel we all dream of, what we hope to find in each new Chanel offering. It was just dare I say it, a work-a-day Chanel.\n\n   Then it hit me. It smelled just the same as it had in the store; the only thing that had changed was me. I had been obsessing over that smell for over a month, and in that time I had turned that sense memory of Bleu into something it could not live up to. No perfume could. I had let the aura and history of \u201cChanel\u201d out Chanel the Chanel!  It was fine and I liked it just fine, and that is fine. Not every Chanel or any other perfume house can hit it out of the park each time. But what Chanel did with Bleu de Chanel was make a good everyday perfume. Something nice to throw on when you feel like being casual and elegant around your frayed edges, like a pair of comfortable blue jeans. They fit well and you know exactly what to expect from them, and they are classics in their own way. So that is why I call my Bleu de Chanel my Chanel for blue jeans. \nFour Gold Stars. ****", "23": "Allure goes aqua. A lovely combo that keeps shifting.

Not extreme as in a powerful scent, but give it an extra spray or two more than usually and I get an ok 5-6 hours of longevity. \n\nGreat fragrance and a definite love from me!", "6": "Not a Private Blend, yet to my nose still one of the best Tom Ford fragrances.\n\nHeavily and heavenly gourmand, mixes the intensity of the Indian dessert with other sweet accords but never gets cloying or too \"in your face\".\n\nDespite the sweetness, I still perceive this one as rather masculine. Comparisons to Spicebomb are reasonable, I like the TF a lot better though.\n\nGreat for winter wear, not a performance beast though.", "7": "Look, I'm not going to waste time with a long review.\n\nIf you're looking to smell sexy...no, ALLURING.

You'll find that more mature women can't get enough of it while younger women will think it's \"just ok\".\n\nBut it is one of the best on the market and I'm baffled as to why this isn't a Private Blend scent.", "8": "To whoever saying that this has an old lady smell, you know nothing at all, just cause there\u2019s a rose note smh, at this point, stick to your Lacoste and Calvin klein fragrances\nThis stuff smells expensive and masculine\n\nDefinitely 10/10", "9": "This is one hell of a gorgeous scent, fell in love since the first whiff, lol. Despite it's name, it's not extreme, it's not loud or anything. It's actually extremely pleasant to wear and the dry down is simply magical. This is by far my favorite fragrance. When i wear it, i spray it on my writs as well and i catch myself smelling my wrist every day. \n\nIt's a creamy scent, you can smell the vanilla/sweet spices and the amber. \n\nPerformance could have been better, but one can't have it all right? It get's a 9.9/10 for me!", "10": "8/23/19\nI'm a woman, and I got this as a sample with a sephora order. I usually give my fiance the samples of cologne that I receive, but I always spray them on myself to see what they smell like so that I can recommend which one I think he should wear.  Once I sprayed this on my wrist, I could NOT stop smelling it!  It smells amazing, so amazing that I've been spraying it on myself to wear because I love it so much..... like to the point where I'm apprehensive to wash the clothes I spray it on because I know I just have a tiny sample that won't last very long. It just smells so sophisticated and sensual.  Now, I'm not a scent expert by any means, so this may sound ignorant or derisive, but the scent reminds me of my favorite Bath & Body Works candle, which is a mahogany teakwood scent, except this parfum is more complex and has a spicy/sweet side mixed with other notes that I can't pinpoint.  Now, normally I can't stand sweet notes, but this parfum is just a subtle sweetness and it's not the main component; it just adds to the complexity (for comparison, I think Black Opium smells too sweet).  All of the scent notes just blend in so effortlessly.  I love it.  Also, the scent lingers forever.  I haven't smelled anything so alluring and captivating in a long, long time.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive, I was SO sad when my sample ran out :( :(", "11": "Insanely, incomprehensibly, irreversibly, intoxicatingly infatuated.\n\nThat's me after having just tried a sample of this.\n\nWow - just... wow.\n\nDamn you, Tom Ford - are you trying to get ALL of my money?

My nose isn't as well developed as some folks here that can pick out alot of the notes but for me it's good and that's all that matters to me. Oh and i have to add this is my first tom ford, and definitely will give more of my money to this brand, especially Oud wood and Oud Fleur from the private blend series which the SA let me try.", "13": "I also didn\u2019t realize that this fragrance was geared towards men. I\u2019ve been wearing it and I love it for autumn evenings. It comes across as very unisex to me. \n\nThis scent is stunning. I loooove the warm and cozy spices in this fragrance. I don\u2019t think cinnamon is listed as a note, but I get a delicious cinnamon-vanilla blend with that earthy nutmeg and a sensual rose note. It kind of smells like chai tea spices, but more creamy. It\u2019s sexy, spicy, sweet, rich, elegant and comforting. I don\u2019t find it overpowering at all, but I also ensure to not overspray. One spritz will do for me.\n\nThe packaging is of course a 10/10 for me.", "14": "I'm Indian and I love Khulfi! This was one of our favourite go-to desserts before the Western ice cream brands made their way to the East, taking down this all natural dessert and replacing it with the artificially processed flavoured ice cream. \n\nThis isn't a rant, lol. I just wanted to say that it's been awhile since I'd tasted the Khulfi, as it is now a little harder to find...especially in the US. \n\nBut Tom Ford does it again for me! This fragrance, the Noir Extreme, brings back all the cherished Khulfi-sweet memories of my childhood - just fabulous, FABULOUS blend!\n\nOne complaint though, I just wish this one lasted a bit longer than it actually does - only 4 hrs on my skin!\n\nOh well, at least it is 4 hrs of heavenly nostalgia for me.

This scent is totally unisex but marketing sometimes can throw us off right? \n\nI found this while out with a girlfriend, she decided to sample it on paper thinking it was a womans scent. I fell in love. It was everything I had been looking for, it was spicy and a bit sweet and had the most delectable vanilla dry down ever. I have always had trouble find fragrances for myself because while I am very feminine, I cannot stand feminine fragrances. It seems like it is always the same thing over done to a point your head is clogged with florals and overly sweet gourmands. Not this, it stands on its own as a beautiful creamy and spicy potion. \n\nIt starts with a lot of nutmeg and sandalwood spice at opening, during dry down it picks up more of the citrus and saffron, then evens out into a beautiful arrangement of sandalwood and creamy amber vanilla. It sexy and so cozy, it makes me think of sitting in front of a fireplace reading a book while wearing a white cozy sweater with black lingerie underneath. In the office it would be an absolute powerhouse on any person who demands attention, and oh would they get it. \n\nSillage is moderate for me and longevity about 4-6 hours which is not that good for Tom Ford. I am considering purchasing the body spray since it is cheaper and absolutely dousing myself in it. \n\nI have also compared this to Pour Femme. I love both but in totally different ways. Pour Femme is boozy while this is spicy and creamy. I think both a very versatile but Pour Femme seems more fitting for a night out whereas Noir Extreme is for whenever. \n\nThis is my new signature scent!\n\nUpdate: Now we are into Black Orchid ;)", "20": "One of the very few fragrances marketed towards men that made me fall in love at first sniff.

Lavish, lyrical and redolent with notes of vintage Shalimar (No, not exactly the same, but attaining that register for me), Noir Extreme is joy for a man. Wear it in a crowded room and softly state your presence. Wear it in an empty room and you will contemplate the moment, the way all lovely things cause one to do. Always a BFF, Noir Extreme is open handed and loving like a giddy satyr who is also your blood brother and will never hurt you. Here is a promise kept, sweet affirmation: a gentle, rosy waterfall of Tom Ford luxury. Noir Extreme is just the best for chasing away or bringing on the shivers during cold winter nights under the flannel sheets. The more you wear it, the more you love to wear it. The profile remains familiar like an old country house and yet exalted like a formal garden. It took me about six months to get hooked, and just like any clandestine love affair, about a year for it to become my signature (at least for now). I can barely wait to replace it with something else so I can long to wear it again. Yes, it\u2019s like that.", "24": "I find it difficult to describe this fragrance.\nA couple of hours into wearing it i am wrapped in the warmth of the amber and vanilla, but it 's the opening that i wish would stick around.\nSaffron, nutmeg and cardamomis such a lovely smooth spiciness rather than the alternative of a sharp citrus/peppery opening, and i think that is what this fragrance is boiled down to. Smoothness. It goes on like a warm, gooey, exotic dessert but never going too overboard on gourman elements. Perfect balance of oriental and gourmand.\nGood longevity, enough projection (this is a proven compliment getter) and great for cold nights.", "25": "Oh this one is so sexy!\nI find it to be totally unisex, I like it better than Noir Pour Femme, as it is more rounded and has a less pronounced smoky note (if that makes sense).\nAlso I find it a little sweeter and less \u201cmasculine\u201d on my skin than on paper, which I am very happy about. \nIt lasts for about 5-6 hours with moderate projection, which is not ideal, but the 50ml bottle is just beautiful and worth having.\nIt\u2019s oriental, it\u2019s woody, warm spicy, gourmand-ish (though non edible) perfection on my skin.\nMy current favourite - love it and recommend it!", "26": "Utterly beautiful, spicy, gourmand and silky smooth sexiness!

It's so rich and sensual. I plan to wear this as often as I possibly can in the fall/winter and will enjoy every single second of it!  Always try first to see if it's full bottle worthy.

Richer, spicier, better balanced. Similar, that is to say substantial, longevity. This is a delicious, sensual fragrance. Not too sweet, but the spices+vanilla is one of the best in its category, and made more interesting by that smokiness. Not as harsh as an Amouage, and definitely not as incense-y. If I smelled this on another man, I'd want to take him to bed immediately. That said, I think this is a wonderfully unisex fragrance and showcases Tom Ford's ability to make something that has already been done new and newly extraordinary.", "36": "Absolutely beautiful edible/gourmand scent by the one and only Tom Ford.... Tom Ford is a mastermind and he knows exactly what he\u2019s  doing. When I first tried this scent I first thought it smelled like an old antique store. Idk why but it just had that old ,classic vibe to it anyways the next day I tried it on again but this time on my skin and yet again it still had that same vibe. BUT, a few hours later this \u201cold\u201d smell magically turned into that delicious kulfi note I was waiting for and MAN I love kulfi it\u2019s sweet,nutty, and u get a little spice note from that saffron yummmmmm\n\nInitial spray- 81/100 can be a little harsh in the beginning with that cardamom note.\nDry down- 97/100 the spices start to relax and the kulfi note starts to rise\n\nLongevity- 7.5 hours \nSillage - 2 hours and 15 mins\n\nOverall rating- 9/10", "37": "OH MY WORD!  amazing. gorgeous. alluring. complex. \n\nIts perfect.

So complex. long lasting. easily a 12 hour fragrance on my skin and projection for 6 hours...yet I got whiffs randomly on myself all the way until the 12 hour mark. Even a faint skin scent in the morning. \n\nWhat was remarkable was that after all the beautiful sweetness, spice, warmth started to soften after 8 hours, the funniest thing occurred. I started to get hints of all the beautiful florals again. Neroli, amber and orange blossom started to pop giving me an alluring, deep musk  bubble. Just incredible. Never has a one of TF's given me such an experience for the entire journey. \n\nA MUST HAVE!", "38": "A very alluring and groundbreaking scent. Easy for a woman to like on a man, a fragrance that evokes mystery and comfort.\nStarts very sharp and pungent, but dries into a more forgiving, lingering mist. At this point, the vanilla is sweet to the right measure and the spicy quality of Kulfi+Saffron makes anyone who smells it curious and wishful for another sniff.\nStellar longevity and good sillage, one of the safest options from TF and I'd classify it as a must buy for medium range collectors.\n\nPsycho Killer, performed by Talking Heads", "39": "I don't get the negativity for this...agreed it's a far step of the original, but I actually quite enjoyed this, && weak?! ya'll guys must have really dry skin && it's sucking this right up b/c I sprayed this on top my hand around 4pm today it's now 11pm && I can still visibly detect it, not as strong as the initial spray of course but it's there. I thought it had a different & interesting smell nothing really came into mind with similarity (of course I haven't smelled every scent out there) but this got my attention for it's uniqueness. \n\nI will say this is easily unisex which is prob why I enjoy this moreover the original, && I find extreme has a lil sex to it, The vanilla && kulfi give it a very alluring & intriguing smell one of them scents that would suck me right in if I smelled it on a guy...but hey I like it on me too so it's deff. a future contender for a new fall/winter scent. great job TF, but that price I mean it's TF but ouch! still love it though. ;)\n\nOverall: 9/10", "40": "It's a sexy bakery.  There are spicy cookies, sweet fluffy meringues and beautiful people dressed for work.  \nThis leans quite a bit towards the feminine on me (which is why I bought a FB).  The vanilla-spice vibe is by far the most forward.  It mellows down into something less spicy, a bit more woody vanilla after about an hour.  \nUnfortunately, the longevity is pretty poor for this price point.  Scent-wise I can't fault it - I love it!!  Longevity-wise - it's a disappointment.", "41": "Love it. This is a masterpiece. It\u2019s sweet yet complex. Sillage is great. Compliment getter.

Nonetheless, the frag is just fantastic. Typical TF DNA. This is not a casual fragrance, to me this is an occasion fragrance and when you wear it... u will feel edible. So now when I am going out.. & I am dressed up & want my fragrance to project (minus the oudy fragrances) this is my Go-to!", "42": "It is a cool winter here in Vancouver, with gusty winds, heavy rain and clouds in the sky. This morning I am wearing Tom Ford Noir Extreme, and this fragrance fits the climate I am in perfectly. This is a dark, sexy fragrance. It does not shout and while somewhat feminine to my nose, is almost masculine as well. This is not a fragrance for teenagers - better suited for men 25+. \n\nThis fragrance has milky/creamy qualities to it. The kulfi note, in particular, gives this fragrance a somewhat unique character to it. Sillage and longevity are both moderate on this scent, which is what I prefer. \n\nI would imagine someone well-dressed wearing this scent - possibly on a date in the evening (but could be worn during the daytime). It is sexy, warm and inviting with a slightly mysterious edge to it as well. \n\nThis is a great fragrance. I have had it in my collection for a few years and am revisiting it again as I want to get some more wearings of it before Springtime hits in my city and I opt for fresher scents.", "43": "Just got a 15ml decant. WOW I've been wearing this for 30 mins, and I had to post something that raves about it at least a little bit! I don't wanna go too gaga before I put it through the real trials, but I can tell that I'm going to love this scent. Keeping my fingers crossed that this will last on my skin. I don't even care about the projection, because I'd wear this just for me.\n\nMy initial impression gives me vibes of Spicebomb and (more so) Bvlgari Man In Black. However, this is by far more complete and more elegant. I'm engulfed in a wonderful creaminess, and the beautiful orange in the opening almost brought a tear to my eye. I'm currently left with a scent that is not Earth-shattering, but could be worth a full bottle if it performs well enough. C'mon fragrance Gods.... just gimme 8 solid hours... I don't ask for much!\n\nI will update this in 2-3 weeks time.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThis is tough. Once again I'm in a realm where I'm frustrated with a Tom Ford scent, but will likely end up buying it. This happened to me with Grey Vetiver, where I didn't feel like it was the best thing in the world, but it was special in a way I couldn't quite get from its closest competition. It wouldn't feel so frustrating if either fragrance performed better, or perhaps cost a chunk less. \n\nI've read some other reviews here to verify that I'm not crazy in referencing Spicebomb and BMIB. Noir Extreme is more special (scent-wise) than either of those. That heavenly opening would have me swiping my credit card immediately, if only it lasted longer than 15 mins. The orange does fall into the back seat after a while, but the spicy stage of Noir Extreme still has me intrigued for hours. I'm pretty sure that its actually sandalwood spice that cuts through, but its such a well blended fragrance that I can't tell which of the spicy notes is really drawing me in. Probably all of them. \n\nI got a really nice compliment from someone at a nighttime professional engagement, although that person was sitting directly next to me in a lecture hall about 45 minutes after I re-applied the scent. That's the kicker here. People around you will love it.... IF they can smell you. The performance here really is hovering in the range of bare minimum for me. I don't get the wondrous longevity that others have mentioned. The projection and sillage are polite, and they do their thing for maybe 3 total hours on me. I'll take the modest projection, but for a scent that is inherently nocturnal, it'd be nice if it could do it's job long enough for me to enjoy a whole night out. So I'm left frustrated that I might spend like $70 for 50ml of a scent that requires me to carry a decant, and/or spray a whole bunch of it. \n\nSpeaking of which, I suppose it is possible to overspray this, but I've been able to go quite liberal with it. 4 neck + 2 for the elbows + 2 on the back of the hands. What you'll end up with is a moderate-range bubble that is a wee bit strong, but not overkill. After an hour it's pretty close to you, so I don't think it's nuts to try and extend the range by spraying my extremities. You could go lighter for a date, and just keep your scent bubble less intense and close to you, whilst smelling amazing during a hug (a la D&G The One). \n\nMaybe you'll be luckier than me, but I'd carry a decant with me if I used this for a night on the town. \n\nBack to the scent: there's kind of a Spicebomb core, with the added class and maturity of BMIB, then even MORE class and maturity, and then replace the BMIB booziness with more of a creamy dessert tone. And when I say creamy, I mean that Kulfi laying down a milky, mouth-watering, \"I-wish-I-knew-what-Kulfi-actually-tastes-like\" kind of tone. You can almost feel the yummy dairy on your tongue as the spices tingle your olfactive nerve in a delectable way (which is where the La Nuit comparison comes into play). The orange is still alive in there somewhere, but it's become more of a supportive character to help induce a wide-band gourmand experience.\n\nIt's definitely down to a skin scent within 4-5 hours on me, and that stage still smells nice, but it's more pedestrian in the \"leftover vanilla\" range... with perhaps some powder leftover from the spices. \n\nI've got plenty of this left, so I'll take a break for a while and give it another big trial as the weather cools. It took me a long time to convince myself to buy Grey Vetiver, but I don't know if Noir Extreme will be able to reach into my pocket so easily. I was sure that Grey Vetiver filled a unique roll in my wardrobe, while Noir Extreme is slightly redundant of other fragrances I could easily use instead. I doubt I'll be able to forget that wonderful creamy Kulfi note, or the way that it sort of dual-attacks with the spicy notes... so maybe it's special enough for me to fork out the cash.\n\nOverall: I'd suggest sampling before buying. I realize that some people (including myself at first) do a wild backflip over this one, but it's only so special. And even if the scent does wow you, you may not have lucky skin in terms of performance. It's expensive enough where you may have to waffle over purchasing it, which is where I'm going to be for a couple of months.", "44": "Sonia Constant is a genius. Hands down, no doubt about it.

The actual flavour that comes when you eat all this mixture with the leaves is amazing!. \n\nThis smell is actually that of Pan and Kulfi mix from the first 2 mins till the dry down. Initial spray you will get fresh and sweet, middle rose, sweet and vanilla till the dry down. I personally don't like vanilla, but in this the way Tom ford has mixed it is amazing. It's like an unobstructed presence. I was literally getting wafts of pan Kulfi, vanilla and amber after 10 hours and got a compliment in an elevator. Your girl won't stop sniffing at you, this is an amazing scent.

Ani is gorgeous beyond description. Longevity is unbelievable. I get 24 hours on skin and over two weeks on clothing, with very heavy projection. A very tangy, slightly floral green vanilla.

I would wear this in any season, aside from outdoors in high heat.

It sparkles like diamonds and has this radiating vanilla glow which emerges, dissipates and re-emerges throughout the heart of the fragrance. It is subtle enough to wear on a regular basis which makes it versatile. It leaves a scent trail but does not project far, to be honest I prefer my fragrances to be more intimate rather than loud and attention grabby. \nThe opening is fresh and green, reminds me a little bit of ginger beer with a slight citrus note. One thing to be aware of is that everyone has different skin and some notes are absorbed more than others by our skin. Therefore you may not experience the fragrance as it was intended, it's all dependent on your skin chemistry. For instance, I don't smell the blackcurrant in this fragrance... however when I spray on my clothes I get a sweet blackcurrant note in the background. \nI bought a 100ml bottle since I can't live without this one (I wish this one was cheaper), strangely I wear this before going to sleep because I find it so comforting. \nIf this one ever gets reformulated it would be an absolute loss to the fragrance world.

One spray is an all day, soft, sweet skin scent. 2 sprays, warm and gingery cookie, projecting a bit. 3 sprays, a slightly more masculine and spicy balsamic ginger bergamot with vanilla, strong projection, lasting 24+ hours on skin.

I'm sure this will get very popular.", "14": "Nishane Ani opens with a moderate projection of bergamot, ginger, and pink pepper. The opening feels citrusy and very spicy. The bergamot note is short-lived, soon green notes, evocative of fresh herbs come up and join the blend enhancing the ginger. In just a moment the black currant and cardamon join with their spicy accords. The black currant is more noticeable and it adds a sharp berry-like, fruity, slightly sour tone. The Turkish rose is just a faint touch. In just a moment the base notes join but they are not as prominent as the black currant or ginger. They add a combination of soft green, a touch of musk, and some woody accords. The vanilla adds a mild sweet accord but nothing prominent. The most noticeable changes from the opening to the dry-down are the gradual fading of the bergamot and green notes, the black currant becomes more and more prominent and seats side by side with the ginger. Also, the woodsy accords of the base become more clear towards the dry-down but are not as prominent as the black currant or ginger. Once Nishane Ani has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, slightly sweet, black currant and ginger fragrance with woody, spicy, and very soft musky, green, and floral accords. The fragrance feels earthy, exotic, masculine, modern, rare, rich, sharp, special, spicy, unique, slightly woody, and very pleasant.\n\nBATCH REVIEWED: 2020\nWOW RATING: 10/10. The combination of slightly sweet black currant and ginger is impressive.\nDISLIKE RATING: 1/10. Unlikely but the prominent black currant and ginger notes could be offensive to some individuals.\nUNIQUENESS: 10/10. The combination of notes creates a unique and easy to recognize fragrance.\nMASS APPEAL: 7/10. Above average, but not the mass-appeal fragrance.\nPROJECTION: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet around the wearer.\nSILLAGE: 4/10. Moderate, about 4 feet around the wearer.\nAPPLICATION: Four atomizations will suffice. More will increase performance but not make the fragrance offensive.\nLONGEVITY: 4/10. About 4 hours with 2 of moderate projection.\nSEASONS: Any, the spicy nature of the fragrance makes it ideal for the colder months; the fruity and slightly citrus character favors warmer months.\nOCCASIONS: Formal events, outdoor gatherings, office, business, casual, holidays, clubbing. This is an office-friendly fragrance. \nVERSATILITY: 9/10. This is a highly versatile fragrance.\nGENDER: Unisex. Advertised as unisex, the spicy and woody accords create a small tilt to the masculine side.\nAGES: 30 and above.\nRECOMMENDATION: Nishane Ani can be found discounted for somewhere between $200 and $300. The fragrance is unique, highly versatile, niche-quality, however, its price is beyond what the fragrance delivers. This is a nice-to-have, but not a must-have.\nBLIND-BUY: No, sample it first.\nSIMILAR: Nishane Ani brings the combination of black currant and ginger to a new level.\nSUMMARY: A moderate projection, slightly sweet, black currant and ginger fragrance with woody, spicy, and very soft musky, green, and floral accords.

A quintessential spicy-vanilla scent that will envelop any room you walk into; without a doubt, you will stand out when wearing Nishane Ani.

Bergamot and ginger prevents this from becoming too deep, while cardamom and black currant give it a juicy bite. \nIf you are a vanilla lover, this shouldn't be on your \"to-buy\" list; it should already be in your collection, with a crown placed on its head.

I smell the pine sap and the tree bark and a heavy dose of vanilla.  To me, it reminds me a bit of Angel without the challenging aspects of that fragrance.  Nothing sharp or abrasive here.  It\u2019s vanilla but with something woodsy and resinous yet also somehow green and fresh (probably because it reminds me of Douglas fir trees).  It\u2019s so unique and classy.  Very expensive so I had better save my pennies because I\u2019m in love and going to need more.", "19": "Ani is sinful goodness. It's spicy, green, warm, sweet, and velvety. \nI tested next to Room Service and these together \u2764\ufe0f A literal moan escaped under my breath. \nBoth are male-leaning to my nose.

It ripens up on your skin beautifully.", "22": "The hype is real real. You have to like truly unisex scents though because this is definitely not a traditional feminine scent and it's sweeter than a traditionally masculine perfume. The opening is very strong, citrusy and slightly bitter. I get pine needles, and freshly grated lemons. It's very invigorating. Then I get pickled ginger. I wouldn't recommend sniffing up close in the first 10 minutes because it is very sharp but bright and invigorating at the same time. As time passes you get a warmer, vanillic base that's slightly waxy but in an expensive/refined way. It softens but it never becomes just a Vanilla as it sits with something resinous. The dry down gives me whiffs of a better blended NY nights by Bond 9 or Black Phantom (Ani is more complex and pleasant to me). The longevity as a skin scent is great. I sprayed last night at 7pm and I could smell it on me without trying in the morning. This is gooorge.", "23": "I don't know why I waited so long to purchase this.

This is an outstandingly beautiful fragrance. Projection on this fragrance is absolutely marvelous from enormous for the first hour to heavy for a few hours following. This fragrance is all about that beautiful realistic vanilla note and it\u2019s other notes serve to highlight it. You get some spice from the ginger and a creamy woodiness from the sandalwood as well which are fairly prominent notes as well. But WOW. This fragrance truly has me amazed. Definitely a true unisex fragrance. I could see it working on a man or woman. I will be picking up a bottle in the future. Please sample this fragrance if you like vanilla based fragrances or are tired of the same old vanilla execution in fragrance. You will be happy you did! Masterpiece fragrance right here.", "25": "I saw this fragrance being mentioned everywhere on YouTube and since I love vanilla fragrances, I decided on buying a sample. I didn't think much of it. Until I tried it. I didn't know this is exactly what I needed and I've been looking for. Trying this scent was absolutely magical and so long lasting. It lasted well over 14 hours on my skin and it wasn't even a full spray. This beautiful, spicy and creamy vanilla is just to die for. As a gourmand and vanilla lover, this is just perfect.\n\nEDIT: opens very fresh, spicy and creamy. I get whiffs of spicy vanilla and a dessert-like vanilla. This pairs so well with Hacivat it\u2019s actually crazy", "26": "A must-have. I tend to be a bit weary of perfumes that go viral because they're sometimes overrated (I'm looking at you, Delina), but this one deserves all the praise it receives. Never in a million years would have I thought this beauty would smell the way it does by looking at the pyramid. There's something about this perfume that drives me crazy. The way the notes blend together is just... majestic. It's my third time wearing my sample and it's still a mystery to me. I don't think it resembles any perfume I've smelled before and I think it'll transform in its own beautiful way depending on who wears it. Another superb creation by Ms. Zarokian.\n(This is my first review on here btw :) hello beautiful community!)", "27": "It\u2019s way too much lemon in the opening. It has a nice buttery quality to it, comes through like a decadent pound cake. I don\u2019t understand the hype with this one. I think it would be better if the spice notes were more dominant. It\u2019s okay but there are much better gourmands out there. i\u2019m really not a fan of this lemon cake genre of gourmands - a la lira, ani, and unknown pleasures", "28": "This is a game changer. My sample arrived earlier today and oh damn the lemon cake sweetness to the scent smells delicious. I\u2019m also loving the dry down of this thing.

I will definitely be getting a 100ml bottle of Ani.", "29": "Such an interesting fragrance. The menthol opening is kind of off-putting, as some reviewers on here have mentioned. It is defo unisex, imo leaning male for the first hour due to the strong pink pepper bergamot flavour. Give it some time and it develops into this heady fruitchouli (black currant rose patchouli), which normally I don\u2019t care for, but it warms up the fragrance and also keeps developing. Give it more time and you will be left with an eternal warm resinous vanilla with a smokey incense backdrop. It\u2019s oriental. It\u2019s medieval. It\u2019s somehow novel, unusual and yet familiar.

I agree, the opening is a vanilla gourmand. You also get the citrus, cardamon and a whole lotta ginger\u2014 a nuclear cake bomb with massive synthetic overtones. I like it despite the obvious chemicals, but I didn\u2019t fall for Ani here. \n\nFor me, I got hooked during the remarkable drydown, when the scent takes a 180* turn and seems to last for hours, days even.\n\nSome people have compared the drydown to Nishane\u2019s big hit, Hacivat. If Hacivat smells like Ani, then I\u2019m going to love that one too. What I get is a more complex sandalwood-patchouli scent and, what I think must be the ambergris in the mix. It\u2019s kinda smoky and musky, like taking a walk through a heavily wooded Northern forest on a warm day. Vanilla and side kick ginger is still here, but respectably toned down. \n\nThe opening is masculine and the drydown is feminine. A little trashy, but still complex and smart. I don\u2019t watch YouTube videos so I didn\u2019t fall for any hype. I simply fell for Ani on the first date. By the third date, this Diva was in my collection.\n\nEdit 9-20-20\nThis does not remind me of Hacivat (a scent I dislike), but it does remind me of MFK Grand Soir.", "31": "This must be what heaven smells like...\n\nThe opening was unlike anything I've experienced before, and I really wanted it to last...the citrus and the spices dance really well together. Pretty soon though the vanilla came out to play; because this is such a concentrated fragrance, I was  worried about it being overpowering and for a split second I started to think it was getting too cloying. Thankfully though, the citrus stays a while and the spices/herby tang weave through to keep the gourmandy vanilla from going overboard. This fragrance is beautifully balanced - on me it definitely leans feminine, but not in a girly way. The cardamom, ginger, green notes, and cedar give a masculine touch to a warm and sublime vanilla. Both women and men could wear this, really. After about an hour of wear, I can't stop sniffing my arm!!! Send help\n\n(10/10 Exquisite)", "32": "This lived up to the hype for me.

Initially, I did not like it, I was of the feeling this was hyped unreasonably. But the more I'm wearing this, I'm starting to realise how well made a fragrance it really is. The ginger in this is the star, it keeps playing magic tricks on my skin, pushing and giving off whiffs hours after first applying, beautiful projection on this. The vanilla, benzoin mixed with the toned down pink pepper really stay a long time on skin. The sweetness in this is comforting, reminds me of Grand Soir sometimes, and ever so slightly Cedrat Boise in the dry down, while being different on its own. Ani is classy, elegant, and definitely draws people in with its scent bubble around you.\n\nOverall 8.5/10", "37": "Opens up with one of the most gorgeous vanilla notes I've ever smelt, along with ginger and citrus, and projects this way for about and hour and half. \n\nThe citrus dies off, but the ginger and the soft creamy sandalwood stays with the vanilla throughout the 8 hours of wear. \nIt's very gourmandy, and smells like a delicious vanilla sponge cake with hints of ginger and lemon rind in the sponge. \nRadiates off the skin for hours, and can be cloying if over-sprayed, so go easy on the application. \n\nCompletely unisex as well. I disagree with the \"too feminine\" remarks. It's sweet, but not femeninely sweet, rather just \"dessert\" sweet, and can be pulled off by anyone with a pleasant,cheerful and easy going personality\n\nMy wife is in love with this fragrance on me too, and couldn't keep her hands off me when I was wearing it. \nNishane have, in my opinion, made one of the best Vetiver fragrances (sultan vetiver), and now one of the best vanilla fragrances.", "38": "Nishane Ani is the first Niche fragrance that I bought for the vanilla scent and I was not let down by it. I will wear it for the special occasions at day or night during Winter/Spring or when it's raining outside. \n\nThe opening is spicy gourmand, which reminds me of lemon-ginger pie. But it is not overwhelming, it's fresh spicy and definitely cozy. It's somehow a little bit similar to the opening of Creed Aventus, which I think both of them are lovely at the first sniff.\n\nMiddle note still has the spiciness of cardamom but it blends beautifully with other scents. I cannot figure the black currant but it definitely exists. The middle note is quite unique and can be a irritating to some people, but I guarantee that it turns beautifully after this stage.\n\nThe dry down is sweet, powdery and delicious gourmand. It likes biting the Danisa cookies during holiday, then the warm vanilla lingers inside your nostrils. It's unisex and leans more feminine, but I think it works for both genders.\n\nWhat I love the most about Nishane Ani is its presentation of vanilla and the bottle's packaging: The box, the card and the heavy cap. I can immediately smell vanilla from the beginning until 10 hours later.\n\nThe performance is excellent with strong projection from 2-3 hours and it lasts for more than 10 hours on my skin and more than a week on my clothes. \n\n10/10", "39": "This is excellence - pure and simple.  Rich in quality and there is a lot going on with respect to how the notes transition and blend with the skin.  Unapologetic and unique that stops people and almost forces them to ask \"what are you wearing???!\" Vanilla, spice, musk, sandalwood and cedar - along with their own style of DNA bring this to pure joy.\n\nI have worn a few fragrances from Nishane, and this one earns first place.

It\u2019s a rich thick cream...super smooth vanilla infused with fresh ginger & cardamom.

Very dense...not airy at all.\n\nI agree the longevity is great, but I do spray heavily and unless I\u2019m moving I can\u2019t say there is a good projection.

This is my 3rd perfume from Nishane (I started with Wulong Cha and then Fan Your Flames, also sampled a few along the way), all I can say right now is Ani is my favorite from this incredible Turkish perfumery house. The nose behind Ani is C\u00e9cile Zarokian, who also composed one of Amouage\u2019s recently launched, Material and I heard so many good things about it too. \n\nIf you go through my collection, you could see that I have a thing for vanilla (well who doesn\u2019t?). But what grabbed my attention right from the beginning is the pink pepper and ginger combo. It\u2019s so interesting, so \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d vibe that makes you want it more. Then you started to pick up the black currant, beautiful Turkish rose, and cardamom which take your journey a little deeper but still keeping it on the bright side. On the dry down, it reminds me more of Musc Ravageur from Frederic Malle with the musk (of course), creamy sandalwood, benzoin, and very realistic/ aromatic vanilla. Nishane\u2019s crafts are certainly a top-notch/ world-class quality, you can tell that everything is well thought out. \nThis is another 10/10 for me, and if you're a gourmand lover, I think it will be a safe blind buy in case you couldn't have a chance to try it first. ;)", "47": "Guys I don\u2019t know why this one doesn\u2019t have rating over 4.5?!\nI received my sample today together with Hacivat so I first tried Hacivat and was like \u201cHm doesn\u2019t smell bad but not something special\u201d just a better version of Aventus. \nThen I immediately tested Ani and sheessh this stuff is gorgeous! It\u2019s not in your face but the sillage is unique and so delicious. When I got home I went to the kitchen but forgot to lock my car so went down and when I returned back my girl was sniffing like a dog and was wondering from where this precious smell is coming from and when she smelled me she was like a kid in a candy shop! Totally recommend this.", "48": "I went into testing Ani with scepticism. There's so much YouTube hype about this fragrance that I feel almost set up to dislike it simply due to expecting too much. \nAt first spray I was like, ok. It's ok. I started with it on a card and kept picking it up again to sniff. I liked it as it dried down, the warmth and sweetness were comforting but not cloying, and the ginger and vanilla combo worked well. I also liked that the ginger is a zingy fresh, green kind of ginger, I feel like it gives Ani some lightness to produce a more unique vanilla scent. \nI started testing it on skin and again, at first, I wasn't blown away. I liked it but didn't love it. The ginger softens in the dry down and the vanilla becomes more pronounced. I wasn't getting the massive beast that some people have said that Ani gives them, arms length sillage and about 4-6 hours wear only for me. But then something started happening. Over the ensuing days of testing, I fell in love with it. I craved it when I wasn't wearing it. It's winter here in Australia although it's not particularly cold where I live, and I found I craved the comfort of the vanilla in the evening and the freshness of the ginger on a 23\u00b0C sunny winter's day.

The bottle, the packaging, the name, the perfumer and most importantly the scent.\nThis bad boy and I, know each other for a very long time. \nI started wearing it as a young guy in late 90s.\nWe have been together in good and in bad.\nI remember the ladies reactions when they would smell this... They would go crazy.\nCompliment after Compliment wherever i would go.\nI was wearing Le Male religiously everyday and every night... Then came year 2006 and i met my second fragrance love. It was YSL L'homme edt. I started wearing L'homme and when i emptied last drops of Le Male i didnt rebuy again. Probably i got tired of it after wearing it every Day for more then 6 years. I was, and im still wearing YSL L'homme, but couple days ago i found an empty bottle of Le Male in my basement, i removed the stopper and tried to see does it have some juice left inside. I managed to squize half spray if that, and let me tell you... I fell in love again. Yesterday i had to buy it again. New bottle. It is the same scent like it was 23 years ago when i first smelled it. I have to say that it is not as strong and long lasting like before but hey neighter i am. Lol\nI got appriciation for discrete scents with Ysl l'homme and Le Male is still double the power compared to ysl. \nIt still lasts decent amount of time from 7-10h, and it projects 3-5 foot i would say. Enough for me. I tried Le Parfum but it is just terribly sweet and unbalanced. Smells like everything sweet designers put out today without concept and without soul. Im gonna pass that one and stick to my old love one and only Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male... Cheers...", "2": "I don't get when people say \"everybody is wearing it, so this is bad, so I don't like it, bla bla bla...\".\nWhen a designer create a fragrance, he expects that fragrance become POPULAR and SELL.\nI really don't care how many people are wearing it.\nIf you want something \"exclusive\", go to a very obscure niche brand. \nLe Male is AMAZING.

This is a lady killer and surely I can tell being one of them. \nThe opening is minty fresh and spicy with bergamot and lavender tones. The drydown brings vanilla and cinnamon to front. I believe that this scent has the best blended in cinnamon I have smelled - it's subtle, sweet and yet a little bit piquant. \nThe scent is warm, sweet, cozy, masculine, very sexy and has some serious depth to it. A piece of art, really. \nIt's so popular for a reason. Gentlemen, don't stay away from frangrances only because they are too known - you might end up missing a lot, so might the ladies. \nTo me 8,5/10.", "5": "This is the dogs bollocks. If you go on a night out n you want to pull, this is the fragrance for you. It has never failed me... The ultimate weapon in your attraction arsenal", "6": "I had the original first batch of this perfume when it came out in 1995. But I think I got my bottle by spring 1996. \nI was 20 and a fashion student. Loved the denim brand Junior Gaultier which was very popular at the time. \nThrough my school I made an internship at the JPG head office at that time located at 30 Rue du Faubourg Saint\u2013Antoine. The entire building belonged to the company and on the ground floor was a store. Gaultier was at his peak and one of the hottest names in the fashion industry. I was totally starstruck. \nThe interior of the office was very industrial, raw iron painted in dark green and partly rusty. The entrence to the office was automatically sprayed with Le Male so it was the first thing you noticed when arriving and last thing when leaving. The JPG fashion shows were always very spectacular and the evening news in France would show clips from the show. Everybody who was somebody would be there :) Madonna would walk as a model. Bare chested with a baby stroller with a white poodle dog in it :)\nNeedless to say i was in seventh heaven. So I guess I\u2018m entitled to say I have a very special connection to this scent. \nI was using Le Male for approx 3 years but then got tired of it. It became extremly popular and at one point perhaps with a crowd that did not know anything about the brand Gaultier. \n\nFor 20 years I had a love hate relation to this scent. Not once did I test it. I guess it reminded me too much of past times. \n\nBut today..... I just got a feeling and bought a 40 ml bottle. \nOMG..... Memory flashback. I have been missing this scent so much. It was amazing back in 1995 and it\u2018s still amazing in 2019. \n\nFor me, what is dominant here is lavender and mint. Some vanilla and neroli flower. There is just so much going on here. \nIt is a masterpiece and trully unique. No wonder this has been one of the best sold scents for almost 25 years. \n\nSo people talk about re\u2013formulations and different batches. Trust me, there is nothing re\u2013formulated here. It is still exactly the same and super strong. 1\u20132 sprays is enough. I was a bit too eager today and sprayed 5 times. That was 4 hours ago and i stink :) \nI love it and so happy I found it again. Or perhaps did it find me. \nWill keep a bottle in my collection from now on.\n\nUpdate after Wearing for 1 full day;\nOk.... it has been diluted slightly. With 2 sprays it still lasts a good 10 hours.  Back in the days it would last for ever. Now it is toned down a bit. Which honestly is not a bad thing. I think this was one of reasons I stopped using it at a point, it was too heavy.\nThe scent is still exactly the same, only a bit less heavy and more wearable.", "7": "It's obvious this is a hate or love fragrance. No matter which side you're on this stuff changed fragrances. Even though it became mainstream to everyone the smell was so unique and amazing.\n\nI loved Le Male. It was truly a masterpiece to me.\n\nNow it's completely ruined. The stuff you buy these days is not the Le Male there used to be. I know seasons change along with ingredients and regulations, but it does not justify the harm of an reformulation that was done to this former piece of art.\n\nProjection and longevity used to be enormous (I know some people hated it and found it cloying) but it was also what gave Le Male its charm. It was a powerful fragrance in every way. It was bold, loud and in your face - still amazing smelling.\n\nNow it's just a shadow of itself, weak and boring. I really think that the reformulation they did is a sin to creativity and a lack of respect for the art of perfume and to their own brand. \n\nLe Male - R.I.P.", "8": "To start this review, I wouldn't say that this is a cologne that every men should know, but HAVE. Even 1 bottle, at least once in their lives.\n\nLe Male is an oriental foug\u00e8re fragrance. For those who do not know, foug\u00e8res have as predominant notes, combinations of lavender, bergamot, geranium, oakmoss, coumarin and amber. It is not necessary to have all these notes for a fragrance to be considered a foug\u00e8re; but bergamot, oakmoss and lavender are virtually essential for a good foug\u00e8re. The oriental part is on behalf of notes like vanilla, cinnamon and sandalwood.\n\nLe Male is an intense, sensitive and masculine scent and, at the same time, modern and sexy. I'd even say cozy! In my humble opinion, Le Male is not a cologne for teens, even those who want to look 10 years older, just to impress the girls. The target audience for this fragrance are men over 25 years old.\nI consider it ideal for night time, also could be worn in a ballad - in order to make it clear that the man who wears it wants to mark his territory - or in a nice romantic date. On the other hand, I don't think it\u2019s good for hot days, because the aroma doesn't match and the effect can be devastating, as it is a sweet, dry and strong fragrance.\n\nThe evolution of this scent, at least on my skin, it's not the greatest, because I think it's quite linear from the start to the end. However, the trail and its durability on the skin are unique characteristics, which put it at the top of the perfumery world. I can guarantee, easily, between 8 to 12 hours of lasting!\nFor those who don't know its aroma, there are some similar colognes on the market that, changing a little bit here and there, tried to imitate this classic fragrance, which is a big seller in the world, until nowadays. They are: Cuba Gold, 212 Sexy, Romero Britto, Jacomo Rouge, etc.\n\nNow, after all that has been said, are you curious or not to go to the first perfume store and try this gem?", "9": "THE CHANEL NUMBER 5 FOR MEN.\n\nThis is one of the most iconic and understated fragrances on the market now.  Firstly, this is not designed to appeal the masses and must be worn in the right setting.  I think that this fragrance gets a bad reputation because people don\u2019t know how to wear this.  This is definitely not a fragrance that will say \u201ci\u2019m Here, look at me\u201d instead will say \u201ccome explore me\u201d it\u2019s sophisticated, sensual, and sexy. \n\nI cant stress this enough.  You must wear this right.  Three sprays, and your sillage will leave this exotic and appealing trail.  This is one of the only fragrances where the top notes last and last, but marry with sweet and airomatic base notes.  You\u2019ll get that barbershop freshness in the morning, woody and fresh in the afternoon and spicy and exotic in the evening.  This is like the einigerzier bunny- it just keeps going.  \n\nWho says this is a club scent,  i\u2019ve Worn this in the office, to dinner, to a bonfire-it is one of my most complimented, when worn right.", "10": "Sexy, Romantic, Passionate, Sensual. Words cannot express the things that come in this bottle. Ive smelled many many fragrances throughout my time. Ive smelled the other popular designer night time/sexy/romantic scents like A*Men, Pure Malt, Armani Code, La Nuit de L'homme, Allure, many many more. Ive smelled the popular niche fragrances in the class such as Musc Ravageur, Tobacco Vanille, New Haarlem, Chergui, and many manny more. But for me, nothing matches up to Jean Paul Gaultier's Le male. For me, its the greatest fragrance in the world. \n\nFirst of all, the scent itself. From the amazing Mint and Lavender opening, to the absolutely hypnotizing Vanilla middle and drydown, this fragrance is absolute sex in a bottle, an absolute lady killer, and must be by far the most complimented fragrance of all time. \n\nSecondly, many fragrances can smell good, but do they last? and can someone smell me from over there...With Le Male, there is never any worry about that. It projects like a beast and lasts long. That power, coupled with the hypnotizing scent, makes for an absolute gem. \n\nThird. Yeah. Its popular. Its one of the best sellers in the history of the the industry and for damn good reason. Just because it sells alot doesnt mean it should be looked down on. If it wasnt so amazing, it wouldnt be so popular. Its as simple as that. Its overall financial success in the fragrance industry shouldnt be something that you fault this fragrance for, but something that should be recognized and rewarded. \n\nIve been very very very pleased with alot of fragrances, but there is no fragrance in this world that has left the impression that Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier has left me. When i smelled it on a friend for the first time, i was absolutely shocked. SHOCKED. \n\nThis IS the greatest fragrance of all time, and it shouldnt be knocked because so many of tried copying it and it shouldnt be knocked because it doesnt smell funky or like a womens perfume. \n\nBasketball has Michael Jordan.

If you go by the reviews here, it feels like you're getting plain water and some scent with this. Complete BS. It still a performer, it still smells damn good, and considering the \"bubblegum\" trend we have today, it's kinda funny to think this was considered outrageously sweet for a masculine fragrance back in the day.\n\nStill deserving the praise of being one of the most iconic work of perfumery ever made.", "13": "I still have a original 1995 JPG Le Male which is very strong,nice and smooth although the current version is not as quite as strong its still seems very popular with women even though some so called expert frag heads think its outdated they must have their head in the clouds lol", "14": "I love this scent - its heavy and sexy and really lasts - my partners clothes still carry this days after (hes dumped them on the floor!) hes worn them.

It's unnecesary to make another detailed review on this ode on how to make successfull marketing, but I will say some things that may help when you're in the dilemma of \"which is better, Le male or...?\".\n1-Le Male is too common to use it to surprise somebody (lack of uniqueness)\n2-Le Male definitely kills every single new frag in the market in terms of sillage, staying power, etc\n3- Le Male is the epithome of (synthetic)vanilla-based perfumes. If you like industrially manufactured vanilla (that is to say, aromatic candle smell), you will like this. Personally, i love it\n4-Le Male wins in the versatility realm, but NEVER use it in hot summer days or people will hate you.\n5-Very expensive, BTW\n6- Women really like this, I don't know why.

Projection was tremendous with just two sprays, longevity fantastic at 12-14 hours in the moderate cold.  It was exciting and could still be subtle if you played it conservative on sprays.  JPG's management must have figured out people weren't buying enough refills of the juice for their liking, it was lasting too long and cutting into their exaggerated profit estimates.  A 4.2 oz could literally last years.  You could get away with one to two sprays per wear and get excellent performance from this Kurkdijan modern masterpiece without causing much of a fuss from the general public around you.  Now you need 7-8 sprays just to get moderate projection and longevity of around 5-6 hours and even then it's neither as dynamic or as dirty and sweaty as previous editions.  This is completely watered down stuff, luckily I have a vintage bottle still, but my recent purchase from mid 2012 always seems to let me down, reminding me of corporate gluttony, greed and its ever expanding and pervasive reach on the global economy.  France was one of the last resisters of that brand of corporate greed, but since Sarkozy and the move towards the EU under German capital has greatly UK/Americanized and become one of the greatest advocates of corporate consolidation and merging.

I love smelling this on men but go light on the trigger because it can be a bit cloying. Monster sillage and longevity. This fragrance is confident and alluring.", "25": "Le Male was one of those that I'd never gotten around to wearing because (a) it'd been so ubiquitous, and (b) I liked it on paper, but didn't really love it, and I had plenty of other sweet scents that did it for me.\n\nI finally saw a deal for a large tester and pulled the trigger, not even with any big plans on wearing it, possibly even just to hold on to in case the formula got too much more touched up.\n\nWell I finally put it on over this past weekend and it was a 100% revelation. Do I have a lot of other sweet scents? Yes - do I have a lot of vanilla scents? Yes.\n\nWhat stood out for me was the way the mint becomes SOOOO much more noticeable when I wear this. For whatever reason, on paper it never stood out. I guess maybe I never kept a strip around long enough, since the evolution seems to take so much longer that way (if it ever happens). Eros should be very similar but they are amazingly different from one another - I am legitimately floored by how different these two vanilla-mint blends are. Side by side, outside of their primary vanilla/mint accords, Eros is noticeable woodier and greener while this is decidedly floral.\n\nWhether this is the case for everyone, or it was just a quirk of my personal chemistry, this was INCREDIBLE after it dried down on me. That minty-vanilla lavender accord, however elusive when I'd smelled it before was just perfect on my own skin. I literally could not stop smelling my hand where I'd put it on.\n\nForgive me Jean Paul, I have smelled the light - this stuff is magic.", "26": "I just got this 2 days ago (19th June 2014) and I can say that it still has a very good performance. Smells like smooth, minty vanilla talcum powder. I think anyone can wear this since well....everyone wears talcum powder. It's just a nice scent that everyone can wear. Might smell like mouthwash at first but after about 5 minutes you'll notice the vanilla and it'll just smell like very cooling vanilla talcum powder. I don't think this is synthetic at all though. I sprayed once on my chest and once on my neck at 9pm at night. It was still clearly there by 5am and was still projecting that I could smell it without trouble. Easily lasts 10+ hours. It projects at about an arm's length after 5 hours. It can project  up to 5 meters before 5 hours though. Might not seem to project at all for some people because the type of scent Le Male has is pretty 'transparent' and people won't really notice it unless they're idle so that they'll actually notice that there's a scent going about in the air. I think this can easily overwhelm your sense of smell even though it's transparent because I tried to spray it on my suit and I couldn't smell it at all. But then I tried hanging it on my chair and backed away to a good 4 to 5 meters and I could smell it easily. It's still strong, so pre-reformulation's performance is probably not much different than this one. I'd guess that the scent has become more transparent than before and that the longevity might have been reduced, even though it's still currently beast mode, just doesn't seem so unless you really pay attention to it. 3 sprays maximum!! Any more and it'll smell weird :) It's transparent but yes, it does indeed project. Lasts days on clothes, but spray it on your skin because it won't really project much if you spray it on clothes.\n\nUpdate (22 June 2014):\nIt is now hour 12 since I've sprayed this on myself. I thought nothing of it until now, because it was gone. I turned on my stove to heat my kettle. Was making some coffee. My body heated up a little and to my surprise, actually revived Le Male. Simply loving this baby :)\n\nCheers.", "27": "So, Le Male. Where do I start? I absolutely love this fragrance. At the opening, you are greeted with a beautiful lavender, and additionally a bit of freshness from the mint. Disclaimer: It only gets better. The dry down is one of the best I have ever smelt. An extremely strong wave of vanilla is introduced in the dry down, with a hint of cinnamon and amber too. If you love vanilla, this is the one for you. Sweet and sexy, perfect for the winter I would say. This is also quite versatile in terms of age and situations you would wear it in. My only issue I have seen to encounter is the performance. I picked up another bottle in August this year, and it just does not seem to project or last longer than 5/6 hours. I would have to spray 7/8 times to even get noticed in an arm\u2019s length. Because of this, this fragrance may be more of a date night fragrance nowadays  as there is a much more intimate sense to the sillage instead of something loud and noticeable. Nevertheless, this is obviously a classic and is definitely worth a try, and if you enjoy sweetness, this is a no-brainer of a blind buy. Decent price and performance, beautiful scent.", "28": "From the first spray to the last hint of it on your skin, you will love this fragrance. My god i was lost for words when i first sprayed this on my skin. The aromatic and vanilla accords over power the room and any women within a 10 meter radius of you will turn their heads and think: \" Lets get it on\".", "29": "Got my first bottle ever yesterday, never smelled it before and I have to say that it smells really good.\n\nLast really long too, did a couple of sprays this morning, almost 9 hours later and I still get a whiff of the smell now and then, so definitely long lasting.\n\nSmells very fresh with a sensual touch, might be my new favorite so far. Still a noob in fragrances though, so that might not say much.", "30": "I can swear that from the 100+ bottles I own this scent does something to women that I can't understand at all! It's like a magic potion that makes them horny when they smell you.Every female person I know loves this! It's unique, sexy, alluring, and the new 2020 bottles have great longevity. I am on my second 200ml bottle, that's how great it is!", "31": "I know everybody think this is weak as hell, me included, but I'm gonna tell you guys a funny anecdote: I worked as a nurse a year ago and I wasn't supposed to wear any fragrance to work... Well I did anyways and mostly wore this, max two sprays under my shirt, on my chest... There was one time I sprayed this at 5:00AM before work and my colleague who came into her shift at 14:00PM said as soon as she entered the nurse room: 'Who smells like Le Male in here?!' lol.\n\nBtw, my batch code is a 2019 one.", "32": "Never wore Le Male in the 90s, but ALOT of my friends did. Remember smelling it everywhere and decided early on not to jump on the train. Now almost 25 years later I got me a small 40ml. Smells really nic. Strong opening with a somewhat more pronounced green note than I remember. Still good performance and the dry down is really cozy. Dont view this as overly sweet at all. 2020 batch made in Spain.", "33": "The synthetic but beautiful blast of artemesia, mint, lavender, orange blossom and cardamom for the first ten minutes of the duration is what keeps me coming back, before the vanilla and cinnamon fully take hold.  A landmark fragrance that lives up to the flashy and confrontational bottle design, that is far more overtly political than you would have guessed, looking back on matters from today's vantage point with broader perspective.  Gaultier was challenging the very concept of how masculinity was perceived and Kurkdijan followed suit, giving us a vanilla, tonka, lavender, mint and amber bomb that's evolution was multi-tiered and worth the ride, if your significant other could stand its powdery essence.  For that reason, do realize this is extremely polarizing juice and is best used in subtle ways.  Used to wear this fragrance when I had to fly from Frankfurt to Beijing (ca.10 hrs) because I knew it would cover me the whole way and then some.  Later reformulations have reduced performance but the essence of the scent is still there, especially the top and mid levels that give Le Male its flair that many imitations and clones can't fully capture.", "34": "A fabulous creation for a fashion house that proved a formal education and background in fashion was not necessary to be accepted into the Parisian fashion elite.  Jean Paul Gaultier endured a great deal of class chastisement on his ascent to fame in couture haut Paris for his tendency to lean heavily on shock value and marketing rather than substance.  Gaultier worked his way up through a quick and voracious consumption of his influences, borrowing fantastically from a wide array of ideas and molding them into his own unique and profound vision that in its earliest days had a very timely and unique vision.  \nLe Male and the female equivalent that preceded it, Classique were personifications of his vision when Gaultier was still at the top of his game and showed initiative for creativity beyond simply supporting his cash cows with endless flankers lacking sincere desire to push any envelopes.  The elements ultimately came together perfectly in Le Male, revitalizing the French fashion elite with a fresh dose of working-class ideas and new blood looking to democratize and expand the clientele base beyond just the higher income target audience.  \nJean Paul Gaultier ultimately succeeded because it made clear a new direction in French fashion houses that had already been done in the USA and UK, targeting a broader base beyond the elite and upper middle-class, searching to bring in the middle and lower middle class, a market rarely given such attention in France before the 1990's.\nLe Male is his one shining moment in the realm of masculine fragrances; owing a great deal to its packaging ingenuity.  Heavily influenced by the commercial art of Andy Warhol, Gaultier chose to package his male torso in a tin can, a not so subtle tribute to Warhol's famous Campbell's Soup tin labels.\nThe juice itself is striking in its uniqueness at the time of release.  Signing up Francis Kurkdijan was a stroke of brilliance and Kurkdijan did not let him down on either of his fist two groundbreaking releases for Gaultier; Classique et Le Male.\nLe Male daringly attempts to balance vanilla, lavender, cinnamon, mint, amber and cardamom into a fragrance that doesn't smell overcrowded or overly ambitious and does it with a tremendous technical skill.  Kurkdijan manages to find a striking balance throughout, never allowing the rather synthetic notes to come together as such, instead emitting a certain subdued loudness that is both daring and yet also somewhat reserved.  The loudness and brashness of Le Male is more implied in the packaging than the juice, which is actually a powerhouse indebted greatly to the 1980's.  \nA blast of lavender, bergamot, cardamom, mint and artemisia kicks off Le Male and is actually quite subtle and well balanced.  There is none of the shock and bravado implied by some of the reviewers.  This is far more standard and technically balanced than most people would like to give it credit for.  \nAround the five minute mark the cinnamon starts to assert itself but is never overpowering.  The orange blossom and caraway are both evident, but more to take a bit of the weight away from the strong natural tendencies of the cinnamon to dominate.  Kurkdijan manages to find a tremendous balance, paving the way for the vanilla to find accord with cinnamon and lavender and dirtied up just enough by the cardamom and amber to give the impression of being somewhat natural despite the heavy synthetic implications of Le Male.  \nMasterfully constructed, a truly magnificent creation that is wonderful in fall, winter and spring and though not refined in the classic sense, has already achieved modern classic stature and has become rather timeless because of its well balanced nature and lack of floral pomp.  This is neither overtly masculine nor feminine leaning, it achieves a wonderful universality so rarely accomplished in fragrance.  \nLongevity is outstanding, 10-12 hours is standard and 18 hours in colder weather is not unheard of.  Projection is tremendous well into the seventh hour before things start to recede a bit, but Le Male manages to hang on to the skin better than most scents.  \nBecomes loud when the vanilla merges with the top and middle and this is what many object to, as the vanilla is certainly synthetic.  Yet despite this it still manages to be very far from cloying in any respect.  \nIf you are looking for a dirtier and more ambery version of this on a budget, I would suggest Cubano Gold by Victory International as an accompanying scent when you would prefer to best enjoy your Le Male in moderation, with a bit of variety but the same basic essence.  \nOverrated?  Shockingly no.  Despite its tremendous success, this is a wonderful commercial product that managed to find the perfect balance between packaging, marketing, quality and bravado.", "35": "3.69 is a travesty\nif push came to shove this is a 4.4, it's awesome!\nIt's so great everyone around the world loves it and it's  still a top seller after 20 years.\nHow can you argue with this.\nI have 200 bottles, and this will be the first one out of the 200 that will need to be replaced, LOL, it's 45% full...I use it more often I guess?! means it's good folks .", "36": "I got this for my partner i find it so sexy when i smell it on him he never wears cologne or any male perfume.

They know we're hooked and keep buying so they dont care if they cheapen it.\n\nBut a new fragrance, like a new person to date, they'll suddenly bring out the best. And it'll last for days and can be noticed for miles around.\n\nSad, but I've found this to be all too true in almost every industry; technology, food items, clothing brands, entertainment (looking at you Disney & Star Wars) and of course, fragrances.\nThen the YT reviewers put the rarities & vintage versions on blast, then suddenly their price on eBay goes up 5x.\nWe may have to go back to the old ways of just asking the lady at the Macy's counter, \"Whats the newest ones?\" and picking out a fav, and buying 2 large bottles and calling it a day.\n\nps.

If I keep it to one or two sprays, though, Le Male can deliver exactly what I want from its note pyramid, which is that of a casual but beautiful barbershop scent, wafting of sweet vanilla, creamy lavender, refreshing mint, and nutty tonka.\n\nI would describe Le Male as a couple octaves less sweet than Versace Eros, which is a good thing in my opinion. That said, if you still find Le Male too sweet or playful, you might consider Prada L'homme or Valentino Uomo Intense, both of which are more spicy, soapy, and floral than Le Male, but less sweet and cloying (especially Valentino). You might also try one of my personal favorite sleepers (drumroll.....), Versace The Dreamer, which uses Iris and florals like Prada and Valentino but adds tobacco leaf to the base for a dryer, more dynamic fragrance journey.\n\nAs always, try before you buy and happy (scent) trails to you all.", "41": "Clean laundry with vanilla.

Fun Fact: not everyone knows that this fragrance was based on a men\u2019s hairdresser in the 50's (As per Francis Kurkdjian)\nLike what I said they are doing the reformulation just because they still wants to fit in.\nI have no problem at all. I still love the scent profile. and it's still performs well.", "46": "In 1995 my life was taking dramatic direction, in my mind Polo Green was still the best fragrance available, but like many in their early twenties, I had no money to drop on a fragrance so I tended to use basic aftershave splashes and some AVON items I had been gifted.  I know I smelt this scent as the 90\u2019s would progress, it was the opposite of pretty much any scent I had been exposed to.  I would see the bottle in the homes of people I knew or encountered, didn\u2019t know much about it, often saw the tin it came in also on display, but what I did know was that the people wearing it then were just not my type of people.  These people had cell phones, so they could make calls in strange places and indicate they were on a cell phone, they wore the current trend in clothes and would do everything in their power to block a friend that was in conversation with a girl in whatever night club the group went to.  This scent was attached to the arsenal of being a player in a constantly changing world, and the people wearing it then had a bravado that I just did not have, and often did not appreciate.  It belonged to people I felt were juvenile, where I was often focused more on what the hell life was even about?  I myself was becoming independent and travelling the country, meeting new people and making new friends along the way.  As I have stated before, and many know, scent memory is a powerful thing.  Le Malle locks in memories of my youth and that sense of not fitting in\u2026If only I could travel back and let that guy know things would be ok, folks it will all be ok, enjoy every moment you have on this earth.\n\n    Now I appreciate this scent, as the true game changer it was.  Refined enough to surpass Joop, and leading mens fragrance in a new direction.  Even reformulated this scent is strong, and I enjoy wearing it, but like Polo Green it tends to date the wearer and is just not quite right for today.  Not because it is bad, so much as it has just had its day and now is more about nostalgia for those who recall it\u2019s peak run.\n\n     Really, how can one review a fragrance of this nature?", "47": "Lasts forever and smells great.

Thankfully, the cherry isn't obnoxious, but it provides a tart/sweet foil to the masculine leather/incense. Combine that with smooth almond/tonka and a hint of florals...Ideal perfume indeed!

I loved the original EDT and if you do too, then you will also LOVE the EDP!  \nWhere the EDT had cherry, almond, and leather notes, in the EDP, the almond note combines with lots of vanilla, the cherry note becomes mandarin, and the leather note becomes suede. \nLongevity: 8+ hours\nSillage: Moderate within the first hour.

It has cherries, absolutely. It has a special creamy nutty, vanilla tone as well which rounds out the cherries beautifully.  \nHowever, the one thing my wife and I disagreed on is that I pick up on a smoke note and she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a cigarette-like smoke. A fresh lit, freshly puffed cigarette smoke. It\u2019s absolutely stunning. It sounds gross, but it is so impressive and tremendous. It blends harmoniously with the cherries, almonds and vanilla. It adds a masculine touch. \nThis stuff is amazing. I really hope I\u2019m not the only one that picks up on the smoke note! \nOVERALL: \n- Scent - 9/10. This stuff isn\u2019t the highest quality, but holy cow is this gorgeous.

Why am I saying this? Because in the past I've said that male perfumes started to be very boring and linear. You either like one or not, so simple. \nWhat happens here? The BEST male perfume ever smelled. I mean it even beats Chanel's classics, should I say YSL's La nuit de l'homme too? Yes, why not? It's sexy, it's bold, it's masculine, well blended, complex, as 'sweet' as a gentelman should be, sporty and dressy at the same time, you want me to tell more? I can't yet call it unique but this perfume can be easily not only a signature scent, but also a great gift. No men in the world will dislike it, don't ask me about women. It's a seducer. \nDon't worry about cherry or almond note, it's more of a combination that brings a dry marascino liquor effect. This is it's uniqueness if we could say. Vanilla and tonka bean are so light, as much as needed for a male perfume to warm it and empower the 'cherry' note. In general, it belongs to spicy/aromatic family, I can smell almost all of it's notes listed above but spices are rocking hard. In a few words, spices, incense, green herbs, the right sweet (not gourmandise at all) touch, sandalwood, maybe leather is missing or it's very soft. OK, nobody is perfect so the only minus? It can't be versatile! I know we can wear what we like, there are no genders in perfumes or right ages but this is a 30+ one, winter-fall. Maybe summer will make it kind of generic or overwelming.

Just beautiful. The almond, leather, vanilla, cherry.... this stuff just smells fantastic!", "16": "Oh my god this smells ridiculously delicious to me. Cherry-almond-tonka-vanilla woody fragrance that is just perfect for fall & winter. \n\nThe incense is a nice touch with the leather/woods that adds a slightly smoked character to this scent. I know this is masculine but to me it's perfectly unisex. \n\nI absolutely HATE super leathery, citrusy, or oudy male perfumes...basically run the other direction! However THIS is JUST DAMN IRRESISTIBLE.\n\nThe lasting powder is great, as is the sillage. I need it, I want it.", "17": "Wore this to work yesterday and it lasted me the whole time I was around my co-workers (after 6 pm im 1 of 2 people left). I work 2nd shift in a warehouse so a fragrance that lasts at least 5 hrs is good enough for me. Cherry and almond is a lovely combo. I wear fragrances for ME only, I like getting whiffs of my \"scent of the day\" as Im moving about but I also don't want to offend anybody. If I get compliments all the more better. This is definately a safe unisex scent. Very pleased with this purchase.", "18": "First comes a strong blast of balsamic musk, with fresh bergamot peels and ground spices. After a few minutes it becomes more sexy, lingering for a long time with both cherries, vanilla, and sweet almonds. This sweetness continues all the way through the longevity, which for me is about 8-9 hours. The leather and woody notes sit close to skin, making it very delicious and sultry.\nI bought this for my boyfriend, but I must admit I do enjoy spraying it on myself from time to time, it definitely has a unisex quality. A truly remarkable blend of nutty, sweet, woody and balsamic goodness.", "19": "maaaan !!!! i haven\u00b4t expected anything different from original edt (which i\u00b4ve had for 2 years) .... \n\nit\u00b4s miles away from the original edt version.

Elegant but not standoffish. Good longevity. Fair sillage. Another good offering by Guerlain.", "24": "This is beautifully made, (just as the EDT). The difference between both: one is based on almond, the other one is based on cherry. Both are worth buying in my taste. The EDP is more sensual, mysterious, and seductive. EDT is more manly and elegant. EDP last long! I applied it very early in the morning, and 5 pm I could still easily feel it lingering around. It is a different smell to me, even thought it has reminded me a little bit of Fahrenheit parfum and Bvlgari man in black. I am very happy with this purchase.", "25": "Interesting fragrance, and not quite what I was expecting.  I saw the notes and was expecting a sweeter scent profile. This is very dry with some subtle vanilla sweetness in the background. \n\nThe almond note is prominent. There cherry is present but subtle. I was concerned that this might smell like cherry cough syrup, but it doesn\u2019t.  It\u2019s just the right amount of cherry. Within about 5 minutes a powdery note starts to develop.  I agree 100% with HullHockey91, there is a very noticeable cigarette smoke note in this fragrance. Maybe that\u2019s the leather and/or the incense.  \n\nIt\u2019s a nice sophisticated scent. Very masculine and mature.  Best suited for a guy over the age of 30.   This would work well in an office setting or a formal setting.  Its projection is light.  This is most appropriate for cooler weather.  \n\nI have a sample and I\u2019ll see if this grows on me. I like but don\u2019t love it.  Right now I\u2019m leaning against buying a full bottle.  It is well blended and high quality, but here are a lot of scents out there that I like better. I\u2019d rate it 7.5/10.\n\n******** UPDATE ***********\n\nAfter wearing this a few times I\u2019ve upgraded my rating from like to love.  This is a great office scent.  It\u2019s interesting and different from most scents that are out there.  I have come to better appreciate the dry note of almond after a few wearings.  I\u2019m going to now give this 8.5/10.  I\u2019m not in an immediate rush to grab a bottle, but I\u2019m thinking later this year it\u2019s going to end up on my shelf.", "26": "They should have called it 'La Petite Leather Jacket Noire'.\n\nLa Petite Robe Noire toughened up and has gone rogue wearing a super cool leather jacket.\n\nIt is simply gorgeous, for a man or woman.", "27": "An amazing boozy fragrance. This reminds me of frapin speakeasy. its so elegant and soft. Not strong and harsh and a bit of feminine side but its ok. Perfect for colder months and evening. This can be a signature scent. The almond cherry combine with vanilla are fantastic. Also remind me of cherry coke added vanilla. An amazing with great performance. I got about 6 to 8 hours of performance. Solid projection.  This could easily be in niche type of fragrance.  Nice job guerlain.", "28": "Fantastic Autumn/Winter scent.\n\nI've owned both the original EDT and Cologne versions. I liked but didn't love either of them as I found they got a bit cloying after wearing for a few hours.\n\nThis version tones down the almond note and introduces a fantastic cherry note that makes this fragrance just feel more resolved and better blended imho.\n\nEasily the best of the line of the ones i've tried and a fantastic cooler weather, evening scent for a reasonable price.\n\nAnother Guerlain Gem!", "29": "When you go to grab your jacket and you get a whiff of that cherry, vanilla goodness lingering from days ago. 10/10 fragrance.", "30": "Sexy leather jacket in a forest full of cherry. It's a very unique scent. Kinda reminds me of the opening of Paco Rabanne 1 Million Prive because of the strong cherry vibe, but after 30 minutes both fragrances part their ways. Awesome pick for fall and winter, you will definitely stand out with that, and in a positive way only.", "31": "I like the original L'Homme Id\u00e9al but as nice as it is, it's just missing that \"thing\" that'd make it great to me! Luckily this EDP version most certainly turns it into a big love!\n\nIt's the very best designer/cheaper niche use of the \"flavor of the week\" note: Tonka bean.\n\nLightly spicy and a bit incense-y dark brown vanilla extract, which is also a bit oud-ish, on an amazing cherry (The tonka bean) and the original's bittersweet almond, with leather amped up from the EDT, sandalwood I get also and of course the legendary suave Guerlinade in the background!\n\nIt kind of feels like what YSL's now cult M7 would have smelled like if it was created by Guerlain. Or I'd say to me a better, while that part is a matter of taste obviously, Dior Homme Parfum (With some F\u00e8ve D\u00e9licieuse added) and they could certainly appeal to the same customers. Very similar bases but with L'Homme Id\u00e9al using cherry and almond instead of iris. This is Thierry Wasser creating fragrances more for the younger, current trends without sacrificing an iota of the company's quality or their style.\n\nIn my opinion this is by a landslide the 2016 release of the year on the men's side.", "32": "I really like this one. The cherry is strong in the first hour, with good projection. After that, it sits pretty close to the skin, which is unfortunate, because that's when I like it best. The cherry settles a bit and the incense really comes out. Reminds me of M7 Oud Absolu at the very end. Not identical, just reminiscent.", "33": "Lasts all day. Smells so good. UNBELIEVABLE. A cherry/almond fizzy vanilla with leathery tonka bean undertones.\n\nLongevity: 10/10\nSillage: 9/10\nScent: 10/10\nProjection: 9/10\nComplements: 10/10\n\nUPDATE (first-wearing): Went to the grocery store before work. I apologized jokingly to the 60-something dude in line behind me for going so slow bagging my fare. He said, \"take your time, you smell really good.\" He wasn't flirting. Just a sincerely enjoyed GLIEDP. Got to work, and my friendly female nose at work thinks this is REALLY NICE. Personally, smelling myself all day was one of the most enjoyable of fragrance journeys. Applied before 7am...at 4PM (9 hours?) there was still a scent trail sillage and an arm-length projection.\n\nThe evolution of the scents was also non-linear. It starts with a fizzy cherry soda that isn't too strong, but carries with it some lavender, incense, sandalwood and a hint of rose. Throughout the journey, almond and vanilla provide body for the tonka sweetness without too much powederiness. As the drydown develops, the fragrance becomes cherry-vanilla with almondy-tonka. What is the most amazing, though, is the leather that appears from the first spray until the last whiff 14 hours later. It's a sweet, clean leather that leans this fragrance to the masculine side of the spectrum. \n\nDefinitely found my leather cologne. I also found my almond. Never thought I'd want to wear cherry. Keeper. A well-mixed, niche-quality masterpiece.", "34": "A very beautiful,cozy,rich winter scent...that was my first in ideal line,but testing the original Ideal,I'd put it in front of edp.Just a bit more likeable,slightly less dense.But both fantastic releases,with the best summer frag-Ideal Cologne.", "35": "This perfume represented a great challenge for Guerlain. LE MALE, JOOP HOMME marked the beginning of a new type of male sensuality and I think the Maison thought: \"Why not us?\" It succeeds big because this fragrance is very sensual, persistent, enveloping, romantic but it also has an innocent side that is immediately highlighted by the cherry and the almond. Surprising when incense takes over.\nI believe it is sold out! It doesn't leave you indifferent.", "36": "I fell in love from the first sense. Is perfect for winter when you want to wear something warm and sweet. It's rich, elegant, unusual. It's not a typical masculine scent which for me makes it the perfect masculine fragrance. People always ask me what I'm wearing.", "37": "A vanilla dream, the kind only Guerlain can do. \nAn incredible improvement compared to the EdT.", "38": "Very unique. Not many good cherry scents for guys. You can wear this year around at the office or out on a date. I get very good projection and tons of compliments if that's your thing. Mostly I just love tonka/tobacco and leather scents and when you add the cherry to it there is just something great about it. At this price level you would be hard pressed to find something better.", "39": "This is genius. Thierry Wasser is a genius. He must be one of the best perfumers of our time. It's so often I try a fragrance, which has a terrific progression, evolving gently but clearly and naturally from top to heart to base, and which I love the smell of, and it proves to be another creation of Wasser.\n\nThis one opens soooo delicious. One of the best starts I've smelled. The cherry is yummy but not to sweet. There's a leathery dryness, a tonky soft sweetness, a sandal woodiness that balances it all fantastically.\n\nWhen it dries and the cherry is almost gone, there's a spicey smokiness that's different and just as gorgeous. A bit sweetness under it, rose? vanilla? tonka? still bound together by sandalwood.\n\nThen when I think it's through, it progressed into yet another phase... How?!?! Seems like the cherry returns or is it rose? Becomes almost a bit fresher, does the bergamot from the initial blast pop up again. And suddenly there's a bitter almond. I have problems with almond, my skin doesn't \"give\" it easily or my nose doesn't detect it easy. But there it is, popping up from under the rest and having me wonder if it gave a kind of magic to it all the whole way? In the edt it's there from start to finish, but here the other notes overrule it for me (I don't mind).\n\nYeah, this is pure alchemy. How can someone create a naturally evolving fragrance like this, where's so much (but not too much) to enjoy and keeps on going with clearly different facets. Masterfully blended. Hat off to you, Mr. Wasser! And Delphine Yelk of course, encountered her name more often as well in great fragrances. This is one to love and cherish, and it's affordable... Gonna count my pennies.", "40": "One of the sweetest and sexiest designer fragrances for men. It is a really amazing almond based fragrance and cherry makes it special.\n And also it is way better than EDT version not only longevity and sillage but the scent.\nAnd most important thing ladies love this on me which is the main reason I have 2 back up bottles of this amazing juice :)", "41": "This will be my signature daytime fragrance this fall and winter, with Dior Homme Intense backing it up at night and during special occasions. What a gorgeous and sophisticated scent. \n\nIt's sweet, but not cloying. The cherry note is very noticeable and well executed. The almond and vanilla are a lot more subdued compared to the EDT, which I personally don't mind too much.\n\nLongevity is great. Projection and sillage are slightly weaker, but not bad.\n\nI feel like a woman could pull this scent off too, but it's not overly feminine in my opinion.\n\nEDIT: I recently sprayed this on after work, and sat down for a drink. One of my female coworkers exclaimed: 'Holy sh*t someone here smells F*CKING AMAZING'. Turned out it was me. I'll be wearing this a lot.", "42": "L'homme Ideal EDP it has seemed me a good and very elegant fragrance type oriental. The first 5 minutes after application are really great, the combination of a citric with almonds, smoked leather and incense give a vibrant entry, how bad only lasts about 5 minutes, then comes a phase spicy and very sweet and warm, how could it be otherwise with the combination of vanilla and tonka bean. The middle phase is nice, but becomes monotonous and makes lose the enthusiasm of the first few minutes, the fragrance begins to look like a combination of La nuit de YSL with The One for Men and Boss the Scent, only the almond gives it a little of distinction. After about 2 hrs. the fragrance enters in its final phase   and returns to pick a nature more own and elegant, which feels powdery, with a  almond almost bitter, leather smoked  and a more woodsy body, that give a very masculine look. For me this is a  worthy  Guerlain.\nOf course, I could say that of the three versions of L'homme Ideal, this is what I liked most, though it is also the least versatile of the three, for its oriental nature is preferred to use it in cool climates, in autumn and winter or night use, but it is also a good choice for romantic use. On the other hand you could also say it is the most mature (or less younger) version of the three.\nThis version as EDP seems to me that meets very well, it has not a monster projection, but has very good sillage. My recommendation is try it to have their own opinion.", "43": "Almond, vanilla, leather, cherry... All very well blended. Nothing harsh. It's classy. High quality. I like it, but I like others more than this.\n\nAverage performance.\n\nRecommended.", "44": "Sweet seductive leathery-fruity scent that smells a hundred times better on the dry down!\n\nDon't get me wrong, the opening is magical, sweet, fruity, and spicy with a touch of freshness. But the dry down. Ouuff, it is pure liquid cocaine!! All the notes blend and work so well together with a nuanced depth. You can smell the cherry and vanilla throughout, you pick up silky leather in the background that is made smoother by the vanilla. The incense adds more complexity to the smell and makes you take deeper breaths to physically experience this beauty. I don't really pick up much of the rose but I'm sure the floral accord must blend in beautifully to people who are sensitive to that smell. To top it all off, the bottle is a classy glass bottle, shaped similarly to BDC and the effortless spray through the atomiser is an alluring experience in itself.  \n\nA massive compliment puller and makes the ladies go crazy!", "45": "This is a Masterpiece!! \nIt smells expensive,  very rich and addictive smell. \nWish it was more cheap tho lol but ill get it anyway!!", "46": "Love this one.

These are my type of scents for fall winter.", "48": "\"I'm mad at you! I'm mad at you for smelling so good. I just want to hug and cuddle you!\"\nIt takes a second for me to get the cherry note but I really enjoy it once it comes into play. I get an almond and a vanilla vibe but they both read kind of tonka ish to me. Reminds me a little of the tonka note in Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme. \nThe suede is less of a note I get and more of an overall feeling elicited. \nI'm not experiencing performance issues. I have noticed that I become nose blind/reach olfactory fatigue sooner than I'd thought since I'm still receiving compliments long past my own perception of the fragrance. \nReally nice fragrance. Excellent bottle. This and Guerlain Homme EDP are my favorite works for men by Thierry Wasser. I also am a big fan of Terracotta.", "49": "A creamy gourmandish oriental scent. Very smooth and soft. When I smell it, I get a picture of fudge on my mind. It's not too sweet due to the suede leather. It's totally unique among todays designers.\nThis is a more soft version than the regular, with more skin-tight projection. It's classy, sophisticated and delicious but I still think I prefer the EDT if I was forced to pick only one. -But as a Guerlain fan, I own both off course  ;-)\n\nEdit: -After some wearings, my status has grown from like to LOVE! Gorgeous!"}, "69": {"0": "S\u00ec is stunning! It glimmers and shines when I smell it, and it lasts eons. One application on either side of my neck lasts all day and I get pleasant, gentle gusts all throughout. What I love most about this perfume is that it doesn't really change from beginning to end, it just smells beautiful from the second you spray it until it eventually fades away. It's effervescent, sheer, and delicate, and to me it smells like an expensive sparkling drink, or maybe a wine of some kind. Not particularly floral, not exactly vanilla...it's somewhat identifiable to me. It's mysterious and opulent, and just beautiful in every sense (or scents) of the word. Just breathtaking.

I feel completely confident in saying I love Armani S\u00ec, because it makes jammy fruitiness seem as classy and chic as any french floral or arabian oud. \nTo be sure, it starts with an explosion of raspberries and continues with a smiling, sweet fuzz of patchouli and vanilla. \nDespite this hot pink cloud of fun, it has a wine like richness, and a woody smoothness that makes me think of the proper, ladylike chypres of yore. \nThus, having redeemed fruitiness, Armani S\u00ec strides with me wherever I go, making me feel like Audrey Hepburn at her sunniest.", "2": "Absolutely beautiful! \nI've always been a fan of vanilla/musk fragrances, and they've always been a fan of me. By saying this, I mean that my body chemistry works particularly well with these notes. Overly floral scents tend to pull sour on me, and I can't stand sickly sweet, celebrity-esque scents. This is the perfect balance of warm, cozy vanilla, delicate, fresh floral and slightly sweet fruitiness. \nThe first time I wore it out, I got stopped by four separate strangers asking what perfume I was wearing. On top of this, several of my male friends have commented on \"how delicious\" and \"how sexy\" I smell.

So now, she has a messy hair, with rose petals stuck between, her clothes are creased and even more, there are traces of soil on her dress.

THIS is what an average woman wants from a perfume \u2013 it's fresh, pretty and sophisticated, perfect for everyday wear but also suitable for formal events. Very versatile. People make it seem like this scent is a disgrace to the fragrance industry, and it's just not true. \nLancome has many powerful statement-perfumes, but not many everyday freshie-type frangrances like this. The only one I can think of is Miracle, which came out two decades ago. I think it's understandable that Lancome wanted to come out with an updated, more modern version of an everyday fresh-floral scent. \nPersonally, I have always loved floral scents, but I have been on a sweet-gourmand kick for a while now. When I smelled this, I was instantly mesmerized. It just smelled like me. It reminded me that deep down I will forever and always be a floral girl, even though it is often considered the \"boring\" genre of perfumery. Also, it's a delight to finally find a really long-lasting floral \u2013 this lasts at least 8-10 hours on me!", "3": "Tried it on today and I'm very pleasantly surprised. A soft, warm, clean, slightly sweet scent that quite frankly gives a vanilla impression on my skin. The pear, jasmine, and musk shone through for me. Very elegant and modern. I sprayed it on about 7 hours ago and it is still very detectable. Lovely. The bottle is genius. I also thought at first that it was too slim and posed a risk of falling until the mobile phone concept was explained to me. The bottle isn't supposed to stand on its own, but rather sits flat like a phone does. Brilliant! The bottle feels wonderfully familiar to hold whilst being more beautiful than any mobile. Relatable and aspirational. Quite the hat trick from old Lancome.", "4": "This is beautiful. Its rose but has a little bit of sweetness. Pear does usually smell sweet on me. I dont get much musk.\nI don't understand the negative reviews. If you read the notes I wouldnt think you would expect this to be ground breaking or anything like that. It is what you should expect. Pretty, ladylike, classy for every day use. This belongs in the same category as the classic and well loved Chloe which is a lot of peoples signature. That is what Lancome was aiming for here & I think they nailed it.\nThe longevity & sillage on this is amazing and I am honestly very happy with this purchase. \nI don't normally comment on the bottle but I do like how slim this is that it slips into a purse without being bulky."}, "72": {"0": "For the Culture \nAzzaro Wanted by Night was received so very well by the community that one who hasn\u2019t smelled the original would likely imagine the two to be vastly different \u2014 and they would be quite mistaken.  \nSurely the original Azzaro Wanted is fresher, but the overall scent structure is actually very much intact. If you enjoyed the original, I can\u2019t gather how you would not enjoy Wanted by Night, and vice versa. Alas, I digress. . . .  \nWanted by Night shares the same realm as the multitude of conventional date night fragrances, such as Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s The One, and The One EDP, being both warm, sweet, spicy, and sitting relatively close to the skin after application \u2014 although, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t applaud Wanted by Night for its superior performance as it pertains to longevity. Whereas with many of the typical \u201ccome hither\u201d fragrances the product is rather fleeting, with Wanted by Night, the scent has the staying power to last you well into the next morning if the need arises.  \nWanted by Night is dominated by the orange at the top, along with the cinnamon, and everything else within the provided note breakdown seems to cling to the patchouli, and ISO E Super molecule in vestigial amounts, providing an apparent, though vague sweetness that lends itself less towards a ripe orange, and more towards what would be a spicy, sugary orange marmalade. Having said that, there\u2019s something about the composition that prevents it from meandering aimlessly into the territory of gourmand, while imbuing the fragrance with an air of slight modernity, and class. Stated plainly: it smells as if you were daring enough, you could eat it, but it\u2019s clear you should not.  \nAs I mentioned before, there is nothing to be desired in the performance category. You can expect at least eight hours, with strong projection for at least two hours. You\u2019d do especially well not to immediately make your departure after application, though: the cinnamon in this fragrance is loud, and while it may very well cause the wearer to go anosmic quickly, others could easily be overwhelmed within the first thirty minutes. I mention this, because it is very likely that if you drive to your date, during your time in the closed vehicle, you could cause an encounter where the fragrance could be cloying or offensive. Because I love you I will advise you to allow the fragrance to dry down before beginning your evening. Fret not. The fragrance is somewhat linear, so that lucky someone will not miss much. \nIn the end, Wanted by Night is quite lovely. By no stretch of the imagination is it a paradigm shattering masterpiece, but it is undoubtedly a great staple in any enthusiast\u2019s collection \u2014 capable of being worn any evening not exceeding 80\u00b0 Fahrenheit. \nFor me, it is a 8.5/10. I enjoy this.  \nOn a side note: I want you to stay safe, stay healthy, and I wish you the best. See you around, superstar. Be easy.  \nVery Sincerely & Respectfully Yours, \nNobody.Really", "1": "************************************************************* 2018 Club Banger: drawn out JPG UltraMale\n*************************************************************\nI just came back from Macy with a 1-singel-spray on my left arm, and it drawn out 2 sprays of (JPG UltraMale) on my right arm, and completely erased 4 spray of (MontBlanc Legend Night) on my left wrist.

The opening is bold, delectable, inviting, intense, unique, and versatile. The cinnamon, mandarin orange, fruity notes, and incense are the prominent opening notes. The mandarin orange and fruity notes give this fragrance its delectable, fruity, citrusy, and very sweet accord; the cinnamon sits by their side with a noticeable sweet, warm, powdery, spicy, and delectable touch. The incense is one small step behind but growing fast; smoky, dark, burnt wood, and projecting, not churchy. As time passes, the incense gains strength, closely followed by a tobacco note. The tobacco in this fragrance is mild, noticeable but not pungent or dark; it blends well with the incense creating a masculine and bold accord. The next group notes provide support; the vanilla, benzoin, ISO-E Super, cedar, cumin, leather, and patchouli are part of this group. The vanilla and benzoin are prominent, warm, resinous, dense, honey, and sweet. The cedar and ISO-E Super also have modest participation, a fresh woody accord. The leather is a projecting note but lacks a specific accord. All other notes remain in the back of the fragrance. The fragrance has a noticeable opening to dry down. The opening is delectable, sharp, moist, mostly spicy, citrusy, sour, sweet, and fruity. Towards the dry down, the mandarin orange and lemon lose some intensity, the incense and tobacco grow, the vanilla and benzoin add an ambery sweetness; the initial sharpness smooths out, the fragrance becomes dry, and the incense boosts the fragrance. Once Azzaro Wanted by Night EDP has reached its full dry down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, very sweet, spicy cinnamon, fruity, smoky incense, tobacco, resinous benzoin, vanilla, and woody fragrance with spicy, green, and citrus notes. The fragrance feels ambery, bold, casual, comforting, cozy, delectable, dense, dry, elegant, exotic, fruity, inviting, masculine, mild, moderate-quality, modern, nicely-blended, nocturnal, playful, resinous, rich, short-lived, smoky, sweet, warm, woody, and very pleasant. \nBATCH REVIEWED: 2020 (#0937170)\nWOW RATING: 9/10.

I have tested it out ALOT this week but my oh my the scent is GORGEOUS.\n\nThis fragrance is a nice warm spicy and not too sweet scent which gives it such a perfect balance. It feels very seductive when I wear it but in a more sophisticated way than its sweeter winter and fall counterparts . So far in this first week of trying it I have received compliments from two of my female friends so good potential there too (one of which asked what I was wearing to buy as a gift) .\n\nOn the opening I mainly get a blast of cinnamon with the noticeable orange and fruityness which continues into to the dry down giving a luxurious scent. As it progresses I pick up the tobacco and incense subtly which makes the scent interesting opposed to it remaining linear and one dimensional.\n\nLongevity is around 10+ hrs on my skin. In terms of performance ... this thing packs a punch and is pretty strong I wouldnt call it beast mode but projects strongly for 3 hours (sometimes 4hrs if I'm lucky) on my skin and creates quite a bubble around me. I find myself constantly catching whiffs whilst walking which is bliss. Even after these 4 hours it starts to settle down but I wouldnt say its say skin scent till after 7 hrs.\n\nHonestly I have been so impressed in a short time I would say this is blind buy worthy and signature scent worthy especially if you can find it at a good price as I got 100ml for \u00a335.\n\n\nScent 9/10\nCompliments 11/10 (UPDATE I'm giving this a fat 11 just because my crush absolutely loved it when I met up with her haha)\nProjection 9/10\nLongevity 9.5/10\n\nOverall 9/10", "10": "Whereas the original Wanted is to my nose a sweet citrus, tonka bean and invictus-like \"marine notes\" odd  mixture , this new flanker is a sophisticated blend of cinnamon and dry tobacco, with a bit of patchouli and kind of a woody backbone, it's not that sweet and it's even a bit mature, maybe because of that green note I smell in it. (Vetiver? Cypress?) \n\nI smelled it the first time on someone and I directly asked him what he as wearing, I was almost schoked when he told me that was an Azzaro fragrance, and even more schoked when he told me that was a Wanted flanker! I guess it will be perfect for fall and winter.\n\nOne of the best releases this year, well done Azzaro.", "11": "Wanted by night is the first fragrance I tried by Azzaro...I saw \"New\" at Dillards so I tested and OMG .. I love it . Now is part of my collection!!!!  Sexy, woody, spicy and a bit sweet.

On me, she knows TF OW, Dior DHI and DHP, Creed Aventus, Montale Dark oud, Armani Royal Oud, Bentley Intense, Piguet Cashbah. From these ones she only complimented this azarro. And, to be honest, I like this scent as well...", "13": "This one is an exception for me as i couldn't like sweet fragrances, even the ultra male, eros and 1 million.\nBut this one is so well done that i bought it after testing.\nSweet, fruity, cinnamony and in the base somewhat woody and hint of tobacco is also there.\nLongevity and sillage are good.\nGood for nights out in fall and winter.", "14": "Bought this during the holidays. It is a very nice, spicy fragrance, which is very appropriate for Canadian winter weather. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work just as well in spring and summer, but I can\u2019t wait to find out. \n\nI get a pretty good sillage, although nothing exaggerated, and I did get compliments when I was wearing this. Longevity is overall satisfying. I would definitely recommend if you\u2019re going out at night, but I would not wear this casually in the office, as this is clearly intended to be noticed and is not really subtle. \n\nThis definitely has a youth vibe to it. It's probably best worn by young men in their twenties, but as a man in his mid-thirties, I still enjoyed it and felt like it suited me. I just wouldn't make it a frequent selection within my rotation.\n\nIn a few words: Spice and citrus bomb for a younger audience, probably best worn at night and in colder weather.\nPros: Very good performance, smooth blend of citrusy and spicy notes. Very cool looking bottle.\nCons: Not very versatile as it is best worn in the fall and winter, and probably not well suited for men 40 years old and above.\nOverall rating (out of five stars): \u2605\u2605\u2605", "15": "Ridiculously sexy, the hype is real, this is my most sprayed fragrance in quarantine. I can smell this all day all time, the women I know love it too over everything.", "16": "This one opens with a blast of fruit, like a fresh fruit salad bowl filled with melons, mandarin oranges and strawberries. A few hours in, a warm spicey cinnamin joins the fruit bowl. Shortly after the cinnamin, a blend of tobacco, leather,  Lavender,  cummin and vanilla start to emerge, but the fruitiness is always present. \n\nWhile it is a bit synthetic, Wanted by Night is well put together. I get great projection and longevity on my skin. Very much a masculine scent to my nose.\n\nOverall this is another good fragrance from Azzaro. I have been impressed with this house. Great value for good fragrances IMO.", "17": "At first, I dismissed this as clumsy and overpowering. However, I have come to enjoy it in the right situations, most of which will be boozy, slightly dressed-up nights out. I've really come to like the intoxicating spice and fruit of this frag. In fact, every time I spray this, I find myself wishing for a matching cocktail. I want a drink that tastes how this smells.", "18": "Nose\nQuentin Bisch is a genius. First Essence De Parfum then this. I love his unusual style with which he approaches modern formulas. We will see big things from him.\n\nI don\u2019t agree that:\n-It\u2019s a \u201dcinnamon bomb\u201d, it\u2019s a main player but don\u2019t define it\n-It\u2019s only for fall/winter, definitely fresh and wearable in straight summer heat\n-It\u2019s similar to La Nuit De L\u2019Homme, they share notes but not that similar. More like The One if anything, but better and more modern.\n-It\u2019s dark. It is middle ground to me. Fresh light dark maybe.\n-It\u2019s weak. It\u2019s perfectly good for a EDP. Stronger than The One edp to me. \n\nI agree:\n-It has a BO element, which just works for me. It gives the dirty bad boyish edge. \n-Similar to The One.\n\nSmell\nBroad profile, unique character. Color: red. Notes I detect are Orange, fruit, woody, spicy, incense, smoky, ambery/honey, cinnamon, minty, leathery, vanilla, juniper.. I think I can kind of smell each of these in WBN. But it\u2019s smooth and very well blended. Somehow it is kept very fresh (patchouli and fruits?) despite these heavier players. It is evenly balanced and has fruity, spicy and freshness together with that dirty tobacco incense edge to it. Masculine. Fresh with depth. A light summery fresh fragrance with a boozy persona. So perfect for summer evenings and festive occasions, but can be rocked casually on a evening walk too.\n\nDevelopment\nDoesn\u2019t develop much in \u201dstages\u201d but it gives off different whiffs.. so it is multifaceted. Gets better with time. But what you are promised in the opening is what you also get throughout the journey. I like that.\n\nVerdict\nThis is a hit and a modern classic already imho, just pray that it doesn\u2019t get reform\u2019d. Gonna take this baby out for a spin several times during summer nights. Best designer release in later years.", "19": "Azzaro Wanted by Night is a very appealing masculine scent with a good performance. It opens with a warm tobacco and leather opening but there are fruity notes in there that make the opening intriguing, sexy and inviting. This is the wow factor for me, the sort of opening that reminds me why I love collecting mens fragrances. As the fragrance settles on the skin it becomes a bit more spicy as the cinnamon and incense notes begin to play more, the tobacco is still prominent and there is something slightly peppery in there. The dry down becomes less fruity and more woody, there are the persistent tobacco, leather and incense notes but the main notes I detect in the dry down are vanilla and lavender. Wanted by Night is a fragrance that I think is a great date night fragrance and well suited as an autumn and winter fragrance. It works well when going out at night and dressed up but it also works dressed more casually having pizza and drinks with friends. So it is somewhat versatile but really shines as an evening/nighttime fragrance. I believe that both younger and more mature men can enjoy this scent. On my skin I get around 6 hours of wear from Wanted by Night and the projection is good. Overall I really enjoy this fragrance, it's one of the favourites in my collection. Well blended with an enjoyable scent trajectory with good masculine and sexy vibes.", "20": "Purchased this for my husband and it is GOLD. He smells so incredible, I can't even keep my hands off him. This lasts all day on him.  He can use two sprays in the morning and I can still smell it on him when he gets home from work. I can pick out cinnamon and pipe tobacco, and leather distinctly. Sexy, sexy, SEXY!", "21": "Ok so this is my overall take on this EDP i wont make it too long.. Ive been constantly testing It and waiting to leave a review and i honestly feel like im ready to give my honest opinion... So dont be fooled with opening i was kind of skeptical about it too but just give it a few minutes and oohhh mannn.. U get the warm sexy mysterious vibe from the woodynotes blended with cinammon and tobacco and i could honestly say im not dissapointed i purchased this at retail price ... U will fall in love with this fragrance and it Will become a part of you... It doesnt smell like anything else yea some people can compare it to other colognes out there but this here definitely has its own spot that cant be touched in the fragrance world...

As the review below me stated, the mandarin and cinnamon reallllly shine. People complaining of the cumin smell must have super strength smell. I'm no fragrance snob, but I barely get any note of cumin, especially not an overbearing smell. Great evening/night fragrance. Would totally recommend!", "24": "Boozy honey cinnamon bomb.\n\nI cant detect the tobacco but overall the opening screams of your attention, and also has an exceptional but not unique drydown. I like the smell on my skin because it reminds me of Bentley for Men Intense and some traces of Davidoff Brilliant Game---two of my favorite scents. For me this is more like-able than the original Wanted which is more of an Invictus derivative. I was tempted to try this as my summer scent but I changed my mind, it's better or rather perfect, for cold weather. So I will be checking this scent later when the winter comes. \n\n8/10", "25": "Ahhhh!!! Finally a spice that's really spicy. \n\nMy husband got this sample (ok, I signed up for it truthfully) in the mail. I liked the idea of the notes and had high hopes that it would live up to the description.\n\nIt does, and I'm very happy about it. That cinnamon, cedar (and you can TELL it's cedar, it's not that generic wood scent) is a huge aphrodisiac. There is some tobacco, but it isn't dingy or gross (as some are to me, tobacco  for men OR women's frags is really hit or miss with me).\n\nI gotta be blunt, I think people don't rate this higher in iso E super because it's elusive and maybe people don't know what Molecule 01 smells like? Or it just smells like \"perfume\", and doesn't register to the nose? I do get some in here and I can smell it on my husband, it's like a lingering spray of M-01 is still kickin' along with this frag. It's the 4th or 5th most prominent note. It just adds dimension to the whole thing.\n\nIt's hard to distinguish the vanilla, because vanilla and tobacco kind of marry and are soft together. At any rate, the dry down is vanillic, but in here it isn't boring because it fits these notes well and isn't \"filler\". \n\nThis is really good overall and I find it appealing ;)", "26": "One of the best winter fragrances in the designers world.

I have washed my self several times in the sea water today and I can still smell it on my hand!", "31": "Well done Azzaro, wanted by night is very nice, it has the DNA of the Azzaro wanted 2016, but this one smells better .. it's more woody and darker than wanted 2016.\nYou will get some compliments specially in the opening... it has a strong start.\n\nScent          8.5/10\nLongtivity     7.5/10\nProjection     9/10\n\n\nOverall        8.4/10", "32": "SWEET CINNAMON KING!!!\nGotta say, very spicy and original with the cinnamon note in this beast... Will definitely attract attention and a must buy for any guy wanting something for the holidays... The ladies will appreciate this so-----------wear with confidence!!!!!\n\n9.0/10", "33": "I'm a big fan of the original Wanted so I'll definitely be looking into this one, though they don't seem to share many notes.\n\nAlso, did anyone else notice that the juice color is similar to that of Azzaro Pour Homme/APH Intense? Nice touch there! It looks gorgeous against the dark silver bottle.", "34": "This is my signature scent. It is the first fragrance that I selected based on what **I** like. Not my father's cologne, not what my girlfriend picked out for me, not what she would later pick out for me as my wife, no. This is MY signature scent, based on what I like. Of course, I made sure to get this approved by my wife before adopting it as my own, but that is just common sense. When I decided to select my own fragrance based on my disillusionment with SpiceBomb (after a reformulation), I conducted a fragrance battle royale where I would watch videos on Youtube and read posts on reddit looking for the best men's fragrances and buy samples of all of them from microperfumes. For the ones that I liked after I got my nose on them, I bought decants which I would try on for a day or two until I ran out. Of those, this beauty was the victor. My nose isn't well trained, but I can pick up on almost all the notes listed in the pyramid and everything I smell here is amazing and well balanced. Sweet and smoky, fruity and spicy. Damn it's good. The perfumer who made this really knows his craft. I wore this as my signature scent for the last three or four years. However, after just looking for the best fragrances I missed the whole idea of wearing the right fragrance for the right occasion. I work at a local government office where one of my duties is to administer written examinations for entry into government work. One day, after we all stopped wearing masks, one of the receptionists got her nose on my sillage on my way up to my office and she, rather animatedly, complimented me saying something along the lines of \"You smell too good, you aren't administering any exams today, are you?\" Yes, in fact I was administering an exam in about half an hour and I told her so. \"Are there going to be any ladies taking this exam? You smell too good to be giving an exam to any ladies, they won't be able to concentrate on the test.\" I laughed it off, I'm not particularly attractive so I didn't think I would be distracting any female candidates in that regard, but it got me thinking. Is this fragrance too sexy for work? Is this appropriate? This launched me into my current obsession with fragrances trying to find fragrances that would be more appropriate for wearing in the summer, and to the office. Granted, if I'm not administering a test, I will still wear this to the office in the colder months. I've gotten plenty of compliments based on it, and I have never smelled it on another guy. I don't usually give ratings as I don't feel like I'm qualified, but with my extensive experience wearing this I would give it a 10/10.", "35": "I own over 20 cold weather frags, both designer and niche, and this is one of the most unique scents as I have not smelled anything like it before. Great projection, good longevity and garners compliments. Blind buy worthy, especially for its price.\n\nPS- very versatile. Can wear day or night, dressed up or casual.", "36": "I was never a fan of the original Azzaro but theres something about this one that just clicks with my nose. Maybe its the slight amber vibe that this gives off, it's just smoky, energetic and entertaining, not really sure. Like what Gosling would smell like on la-la land. I find this smells much better away from the skin though and it gives off nice woffs every now and then. Everyone says this works best as a cold weather scent but I find it really glows on me when my skin gets hot, could be surprisingly good in the warmer months I reckon. \n\n8.2/10", "37": "Fun and seductive.  Tobacco and Cinnamon and Cedar.  I don\u2019t reach for this unless it is cool outside.  Very long lasting with great sillage.  The Patchouli is noticeable as well.  Dressed up or down this is a crowd pleaser.  Top 20 for me.", "38": "Wow, I'm late to the party with this one. It's my most recently acquired fragrance having just received it today, and I'm kicking myself in the ass for waiting so long to get it. It's much closer to the original than I expected. But with myself not being the biggest fan of the original, I think that this is simply stellar! The differences there are between the two are all better in the favor of Wanted by Night. The spiciness and warmth of this fragrance is just impeccable. To be honest I've never ran across a situation in life where I can remember a smell similar to this, but I can imagine walking into a nice store in the mountains. Fire going, selling sweets to children, while a couple of men are smoking a pipe in rocking chairs in front of the fireplace. Also, they would be selling those little cedar boxes that have pictures of a postcard painted on the lid, the ones that smell very strongly of cedar. Yeah, that is definitely the picture that this fragrance paints in my mind. Awesome stuff from Azzarro ! ! !", "39": "finally got a chance to check this out, it's good, it's really good! \n\nWanted to me was just a mismatch of notes that could've been great if it were executed/blended a lil better but things just randomly stuck out and made it kind of a weird awkward scent to my nose so i didn't really think it was that good. \n\nWanted by Night is just a effin pleasure to smell! The Cinnamon + Cedar + Tobacco is blended really decently and it's just a nice warm scent that's also got some fresh appeal to it making it a great cool weather scent but because it's not overly dense it can be warn during the day with ease. \n\nThere is also something here that is kind of old school to my nose, like a 90s skin-a-max movie type of vibe going on; it's a masculine old school seductive scent that is done very well. \n\nThis is just a great fragrance top to bottom and i see why ppl were giving it high marks! \n\nI haven't actually tested this really but i feel like this scent does something that many cool/cold weather scents just don't even bother trying, making a 'fresher' style scent that has more versatility than just a evening fragrance. \n\nscent to me is a solid 8/10 (maybe close to a 8.5) but if it projects and has longevity then I would say this is great value to anyones collection", "40": "The first thought that came to my mind after spraying Wanted by Night is \"JUICY\" . I get a lot of the fruity notes in the opening, then the cinnamon makes its way and dominates the scene. My dry-down is spicy with a smooth touch of sexy tobacco. Some advertising line describes it like the scent of a contemporary Great Gatsby, and I think the slogan fits perfectly the concept behind the fragrance. It's seductive, sweet but not too overly, with the spices and the tobacco notes adding that mysterious bad boy vibe. The revolver bottle is damn cool. Commercially speaking, this is a perfect release.", "41": "Most of my fragrances are bought blindly so let me get that out the way. Wanted by night damn!!!!! Date night, work, casual, formal. Yea I wear what I want when I want. The performance is great longevity is 10+ hours, projection is great, it does so for about the first 3 hours. Sillage, ok a quick scenario my office is huge, I once remember looking for a coworker, walked into her office she was not present, walked back to my desk which is about 40 metres away, sat down and saw my phone ringing, picked up and she said \"you came to look for me just now?\" So I responded yes how you know? She said and I quote \"you left your scent all over in my office\" \nNow I just tell you how the sillage is on this. Go pick it up if you would like a cinnamon bomb!!!!", "42": "A warm spicy/cinna bomb! This is an absolute beast! My first bottle was about 3 years ago and bought another one as a reserve that same year. You can\u2019t go wrong with this beauty. It\u2019s a crowd pleaser where ever I go. A MUST HAVE! (It\u2019s my signature) ;)", "43": "A fruity, cinnamon blast with a spicy undertone. Personally, I like this better than the original. Both are good. However, I can 100% relate to those who are saying that the opener can be too harsh and sickeningly sweet. For those who are already into sweeter fragrances, you'll like this. Add it to your collection. The mids and dry down are addictive. For those who aren't a fan of sweeter fragrances, I assure you that this is a hard pass.\n\nOverall 8/10 for me.", "44": "Nighttime, club fragrance and winter/fall fragrance. You can pull it off in the summer if it's cold and, well, night :D\n\nMostly cinnamon, but an apple pie, warm like - not sharp and spicy. You can almost feel it hugging you. It's based on some fruityness, I'd call it orange or mandarin. It's not tobacco-y for me.\n\nWomen (the ones I know) love this to death, no matter the age.", "45": "Oh man i love this one!!!\n\nFantastic scent, long lasting, powerful, compliment getter, warm and fresh!\n\nThis is very very good!  I cant get enough of it! It's on my top ten!", "46": "Freshly sprayed, this reminds me of a childhood candy which certainly did not contain tobacco or woods lol. I like sweet and darker perfumes; By Night's opening has something like candied fruit...it's probably the orange and cinnamon. The notable aromatic woods and tobacco really thrive the middle and late stages. It was generously gifted to me, and to my delight it's very enjoyable from the opening to the late dry-drown! Lasts at least 6-8hrs on skin for me, projects at least moderate-to-heavy. I find this lovely EDP's dry-down as satisfying as many \"niche\" perfumes I've sampled/owned straight up...Trust me, I love finding excuses to spend too much money on pricier fragrances! This is definitely worth checking out, wear it on skin and clothes and see if you dig the way it develops.\n\nFruity-Sweet Cinnamon \nMellow Tobacco\nAromatic Woods", "47": "AWBN is in the same vein as other spicy/woodsy/sweet frags like Armani Code Profumo, One Million Prive, and Spicebomb Extreme.  I wouldn't say it smells anything like those scents, but it envokes the same seductive and cozy feelings.  As with those other ones listed, the scent lends itself more to the Fall, but I feel this one could be worn any time of day and during any season depending on the number of sprays.  For example, if you attended a bonfire party on a summer night, this would work nicely.\n\nAt the top, I get a boozy blast that is very zesty and also spicy.  That cinnamon note is not hot but it is prominent throughout.  The top is juicy, which I feel gives it this playful vibe, just like the original. The tobacco herbal sweetness is deep and masculine.  It dries down to a spicy woody scent.  Barely notice any cumin at all and the green notes are mostly subdued to my nose.\n\nGood longevity and sillage for a designer.  \n\nI could see this as a clubbing scent, but despite the playfulness, the dry down is far more complex and interesting than you would initially think.  It could be great for date night, a fun night out with friends, or even daytime festivals and late summer BBQs.  I would not wear this to the office or any occasion where you need to be taken seriously, but that isn't necessarily a knock against it.\n\nAll and all I am very pleased with this one.  Highly recommended you not only get your nose on this one but to wear it on the skin for a bit to get a feel for the dry down and the scent trail.  Also, the bottle looks awesome on the shelf.\n\nIt is unique enough to warrant a full bottle.  I give it an 8.5/10.", "48": "It's sweet, and seductive especially after the 1st hour or so.. It's cool to me, not nearly my favorite personally but women reeeaalllly love this one. Usually with colognes, men and women complement/inquirie about the scent but every single complement and question about this smell was from a woman in passing. I work in retail so I encounter countless people so it's always fun to spray something on and see the reactions. Just scrolled down and saw some dudes say how bad this fragrance is lol. I never get when I see negative reviews on fragrances that are easily, at the very least \"good\". I could be on the Aqua Di Gio page and I'm sure I'll see some reviewers say \"just awful\" \"hate it\" lol. Take it from me fellas, this isn't the best fragrance ever to me but it is pretty nice. Regular (non fragrance fan) people will love it on you.", "49": "My wife and I love this fragrance.  It smells like La Nuit de l'homme and D&G The One for men had a baby that ended up being more powerful and longer lasting than either of the parents (current formulations at least.)  The sillage will fill a room for a few hours after spraying and it continues to waft off of you all day."}, "73": {"0": "Nich\u00e9 quality and performance, designer price. Absolute hidden gem. \nThis is just the most delicious, edible, sweet, smokey, toffee-ish, rich gourmand beast of a fragrance I\u2019ve ever smelled. It\u2019s my go-to winter fragrance and every time I spray it on I feel like I\u2019m sitting next to a smokey wood fire on a cold night eating a warm goey toffee apple or sticky toffee pudding with a scoop of rich vanilla ice cream on top as someone roasts some fresh chestnuts nearby. It\u2019s just... oh man... what a fragrance. I\u2019m so glad there are so many other people here just gushing over it the same way I am. You all have exquisite taste. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb \nPros: It\u2019s absolutely delicious, and the performance (both sillage and longevity) are just fantastic on my skin, super impressive for a designer scent.

I\u2019m pretty sure my scarf still smells like it from last winter. \ud83d\ude02 \nCons: You\u2019ll smell so edible that people may actually attempt to take a bite out of you.  \nBuy it now before this masterpiece gets discontinued or reformulated.", "1": "I like this one, its stronger better\nand a longer lasting perfume than the\nalready potent original, this one is\ndarker and more intense, very nice\nsweet almost chocolate caramely with\na hint of spice, it projected very well\nand lasted on my hand more than 12 hours,\nsolid projection the first 3 hours, a great\nnew scent for gourmand lovers and those who\nenjoyed the original.", "2": "Wearing this on a chilly rainy day feels like getting a warm hug from an absent father figure in your life. \nStronger with You Intensely gives me a different impression from other vanilla-tonka bombs in the market. It\u2019s not a head-turner like Eros Flame or Code Absolu, of course it\u2019s not as luxurious as Baccarat Rouge or Black Phantom. But what it is is this relaxing and alluring scent. Not to say that it\u2019s unique tho, but it gives me a cozy feeling that makes me happy. \nThe best way to use it is to spray it twice on both sides of the neck, once on your chest and your shirt. You\u2019ll be a walking tiramisu cake for 12+ hours, and people can DEFINITELY smell you without being overwhelmed.  \nWear it on a date or a night out at a cafe, or maybe when you wanna laze around listening to jazz music in your living room on a cold day. \nIt\u2019s an adorable and a mass appealing scent with strong performance. So what\u2019s not to like?", "3": "I tried this today in store and I really like it. It has a very spicey scent to it, great for fall and winter time. It has a masculine vibe but can EASILY be unisex or a women's perfume too if it wasn't labeled so. (Coming from a women myself). A safe blind buy in my opinion and a good crowd pleaser which is still unique.", "4": "One of the most amazing designer fragrances in recent years.  \nThis can easily be worn by women too.  \nI actually prefer this to By The Fireplace, it\u2019s sweeter, spicier and more gourmand.  \nThe performance is insane. It\u2019s creamy, nutty, sexy and smells so good in cooler temperatures. I was so looking forward to Absolutely, however i was disappointed. I expected a boozy version of this, and that it definitely wasn't. \nThis guy still rules the line.", "5": "This is very sweet fragrance, sweeter then original for sure. Really pick up toffee scent, it's a gourmand and good fragrance imo. Who doesn't like the smell of sweet toffee, vanilla etc. etc. etc.??? It's nothing like Spicebomb or Spicebomb night vision? So how those comparison's got up there? It's gormound fragrance in the vein of 1 million in the sense it is sweet smelling but does not smell like one million. These gormound style fragrances are made cause they sell and are \"mass appealing\" as if that's a bad thing?.lol..just don't over spray and people around you will enjoy your scent.", "6": "Holy smokes, this is good! I blind bought this, 1.7oz for $75, because of Monika on YouTube, so many swooning reviews, and because I can\u2019t find samples anywhere.\n\nI\u2019ve been extensively sampling 50+ fragrances the last few months and have been on the fence for a while about Tom Ford Noir Extreme. I love the spicy vanilla delectable Turkish dessert vibe but NE dries down to be oversweet overwhelming vanilla. Deliciously spicy creamy and well blended up front but quickly becoming cloying and boring to justify the $200.\n\nThis blows Noir Extreme out of the water. I just wish it was called something cool like Noir Extreme so I wouldn\u2019t have to tell people I\u2019m wearing \u201cStronger With You Intensely\u201d ugh.\n\nDespite the terrible name, this is a brilliant masterpiece scent. They somehow magically and perfectly blended a classic aromatic fougere profile based on lavender and sage with that delicious sticky gourmand spicy creamy caramel vanilla Turkish dessert profile. All balanced and held in check with a light pepper and suede. Wow! How in the world did they get pungent herbs to go with toffee and vanilla and leather(!) and smell drop dead stunning?!\n\nit\u2019s like a day fragrance perfectly blended and balanced with a totally different night fragrance. And though seemingly an evening/date night type vibe overall I do feel this would work well on cold fall and winter days because of that.\n\nThis might push aside my Herod, La Nuit, The One EDP, etc etc. I\u2019m going to keep exploring this masterpiece for now though kind of sad we\u2019re heading into spring and summer and that I might need to save it all the way to fall.\n\nBy the way, the secret to this for me is ONE spray. This is so strong two sprays is borderline overwhelming and headache inducing, too sweet too peppery too cinnamony. One spray keeps it exquisite, balanced, subtle, and enticing.\n\nUpdate: picked up a 100ml bottle for $80, great deal for new in box, in case this is changed or discontinued. I\u2019ve been checking this out for a couple weeks including wearing it on one wrist with Herod on the other wrist. I\u2019m convinced this is an exquisite masterpiece fragrance and I love wearing it.", "7": "I'm not gonna debate any self-proclaimed frag aficionado on how linear or complex this fragrance is..some pple want perfumery to be rocket science so badly\ud83d\ude44 but what shld be the primary focus is determining..do u like women? & do u want women to like u?? If the answer is yes to both..wear this..just might find urself being that guy from the Playboy articles that other men roll their eyes at because they believe stuff like that doesn't happen in real life..", "8": "It took me a bit to warm up to this as this is probably the most gourmand men's scent I have *ever* smelled. Yes even more than JPG Ultra Male; but it is in that family.\n\nOn first sniff it's a tad difficult to take this seriously as this goes beyond a unisex fragrance- even to todays standards. The sweetness is undeniably beastly. On first hit you get brown sugar, caramel, marshmallows, pure vanilla extract, toffee practically every sweet morsel you can imagine in your grandmas cookie baking cupboard but on a high quality niche level.\n\nAfter the airborne cookie punches you in the face and you fear you just fell out of ketosis something mysteriously wonderful starts to happen; as it settles the sweetness remains but in dances notes of pepper, lavender, & amber- these 3 notes in particular I don't get cinnamon, suede, violet or juniper personally. This is basically a sickly sweet scent of cookies, pepper, lavender & amber.\n\nThe toffee note has a sharpness to it that is rather addicting; think the sharpness of an oceanic sea note but in toffee form. The way sharp oceanic is beautiful in the high heat this sharp toffee would be perfect for negative degree winter vortex weather in Wisconsin, ice skating, winter wonderland light shows ect. This sharp toffee experience is something the terrible Absolutely flanker after this falls short on. Absolutely is absolute trash; its a watered down fresher version of intensely without the depth. Steer clear don't say you weren't warned.\n\nOnce you warm up to this and your mind is flexible to what is deemed a masculine fragrance you will be addicted to this.

It jibes with my skin chemistry and its performance and projection amazed me. However, this is very sweet and for that reason can be polarizing.

You can fill a room by spraying 2-3 times. I tried it at the office and a colleague who was going upstairs knew that I was here because the sillage is so intense.\n\nThe drydown could be compared to Spicebomb extreme but there is no tobacco note here and the performance (longevity + sillage) of Stronger with you intensely is way better.\n\nScent : 9/10\nLongevity : 10/10 (it will last your whole day)\nSillage : 10/10 (fills a room)", "17": "This is a beautiful edible toffee, cinnamon, vanilla, tonka scent.

Only use a couple sprays, one on the chest or behind the ears and one on your wrist because this is a sweet, dense, and strong fragrance, and you\u2019ll be fine.  But the sweetness isn\u2019t anything you haven\u2019t smelled before, it\u2019s definitely along the lines of the other fragrances listed.  I was afraid this was going to be too sweet, but it\u2019s alright.  It\u2019ll have its place in my collection and get some wears.  \n\nThis reminds me of Spicebomb Extreme and Initio Side Effect, almost as if Side Effect is the niche version of this, minus the rum and tobacco which makes SE a bit drier and slightly waxy, but I find them quite similar.  Not that it\u2019s any less quality than Initio, assuming this is using less naturals considering Initio has that niche vibe, similar to what you\u2019d get in a PDM and I\u2019m sure Armani uses mostly aroma chemicals.  Just saying the two have a similar vibe and wearing experience.  \n\nI think this fits well in the Armani line, right along with the likes of Code Absolu/Profumo and a good flanker in the SWY line.  I\u2019m actually quite impressed with it considering the frags it reminds me of.  \n\nAs far as any freshness... I get some freshness in the beginning, without looking at the notes I would say an herbal freshness, probably sage, that\u2019s good for adding freshness while retaining smoothness and density, and that sticks around for the first hour or so lending it into almost oriental fougere territory...  similar to what you\u2019ll find in Pasha de Cartier Parfum, YSL Y EDP, Valour by Robert Graham.  It\u2019s quite enjoyable.  I\u2019ve been wearing it tonight for the past couple hours and I\u2019m pretty much left with that toffee... at least that\u2019s what it reminds me of... with some amber, vanilla, and some spices which have swallowed up any possible freshness from the top.  \n\nOverall, great for a designer and you certainly get your money\u2019s worth... it\u2019s VERY strong so you\u2019d be fine with a 50mL but grab the 100 if you\u2019re afraid of reformulation down the road... I also think this will hold its value.   If you tend to be ultra sensitive/critical with fragrances I wouldn\u2019t recommend blind buying as this could be too sweet or just too strong, and this is definitely a gourmand.  Like cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e...\n\nAs for performance, like others have said, BEAST MOOODE.  \nAbsolutely no issues there,  8 hours strong, but will last on skin til you shower.  You\u2019ll definitely know you\u2019re wearing it.  I live in NY, winters are bitter cold and we are currently in the middle of a snow storm and this cuts through with ease, and quite comforting lounging around the house.  I probably wouldn\u2019t reach for this if it\u2019s over 50 degrees since it would be too cloying, but that\u2019s just me.  You do you, I\u2019m sure some of you are used to more tropical weather and wearing heavier frags in higher temps ain\u2019t no thang.  Cheers.", "20": "One of the best purchases I have made. I brought this for my uncle and then ended up buying one for my father and then one myself that's how obsessed I am with it.", "21": "One of my favourite frags and one of the best gourmands I've ever smelled. If you want to smell edible then wear this. You'll smell like a delicious freshly baked cake/pastry. I wouldn't recommend wearing this everyday constantly because it can become too much.

Not enough spice, too sweet... \n\nAs a women's fragrance?  This is kickass.  It's an elevation of Angel's Share- a sweet and spicy cousin from out of town.  This is sexy Mrs. Claus.

This was a blind buy based on the listed notes and many, many positive reviews from various sources. I chose Stronger With You Intensely over the Absolutely version because there is no patchouli listed in the notes. (Patchouli is more often than not a deal breaker for me where fragrances are concerned.) \n\nThe opening on this one is sweet and warm, and strangely accompanied by a rather harsh 'tangy' or bitter aspect which undoubtedly comes from the juniper. While to my nose, the juniper is a bit off putting upon first spray, this fragrance quickly settles into an amazing boozy, sweet, caramel scent that I find absolutely fascinating. Love the smell of this in the air as the notes ascend and envelope me in a warm cocoon of cinnamon, suede, and sweetness. In the dry down there remains a depth and richness to this fragrance that is silky, sensual, and comforting if that makes sense. \n\nI've received two compliments thus far, the second of which came four hours after putting this on which is a great, real world indicator that Stronger With You Intensely has longevity and sillage that are certainly above average. \n\nHighly recommend Emporio Armani's Stronger With You Intensely with 9.5 / 10.

It's strong yet comforting. One can easily identify vanilla and cinnamon,  bringing up immediately good Christmas memories. The sweetness is perfectly toned down by the lavender, so even if one hates sweet fragrances it worths a try. Hands down for the marketing campaign I really like when there is a story behind the fragrance either real or in this case made up. It makes the scent even more interesting."}, "74": {"0": "Am I the first review here? Noice! Let me just say this fragrance is pure magic. I recently smelled quite a few fragrances at Osswald in NYC, and for me, this was the star. Of course it was sold out. I managed to walk away with only a sample, but it has now become my mission to acquire a full bottle.  \nThe opening is nice, but just wait a few minutes and the real magic begins. I have never smelled a smoother oud in my life. It is no way cloying or pungent. It's relaxing and addicting. And the patchouli/musk dry down is what perfume dreams are made of. The drydown is almost similar to my fave Aventus due to the shared patchouli and musk notes. \nThis scent somehow captures everything I love about fragrances in a single bottle. It's fresh. It's semi sweet. It's woody. It\u2019s spicy. It's blended to perfection. The bottle is beautiful. It lasts forever. Over 24 hours for me and I also still smell it strongly on my jacket 3 days later. The projection is not beastly, but it does project arms length for a good part of the day. I can't wait to own this one... \nQUICK EDIT: If you\u2019re the type who detects and detests a doctor\u2019s office note in BR540, you may not enjoy this fragrance. It does share a similar vibe that I forgot to mention. \nLESS QUICK EDIT: I am appalled by so many of these negative reviews. Reading all these reminds me immediately of why Fragrantica gets a bad wrap quite often in the fragrance \u201ccommunity\u201d. A lot of amateur noses on here for sure. This is a solid scent and doesn\u2019t deserve the ignorant reviews it\u2019s received. As always, try before you buy and do not trust what you read until you actually do try for yourself.", "1": "What does it smell like? \nSpicy/sweet/smokey/oudy.  \nNotes are lavender, saffron, nutmeg, oud, patchouli, musk. \nYeah, I know, but how does it smell? \nLet me put it this way: \nGucci Guilty Absolute: bold, aggressive, assertive and confident in a very expressive, manly way. Woody, smokey, leathery and masculine smell. Sweat, muscles, defined body, rough, dominant sex. A CEO of a big multibillion dollar company, always well dressed, always in charge, always leaving a trail where people instantly realize that he cannot he questioned. Raw, decisive masculinity in a bottle. \nOud For Greatness: you own the company, the office building and the entire block. You never mention it. When you visit the company and the CEO is approaching you to kiss your ass, you shush him without looking at him because you're listening to the janitor who's telling you how her family is doing. \nPerformance \nA single spray will by many people be perceived as strong and \"too much\" within the 1-2 first hours. I have bottled it in smaller containers, so that I can dab very small amounts, literally half of a droplet, behind my ears and on my neck. These very small dabs will project and act as a normal strong perfume for 8-10 hours. I dabbed the back of my ears 11 hours ago together with Vaseline and it still smells when I walk around. \nOn clothing, especially winter wool jackets, if sprayed richly, it will project strongly for over a month. The trail will be there for even longer.  \nPrice \nPeople on this website seem to call every expensive perfume \"overpriced\" no matter the quality or the performance. Sorry but I don't like this way of reasoning. If a perfume performs well and is well blended, it's not overpriced just because it didn't meet your expectations regarding the smell. Your personal opinion has really nothing to do with determining its value.  \nIf you don't like the smell, you shouldn't use Oud For Greatness even if you got paid for doing so, because you will not get rid of the smell for many hours. \nThe price tag on this is high. 250+ EUR. Depending on your income and your personal taste, that may be too much. But it's technically wrong to call it overpriced since it's very well blended with real raw materials. This will perform better than the majority of your current perfumes.  \nThis smell cannot, I repeat, cannot be replicated for under 150 EUR. Anyone claiming to have a cheap copy of this with equal smell and equal performance is lying. Unless they bought it from a perfume house that plans to bankrupt themselves. Raw materials are expensive. This perfume may have a price tag that is a little bit over what they usually cost. But smell it! It's insane! If you like it and you can afford it, buy it. It's worth it. It will last for a very long time.", "2": "Blind bought this for Christmas. Jeez this scent is so good. It smells like it's ultra high quality. Starts off oudy then gets sweet and smooooooth. Very strong smelling and lasts for ever. 5 star scent", "3": "I'll do it short and simple.\nScent: holy shitttt this is so God damn amazing.  \nQuality: fuckin fantastic. \nPerformance: you know beast mode, well fuck that. If a T-rex wanted a great signature scents, this would be it. \nPrice: good lord, I better start putting one of my kidneys for sale on ebay. \nConclusion: I mean, if you really don't know my take on it based on my professional review, than you need to see a shrink ASAP", "4": "Too much gives me a headache.\nJust the right amount makes me feel like sipping ambrosia from the skulls of my crushed enemies while I seize their lands, and listen to the laments of their women.\nEpic.", "5": "One of my favorites.  I don't think I've ever used the word divine to describe something, but it's fitting here. This is seductive and enticing and every time I get a whiff of myself while wearing this I feel like it's the best thing I've ever smelled.  On me it seems to get stronger as the first hour of wear progresses and then hangs around.\n\nLots of saffron and nutmeg here.  There is a hint of that same sweetness from BKR540 and Tiziana Terenzi's Spirito Fiorentino, but this is so much more complex from the saffron and nutmeg and definitely not the \"same scent.\"  It doesn't really smell \"oudy,\" but I'm guessing it just serves as a base here.", "6": "If a pile of money had a smell- it would smell like this. lol", "7": "I really don't get the BR540 comparison. Yes, they both have saffron and musk, but BR540 is much much sweeter and much more feminine. I don't get any resemblance to Aventus or Oud Satin Mood either and I own all of these fragrances.\n\nThis is a more sensual, masculine blend of oud, saffron and nutmeg. It is not an animalic/barnyard type of oud, rather, woody and smoky (I believe it is natural oud, but difficult to know for sure), very safe for most occasions. The nutmeg and saffron give it a gourmand, almost chocolately vibe. If you like this type of fragrance profile, this will be a big winner for you.\n\nLongevity was way past the 12-hour mark with 6 sprays to different parts of my skin, on clothing it will last until it is washed. It projects phenomenally, especially in the first few hours, leaving a trail everywhere. Afterwards, it still projects but within arms-length reminding you that it is there.\n\nI think if you are not used to proper oud, then you need to give it time. I think it is a great buy especially if you can get it discounted but definitely a \"try before you buy\".\n\n9/10.\n\nJust a note on Initio as a company, I think that the secrecy regarding the perfumers, notes, and ingredients causes more damage from a marketing perspective. They had perfumers such as Alberto Morillas, Guillaume Flavigny and Hamid Merati-Kashani create their fragrances but we have no idea who created what. Their website is steeped in esotericism and contains scant information about anything.", "8": "Does not smell like BR540.

Almost an overdose. Maybe it's the lavender or patchouli? Anyone else smell this? \n\nAnyone who says this smells anything like BR540 must be currently wearing BR540 and catching a whiff, because these two fragrances are absolutely nothing alike. \n\nLike others have confirmed, if you spray this on yourself, be ready to wear it for a few days! It's a BEAST-MODE in longevity!", "11": "This smells like the BR540 that the spiciness amped up. Making this masculine. Very dry and warm spicy. I can't detect the lavender.

Most used aromachemical in the industry in this decade.", "12": "I would wear it all season, any time of the day, but there are better options for days that are hot hot.

You will be kicked out of every establishment. Don't ask me how I know.\n\nLots of saffron in the front. Some lavender blended in. If there is any oud, it could be somewhere in the background. \n\nWoody, leather, soap. Where are you guys getting the BR540 from? Just because it has saffron? Cmon guys, they're absolutely nothing alike. BR540 is synthetic lab grown sugar. \n\nWould not be my clubbing spray most likely, but only because there are better options out there. Can definitely pull it off on a date, a bar, or just with the homies.

I\u2019m just a 21 year old student that wants to smell great.

Probably one of the best opening ever. Absolutely addictive.\nUnfortunately, the opening doesn't stay. But dont get me wrong, the drydown is also very good, but not as good as the opening.\n\nWhile the opening is very unisex with a strong sugary sweetness (Baccarat rouge style) mixed with the oud, the drydown is definitely masculine. A dry aggarwood who screams CEO meetings, business deal, wealth and power.\n\nNothing directly seductive. Not a date fragrance as per se, but since many women are sensible to power and position, this fragrance will have its effects in the right environment, with the right clothes.

You just judged the perfume's ingredients by its colour XD You know that the concentration of this is EAU de parfum, right?

Have you ever wondered what happens to natural oil when it is blended with huge amounts of other perfume ingredients?! Have you ever heard of filtration? or Defecation? OR... (this could be shocking to you..) Colouration?!!! Have you ever wonder how synthetic oud base fragrances could be deep brown or yellow in its colour? Take some perfumery or at least basis of chemistry classes before coming here and fool yourself.\n\nI'm not defending Initio here but let's get it straight... They might have used a small amount of natural oud from India with some synthetic oud to stabilize the blend. Have they claimed to use ONLY natural oud oil in Oud for Greatness? - No! They have mentioned that the blend contains natural Indian oud oil. Yes, it's a marketing strategy to mention the oil.

It is very well blended and I suspect that is the reason a lot of oud lovers feel the need to hate on Oud for Greatness. If you want pure, standalone oud, you are better off buying pure oud extract and wearing that instead, but don't expect compliments. The oud in OFG is blended really good in with all the other notes, and you could say oud is the backbone of this fragrance rather than being the lead note. And that is a good thing, it makes it mass appealing while being *very* addictive.\n\nAbout the price; I feel the price is justified for what you are getting. That is, a fragrance that is a masculine, sexy, addictive and unique head turner that will make you stand out from everyone else. Not only that, but the performance is simply out of this world.\n\nI think Oud for Greatness is pretty versatile, at least in the generally colder climate I live in. This will also work very well in the summer as long as the sprays are kept conservative.", "32": "My nose is not sophisticated enough to hate this. I have been sampling OFG for two weeks now and I really like it. In the opening, I do detect the BR540 DNA, particularly the Extrait. However, after 10 minutes, the similarities completely disappear.  The dry down is spectacular.  I get a mix of oud, lavender and wood. The opening is BR540, the dry down is more similar to Oud Wood, as the person below so accurately states. I am a woman, and, while this scent does lean slightly \"masculine\", it is unisex.", "33": "This stuff is absolutely insane. The \u201coud\u201d(there\u2019s no real oud in here) woody smells mixed with the saffron, patchouli, musks and lavender is incredible. Be careful when spraying it this stuff, no more than 3-4 sprays unless you want everyone to hate you. Longevity is scary, and the sillage is unbelievable.", "34": "First: What an amazing fragrance! Oh my God! 5 stars all the way.\nSecond: I'm not sure if there's real oud in it. Great imitation though.\nThird: It's a masculine scent, despite being marketed as unisex. \n\nWhy do I like it so much? It's smooth, comforting, clean and rich. Really pleasant!", "35": "This feels like a classic 80's style masculine reimagined through a modern unisex, almost futuristic lens. \nThe characteristic earthy mossiness has for the most part been stripped away but not entirely, and its combined most prominently with razor sharp lavender, piercing saffron and burnt-sugar sweetness combining to create a crackling, 3d, ethereal, modern powerhouse fragrance, with more than a nod to classic masculines of the past.\nExtremely pleasurable to wear with all day performance, both longevity and projection.\nA stunning revelation of a fragrance that is to me backup worthy.", "36": "oh I love this so much.  I dont get the hate by some of the community, this is a wonderful and sweet oud that is very wearable and lasts an eternity on my skin.  Im a huge fan of this one, 10/10 for me all the way!", "37": "Oud got Greatness?.......what oud!\nInitio sent out a bunch of free bottles to the top youtube reviewers; someone gave it a glowing review and because of FOMO on likes and views everyone started to hype this up. \n\nJust because a fragrance smells woody doesn't mean it has oud. \n\nThis is sweet, spicy, and woody, with a heavy doze of saffron and nutmeg on top to give it that warm spicy feel. \nDon't get me wrong this smells good but best oud...nah", "38": "I\u2019ve been dabbling into oud\u2019s for almost two years and have tried to wrap my nose around why people wear it and what the appeal is. Some oud\u2019s can be outright animalistic while some claim to have oud in it but nothing traceable to my nose. I bought a decant of OFG during to start of my oud journey and it was always a reference point when wearing other oud frags. No matter what I bought, nothing was as wearable as OFG. To my nose, this is the best wearable oud on my skin. \n\nFrom start to finish, this checks all the boxes. It\u2019s mysterious, attention grabbing, seductive, and lasts 12+ hours. This will always have a spot on my shelf!!\n\nCheers!", "39": "Not sure about all this talk saying there\u2019s no Oud here\u2026 it\u2019s been quite obvious to me from the moment I\u2019ve smelled it.  It\u2019s not skanky but it\u2019s definitely there.  On a side note, I heard ATH mention that, too.  I\u2019ve also watched videos where he hasn\u2019t really been able to pick out notes in other popular fragrances so I take it with a grain of salt.  I do enjoy his reviews, though.  \n\nBack to the fragrance, on my skin I smell a sterile, medicinal Oud and lavender\u2026 the saffron and nutmeg push out more to create a slight leathery and smokey scent cloud.  I\u2019m very familiar with saffron, I use it often in recipes and it\u2019s blended incredibly well here with the Oud.  It\u2019s so refreshing to not have rose as the secondary note.  Slightly animalic musk and an earthy patchouli also play a big part here, as well.  \n\nThis is a very bold, deep, resinous, aromatic fragrance that\u2019s multifaceted and very complex.  You can clearly tell this has been made of high quality ingredients and has been masterfully crafted.   I\u2019m surprised the fellow below me here called this generic\u2026 of my 180 bottles I really have nothing that smells like this and if I\u2019m being honest, even though this isn\u2019t one of my favorites it\u2019s still one of the highest quality frags in my collection\u2026 and I\u2019d like to think I have a decent amount of good ones to pick from\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think this was attempting to smell like BR540.  Perhaps there was some inspiration to ride the coattails but I think that\u2019s about it.  Really the only thing the two have in common is the saffron and they\u2019re utilizing it very differently.  Oud For Greatness has hardly any sweetness, it\u2019s more savory and natural smelling as opposed to the synthetic candy-flossed nature of BR540.  In fact, I think this has more in common with MFK Oud EDP and even that is far fetched.  \n\nAll in all,  I think this is a fantastic Oud fragrance that\u2019s very well composed.  It\u2019s super sexy and alluring with perfect longevity and silage.  Projects decent for the first 5-6 hours before resting as a heavy skin scent until it\u2019s washed off.  Literally, Oud For Greatness has \u201ceternal\u201d longevity.  I\u2019m assuming if I wasn\u2019t to shower for a week it would still be on my skin, as if I just applied it 12 hours ago.  Incredible for an Eau de Parfum.  \n\nAs for the price\u2026 for a niche fragrance of this caliber I think it\u2019s alright.  I don\u2019t ever recommend spending $350 on a fragrance or paying retail but if money isn\u2019t an issue and you\u2019re a connoisseur, go for it.  At around $180-$200usd Inthinknits well worth it.  Considering it\u2019s performance and longevity it doesn\u2019t get much better than this and you certainly get what you pay for.  \n\nI suppose you could also look into Oud For Glory or Afnan Supremacy in Oud at a fraction of the price but I\u2019ve never smelled them.  I can imagine they have excellent performance as well, lasting at least 12 hours but with some minor differences in scent and quality.  Again, I\u2019m certain Initio uses real Oud and a good dose of naturals and other high quality molecular compounds to justify the price.", "40": "I absolutely adore this! \n Going to have to really sample it to make sure but initial spray had me bowled over.\nNot much in the way of Oud synthetic or real, certain not real but I don\u2019t doubt it\u2019s there because there\u2019s a woody, amber heft to this fragrance. It\u2019s warm and stunning in the opening with quite a sweeter saffron note and I get nutmeg in there too, it\u2019s a heady brew of stuff I like. Hugely powerful and having said all this nice stuff about it and loved it so much am I left mouth agape standing back in awe of this thing...well No. Not really. \nI love it. I\u2019d like to wear it and own it and I know that love would grow into a real fondness but does it have the wild chemical attraction of a love at first sniff? Not quite. That kind of relationship is doomed to fail anyway so maybe this is \u2018the one\u2019 for me? Just a sensible one. \nI will update this when I acquire proper samples.", "41": "Second wearing of Initio Oud for Greatness some ten months after initially trying it out, following its late 2018 release, and it\u2019s still quite the interesting spicy oud fragrance that has once again become seasonally appropriate with the weather cooling down.\n\nIts blend is full of provocative notes\u2014oud, patchouli, saffron, lavender, patchouli, musks\u2014and it\u2019s a strong arrangement, with some lavender to add freshness, nutmeg to add spicy, and saffron as a wildcard to complement what is dominantly an oud/patchouli blend, slightly reminiscent of Parfums de Marly Nisean in its general sense but even more vaguely like a Montale or Mancera aoud/oud-named fragrance, albeit slightly more complex.\n\nOud for Greatness feels rather floral on my skin, too, as I imagine there being rose or something similar in addition to the lavender.  It\u2019s not particularly sweet but more a spicy woody oud, though not an especially animalic oud, but a \u201csafe\u201d or \u201csmooth\u201d oud, as I\u2019d usually classify it.\n\nIt\u2019s solid winter staple, in short.  This is something I could wear regularly and not get tired of it, even if I\u2019m not particularly amazed by it.  As a side note, its bottle is beautiful, the eye reminding me of masonic imagery from National Treasure, clearly a visual upgrade from the other more sober Initio bottles in the same shape.\n\nIt\u2019s for sale at great retailers like Perfumology, Osswald (from whom I obtained the sample), and Beverly Hills Perfumery, but doesn\u2019t come cheap, at only the 90ml size for $350 though there are sometime sales to be had. \n\nI really like it, overall, but I don\u2019t think I need a bottle, maybe just a large decant.  Rehab remains my favorite of the Initio line, though Blessed Baraka is another one that I\u2019ve wanted to do a full sampling of.\n\n7 out of 10", "42": "A refined yet safe oud fragrance that smells sophisticated and sexy on my boyfriend.  It\u2019s fairly linear and doesn\u2019t waver, which aligns with my opinion throughout the lifetime of the fragrance.

OFG is predominantly woody, dark, dry.", "43": "It seems like @perfumeaddict is mad a t Initio because they blind bought a $300 dollar fragrance LOL. Anyway, this fragrance is beautiful to me.

And yet, i have to smell the atomizer daily when i approach my collection deciding what to wear for the day, it's that addicting.  Imagine that, i don't like the fragrance and yet im addicted to smelling the atomizer daily...lol  \n\nA member here told me once, \"Give your nose time to develop.\", and i understand what they are saying now, our brains need time to stamp the info of fragrance notes & complete dna's when testing to understand the more complex fragrances out there.  Oud For Greatness is personally one of those times.\nAfter 2 years on my journey, i have an understanding of this dna and it's notes where i can confidently say this is a very special ground-breaking fragrance.  \n\nThis is one of the most strongest fragrances i've ever smelt in my entire life, 2 sprays and you're good for the day, and it will fill a room, and leave a long sillage trail anywhere in public - even outside in the air.  So you are getting your money's worth here, granted, it's expensive to begin with.  At least a little goes a long way.  It's beautifully blended and a gorgeous dark mysterious dna.  This is also a great frag to layer with other frags that are too sweet, giving it a touch of smoky Incense to cut through & balance off the sweetness.\n\nThis is a 100% 'test first' before you buy fragrance, as it's new, innovative dna, that's extremely strong and challenging to some noses.  Some people, mainly women fall in love with it on first sniff.

Some say it is better now, but most remark on how much weaker or worse it is now. \"It's just not the same as it was when I was in high school\". Has anyone considered the fact that WE are not the same as we were? Our body chemistry has changed. Our sense of smell has changed. Our opinions are based on different criteria now. This smells better on my uncle Joe than it does on the guy I don't like at work. When I was a kid, the county fair was a shiny. bright, wonderland of colors and smells.

Yea, can you tell, I'm in lust! \nI'm still waiting for the heavenly drydown that many write about, and I'm sure it won't fail to impress. \nIf you like, what appears to be a classic fragrance that hits you all over with citrus and flowery notes, which I do, then you'll love this juice. \nUPDATE: The middle and base notes just kicked in about 30 minutes later - all I can say is wow, it really is heavenly. \nHIGHLY recommended.", "3": "L'Eau d'Issey Pour Homme is one of the few fresh fragrances that really last long on me, along with Un Jardin Sur le Nil by Herm\u00e8s and Kenzo pour Homme, so that's a big plus! \nWell, when I first smelt this fragrance, I was very intrigued by the smell: I smelt ice. Dry ice. \nIt is icy, pure, crystalline, cold, breezing, spicy, flowery, watery, oriental and refreshing. \nIt's a blast of fresh energy that you receive, and that you walk with all the day long. \nI felt immediately in love with this perfume, and it's one of my summer signatures. \nIts longevity is insane for a fresh and summery fragrance, and so is the sillage: everyone will notice you, principally in the first hour \nGirls find this perfume extremely seductive and sexy, so it's a compliment getter, for sure! \nIssey Miyake did a great job creating this masterpiece, that still remains super actual in these days, and it will remain for many more. \nA legend.", "4": "It's clean, fresh and timeless scent.

I absolutely agree with everyone who pointed out the similarity to these fragrances. Gently Fluidity has the same vanilla and the same clean, synthetic smelling musk. There is no rose listed, but I smell a hint of the same wine-tinged rose. The main difference is that the rose is much less pronounced and that this is a softer, more versatile, easier to wear fragrance. The woody and spicy notes are there, but very subdued. They make the opening smell a little papery, and that's about it.  \nGentle Fluidity Gold is creamy and sweet, but not really gourmand, with a subtle fizzy sharpness. It's very bright and not as warm and deep as I expected from something called 'Gold', but I still like it a lot. If it was gold, then a lighter and cooler tone of it, glistening in the sunlight. I haven't tried the silver version so I can't compare.\nThe performance is very nice, it's not an overly loud scent but it has a presence and lasts all day.", "2": "Let me begin by saying whilst I appreciate the art of silver fluidity, I wouldn\u2019t wear it. I\u2019d go as far as suggesting I dislike it. That reflects my disdain for the key notes and how it dried down like Green Irish Tweed. Gentle Fluidity Gold is stunning. Maison Francis Kurkdjian is an absolute artist. How he managed to take the same notes and develop two completely different fragrances that lay at either end of my olfactory appreciation distribution is beyond me to understand. I suspect sorcery. Gentle Fluidity Is smooth, sweet and more complex than any simple fragrance I\u2019ve encountered. Amber takes a back seat to what is essentially a spiced gin and tonic, but remains warm. How is this possible? Juniper isn\u2019t warm. Gin and tonic isn\u2019t sweet. I am constantly challenged by Maison Francis Kurkdjian and I love him for it. Remarkable.", "3": "honestly, i love Francis, but to do something so similar to Montale intense cafe in 2019 is a little bit dissapointing.

They did name it right it\u2019s gentle, soft, warm and cozy. But yet still a little musky and sexy vanilla as well. Silage and longevity are beast mode as well! It\u2019s such a gorgeous fragrance that is perfect for a signature scent in my opinion. This fragrance is so underrated. I actually think I like this more than BR 540 if that\u2019s at all possible. This fragrance smells nostalgic and yet unlike any other fragrance I have ever smelled. This is a luxury fragrance at its finest to me.

He decided at the ripe age of 43 that he would go to college to be a teacher. With a full time job, it's been hard to get classes in, so he's been sucking it up, and taking one class per semester, at night, after grueling weather conditions, building houses.  \nThe honors society recognized that he was a straight A student and asked him if he would like to join phi theta kappa. What an honor! He joined, and for the first time, I saw a glimpse of proudness in his eyes.  \nThen...He has to be inducted into it....which meant he would have to stand with the rest of the people who joined, in front of everyone. I guess that is too embarrassing for \"rock stars\" to do, I don't know. Haha! \nSo we walk in, the room is filled with 20 something year old people, with their proud parents and grandparents....and what filled the air from the 20 something year old girls was \"bright crystal\". Just a happy, comforting scent that seemed to smell like \"sweet success\" in a sense. He's walking in a single file with the youngsters and I could see it in his eyes...\"why do I have to do this dumb sh*t, I am (now) 45 years old!\". He is standing with his society brothers and sisters repeating these \"code of honor\" words, and in that moment, I felt so proud. He is my love, my light, My everything. The \"bright crystal\" that flowed through the air that night will always bring me back to that proud moment in both of our lives. I just bought a bottle :)  \nNothing special? Maybe to you....but it definitely is special for me. This scent is clean, beautiful, innocent, light, crisp, with the slightest hint of enchantment. This is not my usual style, I am more of an orientals kind of gal...but I think it's beautiful. Just like his bright eyes. He will graduate around 50 years old (because of balancing a full time job) and I will definitely be wearing bright crystal at graduation.

It's more like tranquil music as background. A sunny bright (oops!) day at the park. For the girl wearing a white sundress,her hair up in a pony tail while having an ice cream cone. This adds the perfect final touch before you run out the door to face the dirty, gritty city. It's that little extra sparkle.You'll feel fresh and put together.

I have an extremely sensitive sense of smell, and am very hard to please where perfumes are concerned. Back in 2007, I searched high and low for a new signature. I spent many days at the mall, smelling hundreds of different perfumes in person. Until I found this, that is. The first time I smelled this, I was hands down in LOVE. I knew it was the one instantly and I bought it on the spot.  \nIn the last 4 or so years, I have made many attempts to venture outward and find myself a new signature, and in all that time, I have not found a single scent that I feel is worthy of replacing this as my signature. In the 9 years I've been wearing Bright Crystal, I get compliments on it almost daily. I remember when I first bought it, I spritzed it on immediately, and went home where my family was too, in awe! My mother loved it, my grandmother loved it, my aunt who doesn't even wear perfumes loved it! So much so, that both my mother and grandmother went out that week and bought themselves a bottle!  \nThis is a FRESH and clean smell. It's very floral in nature, but not at all overpowering. I think it's balanced gorgeously and is very sensual, yet 'sparkly' - I truly feel like I glow when I wear it, it's very warm. When first applying, it gives off a nice hint of lotus and pomegranate, and after some time, really lays on smooth with a soft amber smell, with very slight musk. The longevity is great, lasts me all day and night and the layers of each note just melt off beautifully, revealing an even more sensual scent. I think it's a great anytime perfume, day and night - all seasons - although I think it is more of a summer scent.  \nAnd since I have met my partner, it seems I'll never be allowed to change it now!

After 6 hours of sweating my ass off and around 1.5 hours of swimming/being in the water, I could still smell it when I was walking home. What more do you need? \nMaybe 75% of fragcomm hates this, but the remaining 99.99% of the world will either like or love this scent. So I will gladly wear it. \nScent: 8/10 (my opinion) 10/10 (most women's opinion) \nProjection: 9/10 (I get around three hours of heavy projection).\nSillage: 10/10\nLongevity: 10/10 (12h+ on skin. Never sprayed it on clothes, because 12h is perfect for me)\nVersatility 9/10\nUniqueness: 9/10 (Even though it has the performance and 'sweetness' for colder days, I still consider the EdP a freshie. I will wear this in spring/summer)\nPrice-performance: 7/10 (Because this one and the EdT are very similar, I would advise the EdT when money is 'an issue'. I ended up buying the 200ml EdT for \u20ac5 cheaper than my 100ml EdP bottle) \nTotal: 8.75/10"}, "79": {"0": "The Terminator from Terminator 2\nMartin Riggs from Lethal Weapon\nJohn McClane from Die Hard\nDetective Gino Felino from Out for Justice\nJack Burton from Big Trouble in Little China\nBlade from...Blade \nIf you are incapable of defending your old lady's honor in a bloody street fight, direct your feeble arms to Versace Eros, because Dior Fahrenheit is too heavy for you. Puberty is not enough to wear this. If you spray this on you, and you can't change a tire, you look as ridiculous as a toddler putting on his father's work boots. This is inescapable, and everyone will know.  \nYou do not wear this with shorts, sneakers, or formal wear. (You may wear it barefoot if you are shooting terrorists in Nakatomi Plaza.) Neither casual nor formal, this fits a certain animal in the darkness of society. This is for the sons whose mothers ignored Willie Nelson and let them be cowboys. This is for the pool hall around shady characters, the lone and fearless walks down the alley, work boots during the week, \"going out\" boots during the weekend, and lifting heavy objects seven days a week.  \nThe delightful \"gasoline\" opening goes away after a few minutes. The drydown brings me back to the fire academy, where our classroom and equipment smelled like burnt hay after our training. The nutmeg, cedar wood, vetiver, leather, and musk notes make something classic. It has *just* enough floral notes to make it clean and elegant.  \nIf you grew up in the late 80s and early 90s, you know this fragrance from that special someone who smoked Marlboro Reds and could be counted on to handle anything. They were like shooting stars, too good to live long or find a place in our fluid society. However, this fragrance is a classic because of them.  \nWhether intentional or not, the red bottle's symbolism is prescient; it is unapologetically not blue. There's an appeal to fresh and sweet fragrances, as the men's fragrance industry is catering directly to women's wishes, but Fahrenheit is not for simps.", "1": "I worked for Christian Dior when Fahrenheit was the blockbuster of the era. I loved it and wore it constantly. It smelled very differently back then. Although made for men, we were directed to market the fragrance as unisex at a time when the term \"unisex\" only applied to hair salons. \nI'll never forget the time a young lady came in saying, \"I'd like to try Fahrenheit\", adding with complete innocence, \"It's bisexual.\"", "2": "The 2020 version is a gasoline bomb, folks! They have figured it out ... finally! It smells exactly like the juice in my old 90s bottle! I am stunned! ... AND delighted! My batch code is 0A01. Look for it!", "3": "\"The Smell of An Ex-Husband\" \nI don't hate my ex-husband, but we had a turbulent marriage and separated over 10 years ago now. I'm the one who selected Farenheit to be his signature scent when we were first dating. We were in a department store, I sprayed it on him, and promptly wanted to climb his bones. This was probably around 1997 or so. He loved the scent himself but mostly liked how I reacted to it. He wore it for at least the next 10-12 years. I don't smell it around so much these days, but when I occasionally do I still think it smells fantastic and sexy. It was a groundbreaking scent back in the day. It's still tied to mostly good memories for me. But, yeah, it does also make me really sad. It smells a bit of a lost relationship and lost youth. I can't believe the 90's were so long ago, but they were. I wish I could go back and hug that girl who gifted her then boyfriend Fahrenheit. I wish I could tell her some things but mostly that's she's good and she'll be fine and to just mostly focus on living her best life and being true to herself. \nAnyway, Fahrenheit is a complete and utter masterpiece. Unbelievably f*cking sexy and masculine. BEYOND BRILLIANT 10/10", "4": "I was born in 1990, two years after Fahrenheit was released, so I guess you could say I was born into a Fahrenheit world.  \nIn fact, one of my earliest memories is of Fahrenheit. It's almost as if it was destiny. I remember being a small child in a family member's car. Left alone and bored, I started opening drawers and compartments. In the glove compartment I found a strange bottle. It was shiny and vibrant red. I had never seen anything like it. I took it out and held it in my hand. Stared at it for some time. I had no idea what it was, I don't even think I smelt it, but the image of that bottle was burned into my brain indefinitely.  \nFlash-forward almost 20 years to the beginning of my perfume journey. I walk into a local store and notice the same bottle. I approach it, like an old toy a friend had but never shared with me. I spray it on a tester strip. I smell it. I am confused. I am disgusted. Who would want to smell this, let alone wear this...thing? I leave the store disappointed and heartbroken. \nI don't know why I ordered a decant of Fahrenheit afterwards. Maybe my curiosity wasn't satisfied. Maybe I couldn't let it go. Even if I couldn't wear it, maybe I could hoard it and study it. Reference it like the bible or an encyclopedia. When the decant came I smelt it again. Oof. Still bad. But I promised myself I would wear it, and I hesitantly sprayed it on my wrist. The first 15 minutes were odd. It still smelt strange to me, but there was something else there, something beautiful. I continued throughout my day, working the bar as I normally did at that time in my life. And as my day continued into night, Fahrenheit lingered. I began catching whiffs of the most beautiful, airy, green, spices and leather. I was enveloped in it. And almost all at once it hit me. The \"A-ha!\" moment and I was in love. \nFahrenheit is a work of art. It was the catalyst experience that turned my nose away from the simple hygienism of modern commercial fragrances and turned it towards the genius and artistic creativity of perfumery. This is not a bar of soap or a bottle of shower gel, this is a story with an arch, a turn, a climax. Masterpieces live like humans. They are born, they grow, they develop, and they endure. Fahrenheit is dynamic. Classic and modern, timeless even over 30 years later. (It is also important to know that perfume is meant to be worn and, therefore, interact with the chemistry and movement of the human body. Do not let paper impressions dominate your opinions of fragrances.) \nIn summary, Fahrenheit taught me what perfumery is: an art form. Just like listening to Schubert or watching a great film, you must be willing and ready to witness genius. Not everyone is.

I'm not sure what issue you could have with this. I feel like a lot of people dislike celebrity scents in general and aren't open-minded about some of them actually being good. It\u2019s not groundbreaking, but I do like how it smells a lot! It's very vanilla/chocolate heavy with a little spice on the dry down. The projection is close to the skin for sure. Even with over spraying it would be moderate at best, but I can smell it on me from earlier today so it lasts at least 5 or so hours.

Is it groundbreaking? No. Is it comforting and cozy? Absolutely. \nIt's more complex than I thought it would be. Also more cocoa than I thought it would be. And thankfully not cloying in its sweetness. I prefer my vanilla with a bit more resin. I would've loved to have had labdanum in this instead of tonka. However, Eilish is an easy wear and very likable. I put four sprays on my forearm and after 10 minutes or so I can only smell it from about 10\" away. It's diffuse so I'd say it's office friendly, as well. I can't speak about performance or longevity yet as I've only been wearing it for about an hour. \nThe bottle is far larger than I thought it would be and is difficult to hold but definitely makes a statement. \nConsidering she's 19 and this is her first foray into fragrances I think it it all bodes well. Job well done, Billie! \n.......\nUpdate: basically linear after the first hour. For the first hour, the berry and the cocoa jockeyed for position behind the vanilla. It became a skin scent after about 3 hours. It still smells nice when I press my nose to where I spayed it but there's no projection any longer.", "3": "I really like this! The bottle is huge and a little hard to hold, but looks cool on my dresser next to my more mainstream bottles. This scent IS like a warm embrace. It starts off with the berries and the spices and then I get the cocoa and vanilla. It kind of reminds me of Vanilla West Indies (a favorite of mine that\u2019s been out of stock for over a year) but softer and more nuanced. The longevity is really good. I wore it yesterday and could still smell it about 7 hours later. I think Ms. Eilish did a great job on this perfume. While it\u2019s not groundbreaking, it\u2019s a beautiful vanilla without being overly sweet or cloying. My 22 year old daughter loves it as well.", "4": "I had expected something more musky, but this is heavily vanilla scented and quite sweet\u2026however, I\u2019m delighted with it! To describe this perfume as \u201cnostalgic\u201d is an understatement. It reminded me of Bath & Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar, Vanilla Frosting Lipsmackers, and after about 12 hours, Lucky Charms. It brought a variety of childhood and teenage scents back to me at once, and it made me smile. I think Billie herself described it as a warm embrace, and that feels strangely accurate. Like giving a younger version of me, wearing pony beads and body glitter, a big hug. But don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s got substance and some staying power and notes that you won\u2019t find in a body spray cloud before a school dance. It\u2019s just interesting enough to please the adult in me without relinquishing any of its nostalgic glory. If you\u2019re not into vanilla or are looking for something complex, this won\u2019t be for you.

No other perfume has ever had this kind of effect of my skin. \nI found the combination by pure accident as I happen to be on of those people that can't smell Molecule 01. To me it just smells like alcohol and I only tried to spray it on top of Gris to see if it makes it last any longer and it normally only lasted 2-3 hours for me. By applying a spray of M01 on top of the Gris Charnel it definitely made the projection a little stronger, but that's not all. Every once in a while, maybe once an hour, for the next 8-12 hours I would get a single inhale out of nowhere and it was absolutely magical. I don't know how to describe it.

I think the retail price is reasonable at $190 for 100 ml. from Luckyscent. \nBut, my bottle of IF by Frapin just arrived in the mail today. This is voted most similar to Gris Charnel, and I must agree. I bought it from Krystal Fragrances in Kalispell, Montana for $125 for 100ml\u2014less $40 because it\u2019s on sale. With free shipping and no sales tax, I\u2019m really happy with my purchase.  \nI do want to note some differences between IF and Gris Charnel. IF is spicier and brighter, Gris Charnel is smoother, fruitier and sweeter. The tea note is probably the biggest difference, making Gris Charnel lean more femme on my skin. Otherwise they are cut from the same fig and sandalwood cloth.  \nI love them both, and feel fortunate that at least one of them is in my collection. I also love Santal Blanc by Van Cleef, another that is voted similar. Anyway, there are others I\u2019m pining for, so Gris Charnel, for now, is a pass.

Generally described as \"boozy,\" and while that might be the easiest single descriptor, there's a lot more going on. \nBentley Intense is boozy in a whiskeyish sense, but largely supported with leathery and woody aspects. More biting and the opening and better-blended in the dry down, I liken this to D.S. & Durga's Bowmakers or even Thierry Mugler A*Men Pure Wood in terms of character, even though neither is truly a match. Projection is outstanding and longevity is very good, as well. Not surprisingly, then, this is an fragrance that should largely be reserved for cold weather or at least nighttime situations. I'm wearing it casually today but I'd actually regard it as more of a formal, semi-signature scent. \nThis is a great discovery, and certainly is the exception to the trend of poor designer fragrances coming from non-fragrance brands (the 24 line is similar in this respect), and at its price, this needs to be tried by any men (most men, I imagine) who enjoy some amalgam of boozy, woodsy, or leathery (I wouldn't say tobacco, in this case) accords.

This fragrance is crazily perfect to me. At first spray, you may think, \" Oooh, that's nice!\" At first you get the soft rose plus an added sweetness of lychee. \nThe scent smells rosy, *slightly* fruity and a bit powdery. People say it smells like baby powder - no. It smells like a floral/slightly fruity powder. The floral isn't white florals, it's delicious rose, specifically Turkish delight. If you've ever smelt rosewater with sugar, that is part of this fragrance. About a 5th of it. The rest is lychee, slightly vanilla, Oud, smokey, powdery. \nThe sugary rose combined with the sweetness of lychee, plus the powderiness of musk is what determines this fragrance. If you live in Australia, you know what musk sticks are. This has a decent scent of musk sticks lollies. And it lingers. I assume this scent isn't mentioned a lot here because I think musk sticks are only an Aussie/NZ thing. But this definitely smells of roses and musk sticks, plus sugar, lychee, and deliciousness. \nTo begin with, it doesn't smell gourmand. \nIt smells rosey,sweet and powdery. \nThen it develops to this insanely gorgeous scent. \nSillage: 10/10 - My hubby could smell it 2 rooms away.

Don't spray it and walk out of the house. Spray it about 15 mins to half an hour beforehand - you will be projecting the most delicious scent ever!

And that is during COVID-19 where the supermarkets limit customers and have lines on the floor for social distancing! I have been out of the house twice for necessities. \nUnfortunately I don't need to leave my house for quite a few more days so I won't have any more updates for a while on the compliments. \nConclusion:\nYou will smell expensive and unique. It IS slightly powdery, like I was warned about beforehand. But it's not baby powder at all. It's a rosey, musk stick powder with a slight sharpness of lychee. Lychee is a lot more prominent after 3 hours during this fragrance. Usually fresh scents like lychee (or litchi as said in the USA) disappear fast. It sticks around here. It is a creeper lol. It's fruitiness rears its head after an hour or so. And it's yum. \nIs this a gourmand? It's hard to say. But no.\n4 hours later? Yeah, it's slightly gourmand. But still no - kinda. It's not fresh, it's not spicy, it's floral, and a teeny bit fruity. But powdery musky \nIt isn't creamy to me like some people say, it's more powdery.Not like baby powder. More like a warm, musky powderiness (musk doesn't seem to be mentioned) that lingers for 8+ hours. There IS a sharpness, assuming that is the lychee. \nGeez I wish we had a scratch and sniff phones! It would make my description so much easier lol. \nBottom line: It has amazing projection, it smells incredible, it smells like a classy girl who is going to a fancy dinner in her best dress (I can imagine this as a wedding dress scent!)\nThis scent is the shit. \nI've never smelled anything like it, it's amazing.  \nStay safe during these hard times, social distancing really works, black lives matter, help those who are less fortunate xxx", "2": "Hello,\nIf you are like me, and read these reviews before purchasing, I wish someone had written this smells like exactly like the little candy white cigarettes that had a a red tip on the end that were sold in the 90\u2019s in my local school milk bar, it was a sugary middle Eastern rose scent smell. \nWhen I sprayed it I felt disappointed because I felt I smelled \u201ccheap\u201d(young under 11 years old) sweet not \u201csuductive\u201d (18+) sweet\u201d.\nTo my SHOCK when my boyfriend & I were going out for Sunday lunch, I took this off my mantle and got him to tell me which he preferred.

Immediately, you get that salt accord with a very heady but clean jasmine. I'll agree with others that first and foremost, this IS a jasmine perfume before it is a vanilla perfume. The jasmine is fragrant, tea-like, and done in a very feminine fashion... this is no Alien jasmine, which is loud and angular. The salt adds just a bit of a metallic tinge to offset the sweetness of the jasmine and cuts through the thickness of the incoming vanilla. The vanilla in this is more bean-like than it is cake or extract; a very natural vanilla with just a bit of smokiness. As the perfume dries, you can really pick up on the cashmere wood (cashmeran) and ambergris (ambroxan), which adds texture and makes this perfume have more of a beachy vibe. In the drydown, Olympea evokes the scent of sweet, salt-licked skin. This is very beautifully done and well-balanced. \nThis is great for all seasons and all occasions.

I'm actually surprised how much I like it. It's not an ordinary perfume. It's intriguing and quite addictive.", "3": "I was not going to buy this one as I bought many others lately. But every time I went to the store I couldn't help spaying it. Just because I thought it was a little unusual. Savoury , something really attractive. \nSweet vanilla ,,,,, salty wind by the sea , this is summertime by the ocean to me. \nNot a scent a normally go for but I really enjoy this. I like the sweetness of it , the vanilla and the salt is just fabulous ! And ambergris and sandalwood is always amazing to me in a fragrance. , so it has a lot I love ,,,, yet I dislike to much jasmine , not sure about ginger and something in it to me reminds me briefly of womanity ,but not the silver spoon taste I get from womanity. I suppose the attractive side of womanity ! And yes there is a lady million vibe going , a scent I always wanted to get but never did and partly because of the bottle .  \nOlympia starts with a fresh , mandarine ,citrusy spicy , jasmine scent which can be off putting to my nose ,,,,but then quickly goes into a absolutely wonderful vanilla salty stage ,,,,this is when I go crazy over it. And obsess completely ,,,, then the drydown is phantastic with the ambergris and sandalwood , warm creamy but still airy in a way , never heavy ,, this makes a great summer fragrance!!! It's uplifting ! \nUpdate , great summer perfume, wearing it a lot , my husband likes it he said it smells like Florida , this time he is not so far off.", "4": "A wonderful fragrance!  \nI recently took my husband with me to fragrance shop, bless his heart lol. He was patient and smelled everything I presented to him on test strips. But he always came back to Olympea as the one he liked most. (I found it to be love at first sniff by the way) \nVanilla, salt and water jasmine were the most prominent notes, on the dry down some of the other notes come in to play, slightly powdery and a little sweeter. Great longevity and sillage. Delicious! \nAnd? Anything that makes my husband say, \"you smell yummy!\" is a win in my book :o)"}, "87": {"0": "We bought the 200ml for my father's 60th birthday...I had no idea perfume could smell like this. My father saw how in awe I was of this perfume and he generously gave me the massive decant gift that came along with the large bottle. I had never smelled, let alone owned or worn a fragrance like Oud Satin Mood before. I could not stop smelling my clothes from that night. It smelled like some sort of insanely rich and opulent turkish delight of roses, smooth resinous oud, and breathtaking vanilla. I wore it to work and people literally told me that my office and I smelled delicious! Within a month I got myself the 70mL bottle.  \nIn a word, the dry down is heavenly. Performance is incredible, the sillage is serious enough to cut through a packed wedding hall with all manner of \"Allure Homme Bored To Extreme\" and \"Who De Chanel?\"  \nOud Satin Mood started my journey, and will always be special to me. \nThe smell is to die for. It changed my life.  \nFrancis Kurkdjian is a legend and this is 2nd only to Baccarat Rouge 540 in my humble collection of what I consider to be masterpieces.   \nUpdate: I had the honor of meeting Francis Kurkdjian and he graciously signed my bottles...the penmanship was especially nice on Oud Satin Mood!", "1": "Best way I can describe this scent:\nOn the initial spray, like a few other fragrances from FK, I think I\u2019ve made a huge mistake. I\u2019m overwhelmed. A tiny headache is coming on. My eyes water briefly.\nOn the dry down, my opinion starts to change. I keep smelling my arm. Begin to realize that I think if I could find a way to have sex with myself, I would.\nBy hours 2, my entire personality has changed. My husband and I aren\u2019t that serious anyway. \nI still have no idea if I like this fragrance. \nProceed with caution \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d", "2": "I want to start with a warning - this stuff is nuclear. And as I say this I mean eventually if you use this daily on your clothing, there comes a day when you do not have to even put this perfume again, because your clothing is just RADIATING this smell. You open your closet and all you can smell is THIS PERFUME. And, at that moment, if you would put more of this perfume on those clothes, you and people around you definitely won't be able to grasp fresh air, because they will be breathing OUD Satin Mood. And I am not sure if this is good for your health. People... The bottle will last you FOREVER because you need max 2 sprays for a whole 24h. And if this perfume gets on your hair.... good luck with that, because even after washing your hair, you will get hints of this. So I will put an end to this question of longevity and sillage by saying... ETERNAL.\nThe scent itself is gorgeous, more for a late evening or fall/winter season, and in my opinion this scent has to be worn in the darker hours of the day. Definitely not office friendly and not for a casual day. This puts you in the mood. And by saying 'mood' I mean - sensual, a bit erotic but definitely not in a vulgar way, more in this siren-like, hypnotic, and a bit trippy. It creates this mysterious aura around you.\nIt is sweet but there is not even a hint of cheap sweetness. It is a very luxurious scent, very well blended, there are no sharp notes, everything feels smooth, finished, the oud is perfectly complemented by vanilla, personally, I can hardly sense rose notes here, because the vanilla note is more prominent. Here oud perfectly creates this deep, sinking, dark feeling. It is in no way a light cheerful scent. It's extatic, mysterious and very very alluring.", "3": "This one is a Gem. Oud Satin Mood is one of the most beautiful fragrances my nose and brain have ever experienced. Sure, there are similar perfumes on the market; however, I have yet to find one that comes even close to this masterfully blended beauty. I tend to go for the sweeter, fruity, and jammy rose fragrances. Oud Satin Mood is neither. It is a gorgeous, realistic rose; paired with a soft, lightly sweetened vanilla; a luxurious, powdery, smooth-like-satin violet; and, an easy on the nose oud. This fragrance is classy, elegant, sophisticated, and sexy. If Oud Satin Mood were a song; it would be a classic.", "4": "No fragrance has ever blown me away like this one.

You don't know how to describe what it is or what it becomes. It's as ellusive as a dream. It becomes you. Very pleasant, somewhat cozy; it will remind you of who you are.", "1": "I can't understand why people keep saying it has no scent and they could smell almost nothing.  \nOn me, Not a Perfume is so loud that it's impossible to miss.

I'd add \"classy\" - less is more.", "2": "I have tried all of the Escentric Molecules and did not find them to be very exciting or special with little lasting power. I agree that the first thing i thought when i saw this fragrance, i thought they were ripping off Escentric Molecules, but unlike the previous reviewers, this did not upset me as many perfumes smell similar- or near identical. Well this did not! Luckyscent sent me a sample of this and i was not terribly excited to try it but when i did the most beautiful aroma started coming from where i applied it. It is kind of difficult to explain the smell, lightly sweet, musky aroma that somehow smells clean without smelling like soap. For some reason I smell expensive cashmere but my description doesnt do it justice. I didnt notice it at first, but as the night went on it got stronger, warmer and I fell in love with it. It lasted well in to the next day. I am a big fan of JHAG and own lady v and citizen queen-They have the most beautiful packaging too... I would be honored to have this in my collection and I suspect I will eventually cave and buy it...\nI have never smelled anything like this!\nThe fact that its is with out allergens is intriguing... Especially for people in the health care field or who have allergies to regular fragrances.  \nUPDATE \ngot a fb, I knew I would cave! Well, my mom loves it on me but not so much her self (faint on her, almost sweet on me) but my male cousin asked for it for his birthday right after trying it, loving the scent and bottle so much. This is a special scent and chemistry plays a big role. I believe it is totally unisex and pretty long lasting. Much better than eccentric molecules for me, and everyone who's smelled it on me has complimented it and commented it smelled unique, which didn't ever happen with E.M. They are different fragrances but chemistry plays a BIG role on these single molecule fragrances so try before you buy.... \nin my mind this is another fantastic perfume from JHAG, quite possibly my favorite (then lady v, citizen queen which I also own FB of). Lasting power is fantastic as everyone at luckyscent says! I am thrilled with the purchase!", "3": "This is my first review only because this is getting a bad Rep. Please remember, perfumes smell different on everyone. Its subtle enough to wear to my restaurant job but wears for hours.  \nIt boosted my sea appeal to the point random men were complimenting it and my boyfriend growled when I got home from work, with it still on my neck. Its simple but low and almost imperceptible but the primal undertone gets noticed. \nIt has the warm glow of pure desire and will actually make you purr while wearing it. It may be pricey but for over 3 oz (where many domestic only sell up to 2.5) its certainly not the worst I've seen. I will buy the full bottle soon and maybe the little one for my purse.", "4": "Saw it selling for 145.00. Practically fell off my chair when I sniffed this rediculously priced juice that smells like Gain laundry detergent. Someone is having a laugh somewhere while rolling in heaps of money. \n(the next day) On the positive side, it's a day later - after dishwashing and showering - and I can still smell this on my wrist. However, I do use Gain laundry detergent, so maybe I'm just smelling my freshly laundered sweater..."}, "89": {"0": "First of all, I want to start off by saying that this is NOT just Iso E Super and alcohol. All these reviewers saying \"make your own for way cheaper\" have no idea what they're talking about. This actually contains Iso Gamma Super which is not commercially available and is ONLY sold to Escentric Molecules. So although you can create a similar version using Iso E super, it won't be the same as molecule 01 both in smell and performance. Also, if you really do want to make it at home I suggest using timbersilk as that is closer to Iso Gamma Super than Iso E super is. \nAnyway, onto the review. I blind-bought this thinking I was going to be one of the people who didn't smell anything. I knew that a lot of people get OF from it instantly and I bought it because I live in Dubai where the heat goes over 130 F during the summers. I've heard that this is an insane performer in the heat so I ordered a bottle for an amazing price as most fragrances can be found pretty cheap in Dubai. I bought it for $73 and all I can say is wow I'm lucky. Thinking I wasn't gonna be able to smell it, I sprayed it on and was instantly hit with a gorgeous synthetic smell. While I do agree that it smells sort of woody, the scent reminds me a lot of satin for some reason. It's so clean and smooth and intentionally synthetic and overall just a wonderful smell. \nI sprayed this about 3 hours ago and it is still projecting like crazy. The projection is constant and doesn't die down. However, the \"hide and seek\" effect with it is definitely real. I get hit with a sudden strong smell of it every now and then and I absolutely fall in love. I'm pretty sure the hide and seek thing only happens to the wearer and that other people are constantly smelling it as I keep getting complimented by my family members (who usually hate a lot of my fragrances). I also went out in 122 F today for about an hour and I came back and the smell had not faded one single bit.  \nThis is definitely not your typical perfume. Molecule 01 is to your skin what laundry detergent is to clothes. It makes you smell clean and fresh with a really intriguing smell. (Note: I am not comparing the scent to the smell of laundry detergent, it's just an analogy.) Overall, I'm in love with this and I will definitely be rebuying once it runs out.", "1": "As so many reviewers have already described Molecule 01 as more of an effect than a fragrance, I can only add my own experience as testament to the accuracy of this description. \nThe first time I wore Molecole 01, I was only able to detect a very light woody, ambery scent, but judging by the reactions of those around me, this seems to have lasted for hours - and it definitely elicited curiosity and praise from random strangers. \nThanks to suggestions posted on this site and others, I have since successfully made my own version by buying Iso E Super and perfumer's alcohol on eBay and experimenting with different concentrations. Currently I am using a 20% Iso E Super solution, and even after several hours the sillage is incredible - apparently the scent can fill a room, and although it seems not everyone can detect it, those who can seem to react in the most remarkable way. On the train yesterday a woman moved to stand next to me, then leaned forward inhaling deeply (and audibly) with eyes closed and a blissed-out expression on her face, before asking me what I was wearing. \nBelieve the hype about Iso E Super - it is all true. \nShould you wish to experiment the way I did, it is a very cost effective addition to one's perfume wardrobe, and seems to amplify the effects of other fragrances. \nThe single most amazing combination (in terms of effect on others) I have found is to layer it with a beautiful home-made sweet ambergris attar.", "2": "Funny all these reviews about pepper, spice, etc.\nIn my quest for my holy grail, I found a lot of incense or woody fragrance.

What I have discovered is this, Molecule 01 on its own smells beautiful, soft woodsy, gentle spice, faintly musk, like the cleanest sun kissed skin. It comes, it goes, it's intoxicating. When it interacts with one of my \"signature\" fragrances, magic happens. This stuff seems to pick out all the elements of my fragrances which work on my skin and intensify them in waves. I never want to meet a man who's wearing this, for I will be ruined for life. Nothing can match this.", "4": "Alright. I am now a believer. When I first smelled this, all I got was this vague, mere hint of a smell that reminded me of pencil shavings. It didn't smell bad, I even kinda liked it, but couldn't imagine it being very appealing to others around me, if they could even smell it that is, which I thought was unlikely. \nSo I spray on myself. I detect the transparent, woody aroma, which is still subtle to me after spraying it like 15 times. Then I go visit some family, and relatives start saying things like \"What are you wearing? It smells so good!\" Even my brother in law, who never says anything about the colognes I wear. \nFour hours later, I catch up with some friends, and I can't smell a thing at this point, but I ask one of my pals who is also into fragrances if he can smell me and he says he can, that it's quite noticeable but more subtle than a typical cologne. He says it smells great. \nAbout three hours after that, I go to visit my mother for tea. And when she comes within about four feet from me, she asks what I'm wearing and says it smells amazing. \nThis stuff is no joke. Most days, I can only detect it for about the first hour or so, and just barely. But the sillage and projection appear to quite large. And despite the vague, sterile smell to myself, those around the wearer seem to find it extremely attractive. I don't know what to say, except that I once doubted this stuff, but I can't deny results when I experience them first hand."}, "90": {"0": "Smells like you just had a shower, washed and dried your hair, moisturised and sprayed on deodorant.\nHas that fresh musky, clean, powdery, cosmetic smell. \nVery pleasant, would be nice for school or the office.", "1": "I was sniffing perfumes at Nordstrom and the sales associate recommended this one. Wow!  \nAs someone who rarely experiences love at first sniff, I was mesmerized! I immediately knew I had to have it. \nI would describe Signature as a solar gourmand - it is creamy, citric, floral, and vanilla!  \nIt reminds me of being wrapped in a white, fuzzy blanket in a garden full of clementine and florals.

A little...tropical. But I would not consider this a typical tropical perfume. \nWhen I first sprayed this, I got this beautiful vanilla ice cream fragrance floating around me. Light and pretty. Beautiful! I let it settle on my skin for a few seconds, and then took a deep sniff, nose to skin. What I smelled was... clementine. A wonderful bright fresh citrus. So lovely! So surprising!  \nIn the middle, when this settles, the sweet vanilla ice cream scent comes through, but the clementine is still there. This is my favorite part, because it reminds me of a Creamsicle. I love that citrus orange vanilla musk combo. Just incredible. Then I get the magnolia and ylang ylang, which gives it a hint of a coconutty smell. Just a hint.  \nIn the drydown it smells more of a light ylang ylang vanilla musk. Clean, sweet, and fresh.  \nThis did not last long on my skin, but it lasted great in my hair and on my clothes. I get pretty good projection too. It's not strong enough to knock a co-worker down, but I do gets hints of it around me as I am working. Makes me happy.  \nMakes me so happy.", "4": "This fragrance is like floating on a fluffy cloud or a hug from your favorite person. It\u2019s a soft and creamy dream.

As mentioned its very lemony and sweet but there is a very elegant almost woodiness to it that makes it very masculine. I think mature men and younger guys would enjoy this one. Perfect for hot weather and when you want something fresh and light. You can apply this one liberally without bothering co workers, and I feel it is good for day or night.

It's straightforward and not the most cerebral fragrance, but sometimes that's nice. For $60, I would buy this. For $200+? Oh, no no no. Too simple to demand that amount of money. You have to be joking.", "1": "I went out on a mission to find a \u201crefined coconut summer fragrance\u201d for my woman, at her request, since she \u201ctrusts my nose\u201d..so after a filter search here on fragrantica, I visited my familiar Tom Ford sales assistant in order to sample both soleil blancs as I already suppose, based on olfactory memory and her preferences on fragrances, that the usual suspect virgin island water is not something she would opt for..so this comparing review is based on single wear on me and take that into account before you decide for yourselves. Also take into account that the testing was done on a 26 degrees Celsius day.. \nEau de soleil blanc starts with citrus before transitioning to a coconut creamy white floral fragrance.\nSoleil blanc on the other hand lacks this citrus, has a beautiful modest almond feeling(maybe the pistachio listed here?)\nProjection was better on eau de soleil without that meaning that it was not decent from the soleil blanc. I got constant whafs from both my arms throughout the day. \nI cannot comment on silage of both as it was a single spot spray\u2014single wear but the one I eventually bought for my woman has great silage!\nLongevity at least 8 hours (on the 8 hour mark I showered) with the soleil blanc persisting on my skin even after showering for what it\u2019s worth. \nNote here that despite the \u201ceau\u201d in the name of the bottle of one, they are both edp concentrations. \nI understand that to the average nose out there, and let\u2019s face it, this is the vast majority of your encounters, this fragrance will give the impression of suntan lotion. But to be honest it is not. It is a luxury feeling coconut note, creamy, milky if I may say, almost gourmand, relaxing, dancing beautifully with pistachio especially in the soleil blanc bottle.  \nMain differences between the two? \nThe \u201csand\u201d feeling (I do not know which note in the perfume emits this vibe but it is certainly there) is to me present in the eau de soleil blanc only and it is absent from the soleil blanc variant. It gives you the impression that you get the smell of thin light brown sand, warmed after being exposed to the sun, on your skin.  \nAnother difference is the fact that the citruses are more present throughout the lifespan of the eau de soleil blanc, prominent in the opening and taking a backstage in the drydown.This citrus presence is not easily detectable in the drydown of soleil blanc, which in turn is to me a better blend in total. \nMasculine or feminine? \nAnd in order to address the elephant in the room, are they both more masculine or feminine? Before I write down my opinion, it is interesting to tell you this: when I went to the sales assistant, who knows my preferences rather well by now, from a lot of previous encounters, and asked to sample those fragrances, her first response was \u201cI do not believe this is something you would wear..those two scents might be rather feminine leaning for your taste\u201d. Now before you judge her comment, I personally understand where it comes from, taking into account her preconceived notion about me based on my past purchases and I love that about her because this is truly a personalized and customized service from an employee who loves her job. She also went on to explain that the customer demographic of those two as far as sales go, is mostly women. To be clear fragrances have no genders and I do not judge people by what they like to smell. Based on note breakdown one would guess that maybe the presence of citruses in eau de soleil blanc is something that could make this more \u201ceasy\u201d for a man to wear it and that is understandable. Maybe the eau de soleil is the fragrance of the two that men would prefer because of those citruses alone, creating a more airy feeling.  \nFor me, the only scenario I would wear any of them would be while on the beach, while on vacation and the one I would opt for believe it or not is the soleil blanc. It is more elegant than its sibling to my nose and if you decide to go down the road of coconut then rock it all the way. I truly believe that this fragrance, on a self assured man, relaxing on the beach, would be spot on and somewhat different from all the usual citrus smelling scents out there. And if you are in your 30s (I am older!) it may attract for you some new encounters because women like this scent! Now smelling this on a man in a dinner restaurant scenario for example, may feel at least to me somewhat out of place. Instead smelling this on a woman, especially in summer, regardless of the scenario makes me think that she is a woman of taste and elegance. \nFinal thoughts: \nMy woman fell in love with it when I bought it for her..She wore it a lot in summer..I loved smelling it on her..I think she smells elegant,sexy,alluring wearing this scent..Her, in a summer dress, warm breeze giving me whafs of this from her, makes me literally craving to go d@wn on her..this scent on her, this creamy almond feeling pistachio, white floral, coconut combination is truly an invisible magnet.. \nIs it versatile? For a woman yes, for a man maybe not so much. The only scenario I could rock this is while on the beach and I may even enjoy it like Virgin Island Water, the fragrance I usually opt for when I am on summer vacation. \nBut by now the smell of soleil blanc to my mind is already an olfactory representation of her, elegantly dressed in white, in the summer night, smiling at me with her black piercing eyes.. \nIs it year round? No..except if one wants to take an olfactory trip while at home, during a winter day, anticipating summer holidays perhaps? \nIs it signature worthy?No..even for a woman I cannot picture this as a signature everyday scent..I truly don\u2019t know why.. \nIs it worth the price asked? Eventually it is not a versatile all year round fragrance and under this scope for some it may not worth the price. But for the scenarios that this fragrance fits, the quality of this scent for me justifies the price. \nTrust only your nose..it was a single wear for me, but I experienced it enough on my significant half throughout last summer.. \nSmell nice and smile!!", "2": "How does this smell like? Like summer in Greece. Don't judge it immediately after spraying it, let it dry for at least 30' and then...it smells like a feeling. \nNo, I don't have anything to win from TF, mostly from Private Collection that is so expensive (70% not worthy) but, this perfume is a success story. You wake up in a Greek island, morning sea breeze awakens your soul, bright sun gives you the need to go to the beach. You apply cream suntan lotion, no matter how 'glamorous' or not. After your sunbathing, your skin is sunkissed and treated with sea's salt. This is exactly what Soleil Blanc reminds me of. This thing must be experienced to get my point. The only notes that can clearly detect are: Cardamom, TF's tuberose, a touch of amber & benzoin and a whisper of real coconut/pistachio leaves.", "3": "I live an oxymoron. I've only been on a beach ... one time, in nearly 40 years of life. I prefer my urban dwelling that is surrounded by the Smoky Mountains. But, give me a tropical, coconut cologne and I suddenly become a beach bum on my balcony overlooking non-stop traffic. Maybe that's one of the best parts about fragrances? I'm stuck where I'm at for awhile and these beachy scents let me get away ... sort of. Most of the problems others have noted with this Tom Ford are not happening to me. I have a very nice, somewhat sweet coconut with some light florals floating around behind it. I don't know if I would buy a full bottle but I find scents like these are worth buying a 1.7 of or if you have a trusted decanter to sell you a 20-30 ml decant of. I'm kind of stuck on whether I like this or Creed's Virgin Island Water better. I do think the VIW is more masculine than the Soleil Blanc but both are now in my spring/summer rotation. Check back in September, I'll be all out of these two and the heat of the summer will have me begging for cold weather and I'll be swearing off coconuts for good. It's a cycle, you should try it.", "4": "THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! It smells exactly like suntan lotion, straight up. Sexy! Sultry! Only critique is that it lacks longevity. Although I love it and it smells like summer at the (nude) beach, I would not actually wear this to the beach (yes I wear perfume at the beach). I think the scent of Soleil Blanc puts me in a longing state. I will wear it in the heat of the city or at the park with the family when I am *wishing* I was at the beach.

If this was a niche frag or a Tom Ford, you frag snobs would be all over it. Granted, the bottle is tacky but the name is fitting. Guys my age feel like their worth a million bucks when girls lean in close because we smell awesome. No other frag in my 60+ bottle collection has garnered as much attention and compliments as 1 Million. I've had women of all ages compliment me in public. Women I didn't know who went out of their way to compliment this frag. That's a major quality many frags can't boast.  \nSome of the reviews were saying 1 Million was too young etc. Sure, but on the flip side there are frags out there that are too mature. Fragrances CAN'T always appeal to every demographic. Just because you're 50 and this frag is \"too young\" for you DOES NOT make it a bad scent.  \nI understand no fragrance will please everyone. It's just myself and many other reviewers are tired of the \"frag snobery\" that infiltrates reviews. Like I said, if this was not popular, was a niche brand or something along the lines of TF it'd have much better reviews. Out of 85% of new market offerings, how many really stack up to 1 Million's mass appeal & cost/performance ratio?", "1": "My brother passed away 2 years ago and this was his signature scent, everyone complimented him. I love the smell of this and I wear it to remember him and what he smelled like. Imagine your driving around looking at gorgeous Christmas lights mid December the heating on full but the front window down blowing cold air on your face. Everyone in that car is happy and smiling. This scent is a warm hug on a cold day. I may be biased but this is a 10/10 fragrance.", "2": "All the hate towards one million is unbelievable.\nCalling it a fragrance for douchebags and attack people who wear this instead of talking about the fragrance itself, It seems people like to hate on popular things. Calling one million a generic fragrance while this was The fragrance who started the trend of this whole sweet and sexy clubbing fragrances for men.\nAnyways, one million for me is not just an Ok fragrance, It's an amazing scent with unbelievable performance and longevity, no other designer fragrance can compete with it in terms of performance, Even some oud based niche fragrances. And all reformulation talk here is total BS. New versions still last easy 14 hours plus on my skin. \nI think it's worth to buy one million cause now days it's not popular like it used to and many people still don't know the smell and even if they do, they still love it.\nBtw, F*** jeremy fragrance.", "3": "I don't care how popular it is. How unpopular it is. If everyone is wearing it. If nobody is wearing it. If it's strong. If it's weak. When I find a fragrance that I love and suits me, I wear it and I love it. I don't care what anyone says or thinks. And this one is a definate LOVE. I am almost done my 100ml bottle and I am a woman ... and I will definately repurchase. Can't stop sniffing my wrist. LOVIN it! <3", "4": "Bashing this one has become a lame trend and I do not approve of that, what we have here is a loud clubbing scent that has worked as a blueprint for many successful modern blends. The fabled bubblegum vibe might be a bit off-putting due to the market saturation but there is a lot more going on here than that. The opening is akin to the special kicks performed by Van Damme during his heyday - juicy mode engaged!! The performance is excellent and the base notes that support this fragrance surprise you with their richness. A bit pass\u00e9 you might say but real classics stand the test of time. \nSuch idiotic controversy!!"}, "94": {"0": "Pure Poison is classy and timeless. My mom can pull this off, I can pull this off (I'm 24) and my 92 year old neighbour can pull it off. It's a floral with some mild fruitiness to it. It also has a certain \"wetness\" or \"creaminess\" to it which I really love. Can be worn year round, the scent get's beautifully amped up in summer heat but also smells amazing in colder weather. \nThis perfume is so unique to me, it's one of my absolute favorites and nothing compares to it. To me this is the best fragrance Dior ever made. I get complimented a lot when wearing it, so it's certainly a crowdpleaser, but certainly is unique. No one ever told me \"ugggh, is that Pure Poison you're wearing?\" It's mysteriously-smelling, I love it.\nI mainly detect creamy gardenia, some jasmine and orange blossom but those two are more shy to my nose and nicely balanced. I detect no wood, to me it's not a woody perfume.", "1": "My husband decided to go out on a limb and buy me a bottle of this for Christmas last year. He's not usually the type to buy something so personal without taking me with him and I could tell when I unwrapped it he was very nervous about my reaction. I wasn't wearing any perfume that morning so I indulged him and sprayed a little on. He didn't say anything just smiled and as the day went on and we had a house full of family, he would come over now and them touch my back or kiss my cheek. I received a number of compliments and was quite pleased, it was usually after giving a hug to someone that they would say how nice my perfume was. At the end of the evening and everyone had gone home, my honey turned to me, gathered me in his arms and said, \"Your beautiful and your perfume is driving me crazy!\"....enough said, onto bottle number 2!!", "2": "Pure Poison is (excuse my language here) sex in a bottle. \nIt is the very essence of a beautiful, alluring, confident woman. It is the scent that turns heads and brings people closer to you - ladies, this is as close to a love potion as you'll get!  \nDo NOT wear this perfume if you do not wish to be noticed in a room, it's called pure poison for a reason! The jasmine alone is enough to mesmerize you but the orange blosson and sandalwood will leave you feeling like a siren. \nIt has the right amount of longevity and the perfect sillage, not too much and not too little, which I find is rare in all the new perfumes coming out. \nThis one is definitely a signature scent and very hard to give up!", "3": "When I smell \"Pure poison\" I instantly have a image of \"White Queen\" who is fresh, clean, cold, gorgeous, elegant, powerful and very highly sexy. I always wear this perfume when I have a business or formal occasion because it help me to get more confidence.  \nBesides, the sillage and longevity is very long, more than 10 hr for my skin. (excellent!!!) \nPure poison you are perfect!!! and I really love you.!!!!!", "4": "Strange, witchy white floral. Odd and slightly macabre somehow, like the witch from the Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe maybe. It's like a snowy tundra, beautiful, bright white, untouched and very, very cold. It's not a kind perfume, no warmth, its heart is icy and unyielding. It rules with a fist of silver plated iron. \nWhy does this review sound like an opium dream? I have no idea, point is, it lives up to its name. \nDefinitely getting a bottle."}, "95": {"0": "Jeremy fragrance doesn't have a clue what he is talking about, he said don't buy prada black In his video recently and showed us dior sauvage as a replacement. I used to like him but all he does now is promoting his own brand.\nAnyways, This frgrance is an absolutely beautiful creation, It's a compliment magnet, I'm waiting for fall to wear this juice. I got several girls telling me how good I smell with prada luna rossa black. Prada luna rossa sport is already amazing fragrance, Imagine making it darker, deeper and sexier, that's what you get with this thing.\nReally good fragrance for fall and winter time on for date nights or night outs.", "1": "Prada black smells sooo good. Smooth,fresh,soft,inviting,and different from what most guys are wearing.If you have a bunch of blue fragrances and want something different but will still work well in every situation then pick this one.", "2": "Absolutely divine smell. Smells like a dark soapy Play-Doh. I want to stick my dick in it.  \nEdit after 6 mths: Projection is pretty weak, longevity not bad.", "3": "Criminally underrated date night fragrance. When you get tired of wearing The One or La Nuit, this is a great alternative to change it up with. Superior longevity to both and projects decently. It smells soft, powdery, and of course the amber. \nIt's easy to like, and just puts me at ease.", "4": "Being a big fan of oriental fragrances, I really felt the need to review this. I loved Luna Rossa Extreme and even got a couple of back up bottles, just in case it got discontinued, which it did. In my opinion, Luna Rossa Black is even better. The scent is oh so beautiful! Longevity is good and sillage is acceptable (especially with strict IFRA regulations). At first, I wasn't a fan of the opening, but loved the dry down. Now, I love all of it. Nice, dark, elegant tonka reminiscent of Midnight in Paris. The dry down reminds me of a better, more modern La Nuit. This is probably the best fragrance release of 2018 and I'm so happy I can own it. \nScent: 9/10\nLongevity: 9/10\nProjection: 6/10\nPrice: 7/10"}, "96": {"0": "Don't listen to the women in the reviews below. There's absolutely nothing feminine, let alone unisex about this scent. I swear, women in fragcom would argue that John Varvatos' Dark Rebel is a feminine or unisex scent if they find it appealing. This scent may be too masculine for some men even, as it has a nod to the \"old school\" influences of male perfumery while still remaining modern. If you're a woman who likes this, it's not that it's feminine or unisex, but rather you just have taste that deviates from the norm. Nothing wrong with having deviant taste, just please stop misleading people who haven't tried this scent yet.", "1": "I can understand people saying it reminds them of Spicebomb. It's along the same line. However, MiB is less sweet, less 'easy' and therefore more sophisticated, in my opinion. I love to wear this myself, but I love it on a man as well. I think it's quite unisex, very feminine on a woman and very masculine on a man. Anyone wearing it with confidence and style would be able to pull this off. Very good one from Bvlgari; touch\u00e9.", "2": "I can\u2019t really say anything more than what has already been said but I do want to mention how great I think this scent is\u2026. I\u2019m a big fan of Spicebomb, Pulse of the Night, Herod, Oajan, Habdan, Carlisle, Blessed Baraka, Side Effect, Rehab, Dior Homme Intense, Guerlain L\u2019homme Ideal EDP, Philipp Plein No Limits, and this fits right in there with them, I pick up on similarities between each one. \nThe opening is just magnificent, I really enjoy it. I get a nice big blast of warm spices, rum and a clean tobacco leaf with a waxy, leathery undertone. Within moments the powdery iris and a slightly indolic tuberose show up, which I just love, adding a very pleasant floral nature to the mix while retaining its sensuality and masculinity. The base of tonka, guaiac wood and benzoin perfectly compliments the rest of the composition, leaving you with a slightly sweet, creamy, earthy, leathery, gentlemanly and seductive aura.  \nI get average performance from my more recent batch, I\u2019d say around 6-7 hours. Spraying my clothes might stretch it an extra hour or so but it\u2019s still not crazy strong, which to some might be a good thing. I feel this is a more refined, mature take in comparison to Spicebomb, so if you feel that\u2019s a bit too sweet and youthful, or even aggressive, Man In Black is different enough and at its price point it\u2019s certainly worth looking in to.  \nGreat for business professionals or more rugged individuals who don\u2019t want something too fresh and sporty, yet enjoy more traditional scents, maybe even classic fougere\u2019s but want something more modern, sexy and alluring. This is better suited for the colder months. Perfect for fall and winter, day and night.  \nAll in all, this has been brilliantly executed at the hands of master perfumer Alberto Morillas and one he should be very proud of. \nPs. The sprayers for these bottles can be kind of finicky\u2026 they\u2019ll either provide a nice even distribution if pressed down more aggressively, or shoot out across the room like a jet stream if pressed down slow and gently. There\u2019s really no in between.", "3": "Much more refined than Spicebomb.... a spicy, leathery the light. Perfect for cool weather night out or intimate encounter, oozes class and confidence. An alpha male scent.", "4": "Got this recently as an early Christmas gift, and I must say I'm amazed!\nDespite fragrantica stating this is warm spicy, I find this to be the definition of FRESH/SOFT SPICY. \nIt's really amazing to have a man's fragrance with so much creamy tuberose, and that soft animalic leather vibe fits in perfectly.Even doe it's not listed, I detect a lot of nutmeg and cinnamon, which makes it perfect for winter!\nThe dry down is unexpected, kind of powdery-woody, which I love.This FEELS black, I don't get warmth, which is interesting, because the notes seem fiery, especially that vanilla sweetish atmosphere it creates. I love it anyways, the fact that it's a little cold-ISH(maybe from tonka bean)\nis intriguing and unexpected.Just my opinion. \nThe smell is really alluring,almost sexual I might say, but not necessarily Noir. \nWhen it comes to longevity, on me, this lasts all day, just like Thierry Mugler's A*Men, which is actually what I'm looking for. Also, sillage is HUGE, not medium at all, as the site says. \nI give this 9 out of 10, JUST because the Spritzer is the dumbest I've ever seen, I can't cope with that bullshit...such a beautiful, heavy bottle, that spray ruins everything, it's practically urinating perfume instead of spraying it."}, "97": {"0": "DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!!  \nAmazing fragrance. Best of the lineup. It will make the rest of your collection obsolete.

You can begin to hate when I say this scent is completely different from the other 2 fragrances in the line. This is much more zesty/woody/fresh. The first time I used my bottle, I thought there was longevity problems, this made me upset. Then my employee bought a bottle after smelling mine. This changed my opinion. After whitnessing someone else wear this every day, I can say this stuff has beast-mode longevity and sillage. I was surprised to say the least in regards to how strong the performance was. SUPER high quality. It\u2019s by far my favorite of the line without comparison.  \nAlso, forget what Jeremy Fragrance and the others says are panty-dropping scents. I have news for you, if you\u2019re out trying to find the fragrance that will make girls like you, there\u2019s more needed than a fragrance to fix your problem. Just saying. You should buy fragrances because they bring out a certain feeling or emotion, because they make you feel bettter and enjoy the finer things in life!", "2": "The whole 'Blue' fragrance race is now finished \nThis Won", "3": "This fragrance is great, a darker/deeper/stronger version of the EDP.

I would wait until you finish the EDP (unless money is no object), it is redundant in that regard.  \nDoes not project as much due to less alcohol content, but is very noticeable 2-3 feet away. Overall pleased with the fragrance. As expected. Lives up to the parfum quality!", "4": "This stuff is incredible.  \nThe original was sickly sweet and headache inducing - much too synthetic.  \nIn this Parfum version, they took out the sweet, synthetic mess along with the incense and made it into this masterpiece! \nThe smell is gorgeous. A heavy dose of bitter lemon with tons of sandalwood and a healthy dose of cedar. WOW.  \nScent = 10/10.  \nI REALLLYYYY hope the performance is better than what I have been seeing. It would be a giant shame if this did not perform well.  \nI am now a fan again of the BdC."}, "98": {"0": "This is a chewy, sweet caramel with a little bit of naughty saltiness and barely detectable flowers and sandalwood.

It's right up my alley, warm, sweet, fluffy and flirty. I am so happy it doesn't smell like a sunscreen. I'm tired of coconut, tiare and plumeria.\nI love the combination of notes in it, and I imagine pistachio and caramel ice cream melting in the sun, giving you that really sweet, sticky scent.", "2": "Okay, honestly I sprayed this on and was not expecting much because it is just a body spray, however I am amazed to say......this spray smells so good that it has drawn compliments that have boggled my mind! I am a Chanel Coco Noir gal, and for gourmand, I like Hildi Soliani\u2019s Crema di Latte which also amazingly draws compliments and smells like cake. Anyhow, I think smelling like pistachio/almond must be very sexy because it grabs people\u2019s attention, and I can honestly say, when combined with the shower cream and bum bum cream, lasts all day so you don\u2019t need perfume or anything stronger. Plus, the price point is great. \nThere is a pineapple note in this, that is not listed (at least in the cream) that adds interest as well and sweetness, but not too much which is good because I don\u2019t like overly sweet scents - this is more aromatic than sweet.  \nI wore this to work in the winter and the guys wanted to talk to me more than usual and hang out, and the gals appreciate the scent also. I would say value-wise, this is a hit and It smells amazing..even in winter which takes on a more Tobacco vibe. This is definitely worth trying and earns its high rating easily. Again, I am amazed.", "3": "This is a very good replacement for Laura Merciers Creme De Pistache.", "4": "Straight up caramel pistachio! I love this and I feel like it suits most people. Very sweet but not sickly headache sweet like I know the other two Sol de Janeiro scents can be for some people. Lasts very long on my skin, maybe 5 hours wich I think is long for a body mist. Women at my work has asked me what perfume i\u00b4m wearing when I have worn this. I have all SOL DE JANEIRO scents and the difference is: \nCheriosa 71: Sweetest of them all, an autumn/winter scent. White chocolate cookie. \nBrazilian crush: Suits most people. Lighter than Cheriosa 71 and Coco Cabana. Smells exactly like the bum bum cream, straight up caramel pistachio. Summer/spring scent. \nCoco cabana: Sweeter than Brazilian crush. Coconutty marshmallows with a hint of buttered popcorn. Also a summer/spring scent."}, "99": {"0": "I love casual and down-to-earth scents which convey feeling of being outdoors, but many of them are so harsh and chemical. Gypsy Water is such a beautiful exception in this category. The scent is a natural, soft and creamy combination of woods and vanilla spiked with ever-green needles and juniper berries. It has a perfect balance of being casual but not boring, linear but not simple. Gypsy Water is my jeans and sweater companion to cuddle with on cold November nights. Lovely, easy to wear and natural, I could never go wrong wearing this scent.  \nThe lemon and bergamot opening makes me think of a windy day outdoors \u2013 refreshing and natural. Yet, right away, the warm rays of sandalwood and vanilla shine through the scent making it soft and comforting. The iris adds just a touch of powder and pine-tree and juniper berries keep the composition winter fresh. The scent has a bit of a linear quality but it does not bother me at all, as the composition is absolutely lovely. It is a soft scent, which makes it a great every day casual scent. And though it is quite light, it does lasts for hours.  \nGypsy Water is not the scent that will shock you with its super complex composition or fireworks of notes. But it is a scent that I will take with me on a winter skiing trip, a walk in the park or everyday at work. It was such a pleasure to wear that I finished my sample in no time and now craving for the full bottle. Overall score is 8.5/10", "1": "Love the smell of this fragrance. This is my second favourite Byredo, after bal d afrique. However absolutely agree about the lasting power of 10 min at most. May be the most sensitive noses can wear this fragrance... Even though I do prefer very soft fragrances that stay close to the skin, this one leaves some doubts, especially considering the price tag. \nDo try it before you invest. \nUpdate:\nI felt obliged to update my comment. As i was not fair in it. Yes, this fragrance has actually swept me away, replacing my signature scent of many years (caleche eau delicate). I was comparing it to serge lutens , amouage, montale perfumes when I said the scent does not last. The lasting power is actually quite long on me, not as bright as at first, but keeps well 12h. The scent does not change much over time, what makes it enjoyable from the start from as long as it lasts.\nNow, bal d afrique is the one that fades away quickly and does not rerun even as a hint. I bought both of the perfumes, love them both. But gypsy water is always winning over bal d afrique each time I reach for a perfume bottle.  \nEndlessly beautiful!", "2": "This is my very favourite perfume at the moment. I've wanted to buy it for a year but still haven't. I think the reason may be that if I ever feel a bit down, I just go to the perfume shop and try it on, sniff it, and instantly feel better. \nAnother reason is that it's quite expensive, and I'm afraid it doesn't last long enough on the skin to justify the price tag.\nBut I love, love, love the soft mix of powder, incense and vanilla. Big love.\nGypsy Water is an unusual perfume, nothing like those from the big designer brands. Speaking of which, I think that the reason Byredo is my favourite perfume-brand at the moment is just that, their perfumes are quite different and often surprising. Not always nice on my skin, but never boring.", "3": "Of all the Byredo scents I've tried, Gypsy Water has to be my favourite after Bal d'Afrique. It opens fresh and aromatic, with a soft lemon note bolstered by juniper and pine. The aromatic notes don't so much fade as blend into the smooth oriental dry down, which is all about vanilla and creamy sandalwood. The vanilla here isn't overly sweet - it's more like the subtle wood-and-smoke-faceted vanilla of Diptyque's Eau Duelle. The sandalwood is austere and smooth, again bringing to mind a Diptyque scent - in this case, Tam Dao. It's more complex and multifaceted than both those scents, however.  \nUnlike others, I don't have any issues with longevity, but sillage is low. Those looking for greater tenacity should consider Arquiste's Architects Club, which shares many notes including vanilla, sandalwood, amber and juniper. The Arquiste scent, released six years' later, lasts longer and has a similar vibe. Personally, I prefer Gypsy Water - it's better blended and has more of a progression. Wonderful stuff.", "4": "Gypsy water reminds me of a church and the smell you get when you have a nice lady with citrusy perfume next to you and it mixes with the strong incense and woody notes from old benches. There is a path of lemon through this perfume that feels very natural\u2026if you are into exploration of compositions lightly touched with lemon zest.

I haven't tried Ganymede this far, so here is a more levelheaded review. \nThe main raw material here is one of Givaudan's 'augmented' naturals, Akigalawood, derived from patchouli, yet not really smelling like patchouli, because characteristic terpenes and other compounds have been removed , so you are left with a very clean, fresh spicy and in a way 'see-through' woodiness. It's hard to place, somewhere between a very clean woody vetiver and a fresh and resinous cedar, but without any pencil shaving vibes at all.\nThe opening is a mixture of a mildly limey/lemony fresh spicy, peppery, gingery mix with a discrete sweetness, adding up to a half ginger ale half sprite accord. There are also fresh herbal nuances, with more basil cutting through on paper rather than skin, I mostly get a gingery vibe on skin. The dominant dry woodiness mixes with these tart-sweet and fresh spicy facets together resembling a sweet lemony but also dry gingery gin cocktail, but without any overt boozy characteristics. I also get a touch of a dry floral nuance, another layer of freshness and depth. \nMasculine-leaning, radiant and fresh, inoffensive, sits right between a fresh herbal aromatic and fragrant woody territory with an interesting sweetness to it. Very modern, clean, radiant and fresh, yet extremely stable and tenacious. Recommended to those that don't generally gravitate towards overtly woody scents (like myself), this represents a modern approach to woody freshness that didn't really exist up to a few years ago.", "2": "Brilliant, intoxicating woods, vetiver, some citrus, some spice but mostly aromatic woods.

See indicated* for review of scent itself. \nAs I recover from the loss of a nine year relationship, one of the things I find takes my mind off things is trying new fragrances. It\u2019s therapeutic: as any expert will tell you mindfulness involves engaging your senses and what better way to do so for a \u201cfraghead\u201d than by trying new scents? Now, I will admit, part of my quest has involved searching for a \u201cman-magnet\u201d perfume that makes me feel desirable again and will turn heads when I decide the time is right to get back on the dating scene. Where does Prada Candy come into play? I\u2019ll tell you. \nNow going by what I have read online, from past experiences and deducing from the science of scent in sexual attraction that men are drawn to gourmand compositions and musk, I figured Candy would be a sure fire contender for making the right impression. In that respect, this scent has proved disappointing. No compliments from the opposite sex, nothing carnal by my own interpretation, no feelings of being back on top form. This is not my magic seduction potion. However\u2026 \nWhat Candy is, is comfort. It\u2019s a stroke of the hair. It\u2019s a hug from your best friend. It\u2019s a chai latte to snuggle into bed with as you hide away in your bed and let yourself feel the hurt you\u2019ve bottled up all day at the office under your veneer of the strong woman who won\u2019t let something as irrational as her love life affect her career in contract law one iota.  \n*I approached Candy expecting a potent, sugary nostrilful of caramel flirtiness and mouthwatering seduction. What I was met with was a blanket of powdered benzoin, elegantly underscored by the sort of upmarket caramel you would find in a boozy desert in a boutique restaurant as opposed to say, coating the biscuit layer of a Twix. True to Prada's signature, it shares many qualities with other scents in the brand's repertoire, that unmistakable powdery blend found in the Infusions line and may be a safe blind buy for fans. Its sillage is close and personal. Only the two women I was in within a foot\u2019s proximity of could smell it. But they loved it. \u201cYou smell lovely! What are you wearing today Lizzy?\u201d So it\u2019s a girl\u2019s scent for girls huh? Well, that\u2019s great! \nYou know what, I\u2019ve never been a fan of gourmands. Give me vetiver, patchouli, white flowers, leather and woods any day. What I found here was a scent that suits my chemistry, lifts my mood and makes me feel at ease with myself and is just the right amount of sweet for me. Perhaps this fragrance is a lesson in being yourself. But as I\u2019m not my usual, logic-and-facts driven self right now, I shall continue my search for my take-me-to-bed scent. Prada Candy is not my date night fragrance but it is now my \u201ceverything\u2019s going to be okay\u201d fragrance. I bought a full bottle.", "1": "When I first heard about Prada Candy I was completely turned off by the name. It sounds like a Paris Hilton or Britney Spears scent, and my spontaneous thought was simply \"dang, a sellout.. I feel sorry for you Prada\". \nFor some reason I got my ass over to the perfume shelves in the store and tried that Hilton sellout on, and oh heavens! It didn't take long before I changed my mind completely. Prada Candy is one of those scents that I've been longing for without knowing that they existed. A mellow, grown up gourmand with dignity. And the fact that you recognize Infusion d'Iris in it makes it even better. I like Id'I, but there's something with it I can't stand on my skin. Candy picked the golden parts of Id'I up and chucked it into a warm irresistible gourmand blend. Could it get any better? \nI understand why many people dislike it though, the simplicity of this scent makes it a hit or miss. Either you like it or you don't. Also my skin tend to pick gourmand notes up very easily and never let go of them, so on me it smells delicious for hours and hours, even though it's quite close to the skin. The sheerness of it might be a problem if it doesn't fit like a puzzle piece with your skin. \nMy boyfriend has asked me about five times since the day before yesterday what I'm wearing, because I smell unusually good.

Composed by Maurice Roucel as an \u201cact of seduction and generosity\u201d, Musc Ravageur is an uncompromising Oriental, which trumps current fads. Its explosive departure of bergamot, tangerine and cinnamon is set against a backdrop of vanilla, musk and amber. A sexy, turbulent perfume, in one word: ravageur.\" \nI can't tell you how much I enjoy reading the superfluous, often false marketing that perfumers and brands come up with to describe their fragrances. Partly because I too, am afflicted with the same disease of verbose nonsense, and in part because they're often wildly off base, and a less evolved part of my being enjoys laughing at them in secret. However this time, it is all too accurate. Abstractly, perhaps. But accurate nonetheless.  \nMusc Ravageur is an incredibly difficult fragrance to describe. It is deceptive, and takes great pleasure in tormenting me, and every time I think I've got a grasp on it, something throws me for a loop. Is it frustrating? Hardly. No, the experience is very much enjoyable, like trying to catch a glimpse of something mythical and fleeting. \nMusc Ravageur is incredibly simple, yet infinitely complex, and it is within the nuances and depth, that Musc Ravageur truly shines and displays itself as it is. And it needs a great deal of observation to truly appreciate it in it's entirety. One needs to smell and smell again (hardly a difficult task) to find the bite of cinnamon, the heat of cloves and the deliciously edible vanilla, but the impression, by and large, communicates a delicate mirage of soft skin, silken sheets, cashmere blankets, hushed whispers, and low lighting. It is sensual almost to the point of debauchery. It is warm, inviting, criminally seductive, almost like (and please pardon my bluntness) an erotic novel unfolding on the skin. Truth be told, if Casanova had a fragrance, this would be it. \nOnto the fragrance itself, in slightly more detail, before my train of thought drags me further off track.  \nThe fragrance opens with a blast of citrus and spice, in the strangest manner. It can't be described as fresh, it can't be described as spicy. The opening is fleeting, but it sets the tone for this (admittedly bottom heavy) fragrance in the perfect way. It is difficult, if not impossible, to explain how this is the case, but it is. They come, they tease, and then they disappear, giving way very quickly to the cinnamon and clove in a beautiful symphony of warmth. And just as the spices truly begin to bloom, they're joined by musks, vanilla, woods and amber.  \nAnd here, in the \"base\" is where Musc Ravageur truly becomes the legend it is known far and wide as. Every note mingling in perfect harmony, becoming something that transcends \"just perfumery\" and becomes art in earnest. The spices, the deep amber, the sweet vanilla, the warm musk, makes for a blend that defies all description. \nThe vanilla is sweet, almost like ice cream, and would perhaps be too much by itself. But the dark, almost bitter woods balance it, lending a bite to the base, even as the amber adds depth and gives the impression of a golden twilight on supple skin. And supple skin is truly what shines through as the light dusting of musk makes it's way through the blend, trickling through, almost ghostly in it's prominence. And the musk itself, while hardly animalic, is far from neutral, just raw enough to pay homage to it's name.  \nThe dark, velvety cloak of seduction that one dons when they wear Musc Ravageur is truly dangerous, to others, and to the self. It smells unapologetically of carnality, and unmistakably of sophistication, and in doing so toes many lines, between prim and debauche, between soft and loud, between innocence and sin, and between mortal and the divine.  \nThere is nothing quite like this, to my nose. And I seldom wear it, not for lack of want, but for fear of being enslaved by it's soft whispers. I have rarely, if ever, called a fragrance flawless. But to me, Musc Ravageur is just that. True perfection.", "3": "Musc Ravageur is one of the best composition by Maurice Roucel and an incredibly compelling, sort of animalic, musc with a gourmandic twist.

It's that kind of excited sickness one might feel when seeking out seedy anonymous sex on a hot humid summer night in the Deep South - I've said too much.

The company was very successful in the creation of the fragrance, the name and the bottle chosen to involve this explosive liquid. \nSpicebomb is composed by notes of bergamot, grapefruit and elemi resin, in the output; Saffron, chilli pepper and cinnamon, in the heart; tobacco, leather and a touch of vetiver, in the base. Not even the official website mentions the presence of lavender or lemon, as I've seen in some websites, including, in descriptions of stores. \nFor those who don't know, Elemi is a tropical tree (Canarium Luzonicum) which is native from the Philippines and Moluccas Islands, from which a natural gum is extracted, then is distilled to produce its essential oil. It has nuances very close to incense, but also can present green and aromatic tones of coriander. \nRegarding the fragrance, it is sweet from the moment it touches the skin. There is, initially, a fruity and very ephemeral freshness, besides a strong incensed nuance, though creamy. This is the part where many think is the cinnamon acting, but it's not. As the scent continues evolving, the spices dominate the environment, literally (hence the name \"Spice Bomb\"). The Saffron screams! It's earthy, creamy and unique. Then, a mild cinnamon is sprinkled over this mix of nuances full of mysterious and sensuality. At the same time, the base starts getting more virile, when the leather and tobacco emerge, ending the evolution and keeping the fragrance warm and lasting. I hardly identify the vetiver, but it's right there, at the bottom, with dry aspect. \nFans of colognes such as 1 Million and Avant Garde, among others that walk through the families of oriental and spicy fragrances, will enjoy Spicebomb, for sure. I just don't think it's a cologne for those who seek to conquer someone. In my opinion, is a fragrance of the man who has already conquered what (or who) he wanted, the one who knows exactly what he wants and is not concerned about what people think about him. Moreover, it is impossible not to be noticed with this scent.

That's the dry-down of Stronger With You Absolutely. And it is simply beautiful\ud83d\udc96 Perhaps for this reason I can't see this fragrance working well on a woman. It brings back fantastic memories of that sawmill, where I pretended to be the world's most macho lumberjack\ud83d\ude0a \nIt must be the chestnut and the rest of those base notes working their magic to give that gorgeous dry-down. And you get little (tiny) whiffs of that fougere heart with the lavender and Davana. This truly is a sumptuously blended fragrance. I will keep this for the colder winter days - it is made for cuddling. A mere 3 sprays got beyond 12 hours, and it was still present after showering. I woke up this morning with hints of the scent lifting off my chest. Yes, it has formidable performance. \nWhat's all the more amazing is I received this as a free gift for being such a good customer of one of the online perfume stores here in South Africa. 2021 Has been a wonderful year of fragrance discovery for me, and Stronger With You Absolutely is most certainly one of the highlights\u2b50", "1": "This is marvelous. Best of the line, despite the fact that the marketing campaign lied to us. \nIt's sweet, but not synthetic and cloying like Ultra Male kind of fragrances. It has lots of natural vanilla in a very oriental character. The 'boozy' note - ain't much of it. A bit alcoholy for the first minute after spraying, but then it's rich, dense, sweet, and resinous. There's lavender, but very, very far from Le Male or toilet cleaner kind of things. The lavender, mixing with resins and vanilla, brings a 'purple', I'd say glazed plum with cinnamon smell. The sweetness with orientals creates a glazed/roasted chestnut vibe tying it with the rest of the line. \nAbsolutely the best of the line. While being sweet, it's mature enough it can be worn by anyone. Totally unisex for me. Gourmand, even. Very rich and dense. Armani said it's going to be the strongest in the line, it isn't true. Intensely lasts longer. Absolutely works for 8, maybe 10 hours, projects strong for two-three then becomes moderate, but with a great sillage. Because of the maturity it's not known by many people, actually, for a Stronger with You line it flies under the radar. I'm afraid this might get discontinued. I can actually imagine paying more than I did for that fragrance. \nOutstanding for autumn because it's so warm. Will work in winter, both in day, and night. Will do for colder spring, maybe even at night in the summer.

I find this really sophisticated, classy and unique.", "3": "Boy do I love this! \u2764\ufe0f \nThis came in the mail today & I couldn\u2019t be happier with this one. It\u2019s my favourite of the line. I\u2019m not really into sweet fragrances & was almost convinced not to buy this based on reviews that insisted that this was overly sweet. It\u2019s sweet but hardly overly unless you go trigger happy. \nVery smooth & seductive. At least that\u2019s what the Mrs said! \ud83d\ude09 \nLongevity: 8-10+ hrs \nProjection: 3+hrs strong, then settles to a nice scent bubble that surrounds you. \nThose around will smell you for the entire duration of the fragrance.  \nI never recommend blind buying, but at least if you\u2019re curious, give it a sniff.  \n11/10 \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd", "4": "What an absolute beast.

Perhaps the ambrox mixing with the iris/white florals? \nI feel that the brand's cultish following and \"it girl\" appeal might be skewing the love bar a bit. It's nothing this remarkable or extraordinary, just like their cute Vaseline lip balms and moisturizers are not extraordinary and their rehashed Clinique marketing is not extraordinary, but it really feels like a breath of fresh air to a consumer who lives in an era of extreme income inequality, political turmoil, information bombardment, and predatory parasocial relationships in the beauty industry, and Glossier offers a sense of clarity, simplicity, a pseudo-French name for those who dream of what it's like to be a French cool girl. And therefore everything Glossier does somehow becomes revolutionary, so ingenious, so cool girl.  \nIt's a nice skin scent, and the bottle design and marketing is elegant, very reminiscent in its pearlescent rounded shape of two other similar soft musk classics, Cacharel Noa and Gap Close. But it's also $60 for the kind of skin scent I want to lavishly spray on 10 times a day guilt-free. That's $120 for 100ml.  \nMaybe in another life I would love you, Glossier You, but you're loved for all the wrong reasons.

However, the curiosity did persist in the back of my mind. I've gone back and forth on getting this weird 'You Glossier'. \nOkay, okay, I gave in and ordered it.\nI had forgotten about it and one Sunday afternoon after being in the pool all day it arrived at my front door. Sunday deliveries, cool.\nI had just showered and thought okay, let's do this.\nI opened the bottle and sprayed the cap (I usually do that). First impression from smelling the cap: \n\"Oh boy, this is Really masculine\". \nI asked my husband to smell the cap and see if he would want it since it seemed too masculine for me.\nHe smelled the cap and said: \"H\u20acll no, I wouldn't wear that sh`t. That's way too flowery\". \nI smelled the cap again, and again (to me) it smelled like a nice soapy clean, non-floral, 'masculine scent'. \nI asked him again: \"are you sure, Babe\"?\n\"That's not Men's Mami, sorry\", he replied. \nOkay, well, only way to find out is to actually wear it.\nI sprayed the inside of my left elbow and my right wrist (in my head to even out my test).\nOnce on MY skin, it was a chic soft, feminine floral, sophisticated art museum, clean sleek modern scent.\nI was walking in a cloud of deliciousness.\nAbout an hour later I happened to walk past my husband in the kitchen. He turned around, smiled, and hugged me from behind. He kissed my shoulder and said I smelled really nice. Mind you I had sprayed my inner elbow and opposite wrist. Also, it should be noted that we're not newlyweds all huggy, lovey, and stuff. We've been married over 20yrs, with kids, all sorts of pets (3 dogs, a snake, and a tarantula) mortgages, cars, bills, busy life, etc. \nA good 4 or 5 hours later, one kid sat next to me on the couch and said \"you smell nice mom\". \nAbout 3 hours after that, Kissing the little one Goodnight, he literally stuck his nose on the inner elbow where I had sprayed and said \"yeap, that smells good\", rolled over and went to sleep.\nAlmost 12 hours after the initial spray I kid you not, I was still in my cloud as if I had just sprayed it. How is that possible?!\nIn bed that night I put my nose to my inner elbow and switched between my wrist.\nWhat on G-d's green earth?!\nIt is so not masculine, not pencil shavings, idk. \nTo me, on MY skin its a soft floral, slight powdery, but not vintage or baby powder, and the musk is head turning delicious. Maybe this is the note that gives it that edgy sophistication. I was even picking up a delicious and wet juicy berry fruit medley. Maybe even a pinch of pineapple. If this scent is to blend with one's chemistry, this baby was made for me.\nI am completely Hooked, Addicted, Obsessed!\nDefinitely picking up another back up bottle.\nBecause it depends on one's chemistry you can't go by reviews, and you really have to try it to see if its a good match for you. \nI can see a bit of similarity with Juliette Has A Gun 'not a perfume', as far as the airy/ozonic tone but not the same at all. I actually don't care for Juliette's not a perfume as that too is a hit or miss based on one's chemistry. \nHope my experience helped a bit :D \nUpdate: \nPurchased two (2) new bottles for back up.

I have been on the fence about this fragrance for years, and while I have spent $500+ on blind buys, I do not know why I was worried about spending $60 on this one ;) The way our/my mind works sometimes! \nI sprayed this a couple of times on each arm, and my first thought was: lightly scented water! What? I could barely smell anything. But, then the scent just \"bloomed\" and all of a sudden I could smell it and it is wonderful. The scent to me can be best described as clean, warm skin. It is like taking a hot shower with a creamy bar of Dove soap and then putting on some very light musk scented lotion or cream. Glossier You is a really great scent. It is not sexy or special or earth shattering....but I can see reaching for this a lot, especially when you want to smell like you....just better ;)", "3": "My favorite fragrance, and always proves hard to describe.  \nDefinitely powdery. Definitely iris. Definitely musky. \nIt\u2019s something you\u2019ve smelled before but just can\u2019t identify. People will smell it on you and ask what it is.  \nComparatively.. it\u2019s like a more adult, refined Loves Baby Soft. And I mean that as a compliment. \nPackaging and bottle is cute. But, the light pink haze scrapes off. If that\u2019s important to you it\u2019s not purse transport friendly.  \nValue.. is middle of the road. It\u2019s not a super intense fragrance so I find I use more. The amount you get is deceiving (a glossier trademark) as it looks like there\u2019s just more than there is.  \nNow, would that stop me from splurging on it? Nope. \nWord of caution for Glossier girls out there. Glossiers body products, unfortunately, do NOT smell like this.

As the youngest of 4 sisters, I know well the feeling this fragrance emulates.\nGlossier You brings to life the essence of how my 10 year old self saw her sisters growing up. It isn\u2019t the sultry image of a woman that movies and magazines tried to sell her. It\u2019s women as she sees them. Effortless and embracing of her own beauty.\nOn me, You starts with a sharp pink pepper note that is softened by a subtle purple floral. It\u2019s unisex, but slightly girly without trying too hard. After about 20 minutes, the pink pepper slowly evaporates and hands the spotlight to its iris notes, while introducing a creamy face powder scent \u2014 reminiscent of sneaking into your mothers vanity, and catching that first whiff of her blush as you click open the compact.\nThe dry down immediately brings me to a moment in The Virgin Suicides. The sisters in their nightgowns, seated around a bed painting eachothers nails \u2014 caught in a daydream of Saturday morning boredom. It sits close to the skin in a cloud of musk that is distinctly feminine. On me, the ambrox brings out an animalic sweetness, in perfect harmony with the rest of the composition. \nIf fragrances had eyes, you\u2019d catch a sparkle in this one; but only if you looked closely. It\u2019s intimate, it\u2019s innocent, and it\u2019s beautiful.

In Prague with my wife, we dip into a perfumery as she wants to check out something. I\u2019m used to this being a relatively long process so gravitate over to the TF counter. The wife just bought a Killian bamboo (very nice) and I\u2019m looking at the private blends. Just for fun, I pick up the bitter peach (it\u2019s a hot day) expecting it to be very feminine and not for me. To start with I\u2019m going to offer this advice. There\u2019s a lot of noise about this fragrance, so you need to put all that to the side and just try it on your skin.  \nFirst spritz: a really intense hit of bitter peach and orange. Very nice on a warm summer evening. Fun. And I liked it a lot. But having made quick decisions before and regretted as things dry down (and given the price point), I let my wife smell it (she really liked it on me) and we went to have a drink and a walk.  \nThis is where things got interesting. I sniffed my arm intermittently. And I liked it even more. After a good 2 hours my wife is noticing during aperitif that I\u2019m sniffing and smiling. A lot.  \nThe dry down on this is what makes it. You are left with that peachiness but it develops into a woody, faintly floral and slightly amber skin scent. It\u2019s morning here and I just smelled my arm again. It\u2019s still there, faint but really, genuinely very, very good.  \nTo me this is perfectly unisex, and I would argue that the Drydown makes it lean more masculine.  \nAnd it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s really fun. It makes me smile. And it\u2019s been a long time since I smelled my arm and smiled repeatedly.  \nIs it worth the price point. As I said to my wife: \u201cThat b@stard Ford has done it again\u201d, he makes perfumes that I consistently reach for, that challenge and make me smile, and that I really enjoy smelling on me. They happen to be expensive. Which is clearly a pisser. \nI don\u2019t know what made me reach for the bitter peach, maybe just a whim, the colour, the heat, the fact that I\u2019m quite partial to a peach ice-tea, but I\u2019m very glad I did.  \nI went back and bought a bottle, luckily my wife had a discount of 15% which helped a bit.  \nI\u2019ll leave it here: try it, all of our skin chemistries are different, and some of love smells and tastes that others don\u2019t, are indifferent about or find repulsive.  \nI find value judgements about the TF brand largely irrelevant to the conversation, was it better before, has it sold out? Honestly my dear fragrance lovers, who cares?  \nWhat I care about is smelling nice and fragrances that lift, make me happy and that I enjoy wearing. Bitter peach is now part of that roster.", "1": "If this were a quarter of the price, I would be into it. It\u2019s the olfactory equivalent of eating a peach-flavored Jelly Belly. It\u2019s peach, through and through; distilled, sugary, and with a peach-fuzz vibe that\u2019s most likely conveyed by the sandalwood and cashmeran.  \nThe trouble, for me, is that no matter how many notes are in this, all I really get is PEACH. It smells youthful, juicy, sweet, and sort of playful. Which would be fine, if this were a $90 fragrance, but for Tom Ford prices, I want complexity and depth, not a one-note bit of fun. \nI will say, I love Angel, and this smells almost nothing like Angel to me. At leas not the EDP. It may have just a little resemblance to the Angel EDT. The peach here is juicy&sweet&tangy in a way that is broadly similar to the juicy&sweet&tangy of red berries, praline, and vanilla in Angel EDT's opening. But Angel EDT is much funkier and more gourmandish than BP\u2019s overwhelming juicy peach note.", "2": "So I just got a bottle today and sprayed it on a small spot on my arm. The first initial spray was decently harsh, could throw some people off. It lives up to the \u201cbitter\u201d in the name, but definitely isn\u2019t horrendous, I actually enjoyed it. The main thing you smell is definitely peach, obviously. It\u2019s very very realistic which is kinda crazy? It isn\u2019t your typical syrupy or overly sweet peach, it\u2019s like a peach you just picked, juicy, fragrant, and just perfectly ripe. I literally just smell a very juicy peach in this, and I\u2019m not the biggest peach fan with fragrances. \nAs it dries down, you get a bit of extra freshness which is really nice. The sandalwood comes in for a good creamy bit of richness to it. I still think the craziest thing is how the peach actually stays the entire time. Usually a peach note would just kinda fly away after the first 15-20 minutes at most but it\u2019s there the entire time.  \nI can say I thoroughly enjoy this. Performance is way better than Lost Cherry, and isn\u2019t as thick or syrupy. It\u2019s a lot more fresh and bright. This is a perfect summer or early fall fragrance. The only thing that keeps me from fully recommending is the price, but if you can get your hands on it, you won\u2019t be disappointed. I absolutely love it.", "3": "My Bitter Peach arrived from Nordstrom New York City, and I am in LOVE!! I have 8-9 Tom Ford scents (my favs are Tobacco Vanille, Lost Cherry and Noir de Noir) and I am quite sure Bitter Peach will be in my top 3-4 fav scents. \nInitial spray is strong and V E R Y peachy, almost peach rings candy peachy (good thing I happen to absolutely love peach rings ;) ) While the peach scent is very strong and almost realistic and very sweet, it is not a juvenile sweet. \nWithin 10-15 mins, the very strong and sweet peach candy note softens, and like magic...Bitter Peach warms up, softens and woody and balsamic notes take the wheel. \nI was so nervous after that Fragrantica writer bashed Bitter Peach, and maybe it was done because of the stupid high price (yes, it is overpriced), but Bitter Peach is magical. I cannot stop smelling my arm. 1-2 sprays on my arm, and 4 hours later...it has softened but is still very there and smells even better.", "4": "Well, I just spritzed 1 Spray on my wrist today afternoon so let me give you a small review. The opening is slightly harsh - reminded me a lil of Thierry Muglers Angel, but that period didn\u2019t last Very long. After that the peach is Very noticeable with some sharpness coming through - in this phase it\u2019s Very intense, sweet and sharp - this lasts like an hour/hour and a half. Then its starting to get smoother and super fruity (i can smell peach and mango - Even tho it isnt there) which lasts the most time. It was just 1 spritz and I could smell it all day around me Even tho i wasnt smelling my wrist, so longevity and sillage is pretty good. Leans more feminine in my opinion. Overall it is a good fragrance and in my opinion a good adition to the line because its completely different than the other private blends."}, "144": {"0": "Have you ever experienced that serendipitous situation where you go somewhere far away, buy something mundane you never thought you would love so deeply, only to never find it again? Well, La Belle Le Parfum is an old love, lost and reincarnated in a bottle.\nIt was the middle of summer in Paris, 2017. I was at the Saint Lazare train station, saw a Lush store and remembered that i needed soap. So i bought one. I literally told the store clerk my needs based on my skin type, not a single soap \nin mind. She looked at me and said \"this is the one for you\". I wish i could remember which one it was, but i can't. All i remember is how much i loved using it and how much i regretted not buying a few of those (no lush stores where i live). To me, Paris will forever smell like a soft -yet noticeable- waft of vanilla that hides something spicier underneath. The true equivalent of a woman walking around the city in a large trench coat and sunglasses, may only God know what she's hiding under it. \nDay by day, bit by bit, the soap left me. And i left France. \nSometimes, things are meant to be enjoyed for a while and that's it. I made my peace with it, and moved on with my life.\nAlmost four years later, i was running errands -and, as anyone who is into perfumes- searching for a specific fragrance that is still running away from me. The store clerk said that, as expected, i would not have that scent today. Instead, she showed me La Belle Le Parfum, sprayed it and...it was nice. Ok, it was more than \"nice\": there was this pear note, so juicy and all over my face. But as good as it was, i was not into it like crazy. I said thanks and walked around the store, trying to buy the things i went there for. I say \"trying\", because the moment La Belle Le Parfum dried down, it. was.on. It was game over for me. \nI tried to concentrate, thinking why i was so distraught. Something in the back of my mind was awakening, a memory. It felt like now i knew what hides under the trench coat: i'm the woman wearing it, and i won't tell you. The pear note dissipated, showing something spicy, almost cinnamon-like. The vanilla notes showed up later, made themselves more noticeable, but i couldn't be fooled anymore: Paris came back to me, in a sultry bottle.\nSaying that i'm obsessed is an understatement. \nSaying that i'm in love with it will never be enough.", "1": "Hello, this is my first review\ud83d\ude42. \nThis is perfume has to grow on you as it has on me. \nAt first, I was expecting something similar to the original but it wasn\u2019t at all.

The smoke is pretty minimal on my skin, I didn\u2019t even notice it until reading another review. As far as the notes, I can barely tell this is pear, it barely reads fruity. It\u2019s mostly sweet and spicy. I always worry pear will be too fake or holiday spice candle on me, but this doesn\u2019t read like pie or Christmas at all on me. It\u2019s extremely seductive.

I\u2019m wearing this in jeans and T-shirt and I feel the need to put on something ultra sexy and femme.  \nI realized this is *somewhat* similar to Pure XS by Paco Rabanne. But pure XS has a salty popcorn note, where this is spicy. Also, the sweet notes smell much more juvenile in pure XS than La Belle. I like Pure XS, but there\u2019s no need to own it if you have this.

You will get a ton of compliments, especially from men, this one just reels them in for some reason lol. Unlike Pink Sugar, this one is not as vulgar as PS can be (mind you, I like PS too), so it's much more wearable. It's an adorable scent overall, a very delicious kiwi-white chocolate scent, it smells more like cake than candy; Fruity-tart and milky-sweet with a creamy texture. Makes you feel cozy and yummy, and it does make me hungry smelling it. My mom is in her 50's even she drooled over it when she smelled it on me, and immediately bought her own bottle. Lasting power? Excellent, minimum 8 hours on me. Sillage? Perfect. Price? Very budget friendly, and makes this one a winner. I would wear this all year round, but lightly in summer. \nBtw, for those who are afraid of ending up smelling like a bimbo wearing this scent (or other scents of this nature)...honey, let me tell you, if you are a bimbo, you'll smell like one no matter what you wear.

I find it to be a wonderful fragrance....it is not that expensive, love the bottle (cute and pink and I have never had any leakage), and it lasts all day on my skin (a work day so about 9 hours). \nAt first spritz, I get tart-n-tangy fruitylicious kiwi and litchi and then seconds later....I am bombarded with creamy white nestle chocolate...yummy...it is sweet but not overly and annoyingly so...this white cocoa element gives me a sense of warmth and calm (especially as I sit in my office listening to Sade)...and then the drydown is all musky and woodied up and that - to me - is where the sensuality of the scent emerges (as the white cocoa lingers on and on!) \nI used to be turned off by the woody quality in this perfume because back in the day, I found myself smelling like an old rotted tree with moss and fungus growing on it (and it was NOT a good look/feel) so I held onto Fantasy but rarely used it but thank God for time, change, persistence, and new perspective because now - for whatever reason - I find Fantasy to be the the BOMB DIGGETY!! Ladies -- never give up on a scent because things can and always do CHANGE! \nWithin the past 2 weeks I have worn Fantasy on 5 days and I have received SEVERAL compliments from men, women, and even my college students (I work at a university) and most importantly, I LOVE the way this perfume smells and Fantasy makes ME feel like a sexy, sweet, tender, and empowered woman...and I am 32 years young! Holla :) \nI think this fragrance is for ANY woman/girl who enjoys the finer perfumes in life and can appreciate the SWEETNESS in life. She is beautiful, feminine, fun-loving, and confident! Personally, I think you can wear this anytime of year (day or night) depending upon your personal style and preference BUT I am realizing that it is perfect for fall in the daytime. At night, I tend to go for more sweet and spicy to hit 'em with that UMPH! \nShout out to Britney Spears and Elizabeth Arden! Fantasy is alright with me!!!", "2": "Im fairly late to the party with Britney Spears perfumes really but Im catching up. So I have my very own big pink bottle of Fantasy as of this afternoon.\nAnd two things are funny to me about it. The first is in all the 100s of reviews I've read over the years, I have always pondered on the much mentioned 'kiwi fruit'. I honestly didnt think kiwi fruit had any fragrance to it, let alone a distinctive one that bowled people over. I thought it must be one of those 'creative' made up exotic notes to make it sound really unique because what other perfume has kiwi in it ?\nSo today I sprayed myself liberally and waited a few moments to see what I could detect and there was immediately a note that I could only describe as........'kiwi fruit'. Whatever it is its definately 'kiwi fruit' to the nose. \nThe second strange thing is I have the urge to spray the nossle straight up my nose !! Weird. Its such an intense addictive screamer of a gourmand, I want to ingest it preferably by snorting it. So weird. \nI never thought I would have a bottle of this because of a bad scent experience with a former work colleague dousing herself.non stop. Thankfully it hasn't ruined the scent, enough time has gone by that I no longer associate her face with Fantasy. But.....I now understand what she was doing !! She wanted to bathe in it, I want to snort it. \nIm just as bad. \nReally loving it. Im enjoying the 'intensity' of the sweetness. Packs a punch. Its a belated but very happy love for me.", "3": "I am almost 50, still ride bumper cars, play Putt Putt Golf and yes, it's true; I wear Fantasy Perfume.  \nIt's a white chocolate cupcake with fruity notes and a hint of musk to keep it real. A beautifully blended confection that leaves a smile on my face every time I catch a whiff.  \nThis scent really blows my hair back on those days I have a sweet tooth. (hubby loves it too!) Definitely a treat for all ages - Cheers!", "4": "I am a Guy and I use 'Fantasy'. \nThere I said it. \nJudge me if you'll want but I love this fragrance. \nIt is juicy fruits and whipped cream drizzled with white chocolate\nAnd sprinkled with icing sugar. \nI use it on days when I am going out with friends to the mall or to have a day of fun. \nI've even used it to nights when I went clubbing. \nAnd I've never had someone tell me I smell fem or like a chick. \nIn fact I've had people ask me what is that awesome scent or sniff me and be like yum you're good enough to eat. \nSo I can suffice to say it suits my skin chemistry. \nI've even had total strangers walk past me and stop me and say dude you smell like a childhood dream. \nSo judge all you want\nBut fantasy is childhood and fun in a pink bottle for me and I love it all the way from the fruity top to the chocolatey, vanilla musk woodsy drydown. \n8/10"}, "146": {"0": "Ah, yes, Swedish Fish.

There's not much mystery to it, again straying from the unexpectedness we have come to expect from Mugler. It's lovely and girly, and doesn't take itself too seriously. The drydown neutralises it in a way that lets you know this isn't just for teenagers, but for any woman who is all smiles and sees the best in life.  \nThis fragrance is very fun, and while not as edgy as Mugler fans might have expected, it does something to brighten up its wearer's day. \n(I'm not sure how widely sold Swedish Fish are, but for anyone who hasn't heard of it, it's a very common candy in North America!)", "1": "I\u2019m obsessed.

Here's the thing, I actually own perfumes from Creed that are way more expensive and last just as long as this one!.. I think we all have a few of these in our collection. We just have to take the good with the bad and the strong with the weak, lol..so what if we have to reapply?

It's intimate and people you let close enough will smell you. And I'm sure they'll think you smell great.  \nThe fact that it's fresh, but not your typical fresh (for example; clean laundry, shampoo, citrusy, summery fresh..)scent makes it even more special in my book. It's the perfect combination of floral, a little fruity and clean musky.  \nIt is feminine with capital f. Elegant, graceful and all other adjectives in this line. \nWhen I wear it I can not help but carry myself in a bit different manner,than my usual (I love rather strong, gender banding scents ),so with this one...I just feel like painting my nails and react softly to everything...did I mention it smells like romance?  \n10/10", "2": "Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet is the epitome of elegance. This fragrance is the most excellent blend of flowers in a floral fragrance. Very fresh, airy, sheer, and luminous. This fragrance will make any girl that uses it feel like a princess. Just like Christian said \"After women, flowers are the most divine creations\" and this perfume really is the best floral I have ever smelt. From it's elegant bottle to it's light pink liquid, everything about the creation of Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet is exquisite. \nI sprayed this on last night after my shower and I can still smell it lightly on me, so for an EDT it does last. The reason I think people don't think this lasts is because it turns into a skin scent after a few hours and a lot of people expect this fragrance to scream out intense projection as fragrances of today do, especially for it's price point. However, do not be mislead because this perfume is a classic that will always stand out. This fragrance reminds me of a fragrance you would love to use for special moments such as a wedding day, or a special date. \nI have loved Lanc\u00f4me's Miracle for years as my signature, but Blooming Bouquet is very slowly trying to take Miracle's spot. \nIn a world of today where perfumes stay in the sugar bomb zones, or too musky, it's refreshing to know there will always be a little bit of Blooming Bouquet by your side :). x \u2765\u2765", "3": "This is my first review here, and also I'm swedish so my english isn't perfect, so please be nice <333 \nI am very picky with my perfumes, and I easily feel ill when the perfume is too sweet or too much vanilla.

There's a local perfume shop right across where I live, I've always wanted to go there but I, as a fairly socially awkward person, avoided it. That's until I took a peek inside and saw they had some Guerlain classics I've always wanted to sniff. \nThe owner of the shop is an older woman, she greeted me very warmly. I got to it and sniffed all the fragrances I've always wanted, but there was one missing, and that was Shalimar. Thinking this yet again wasn't my time for that, I was going to thank the lady and leave. But that's when she approached me and asked me if I personally liked Guerlain. We started chatting about our shared interest in perfumery for a bit, until I took a chance and asked ''Do you have Shalimar?'' \nHer face lit up and she said ''No not here, but I'll go check in the back for you.'' I waited until she came back with a bottle of this beautiful perfume and sprayed it on paper for me to sample. Then she told me: the bottle wasn't from the shop, it was her own bottle. Vintage. From her personal collection.  \nI was so, so happy really I can hardly describe it. I guess she saw that on my face and asked if I wanted to sample on skin, took my arm, and sprayed my wrist. We kept talking. About perfumes she had on her shop, national brands, her own life and customers, along other things for quite a while. It got dark outside, and she gave me some sample decants to take home and we both thanked each other for the quality time together, and headed home. \nI really can't describe how happy I was. This lady was so kind to me, and I don't even know her name! At least yet. \nShalimar is, honestly, everything I hoped it was. The reviews made no exaggeration, it's incredible. The citrus opening, the flowers enveloping the citrus, the vanilla and incense dry down that smells divine. I went to sleep, and after I woke up, the incense and leathery notes on my wrist were still there. I would call it a masterpiece, but I feel like my youth and little experience in this fragrance world doesn't make me worthy of that yet. \nWhat I can say for sure is, it's ageless. Timeless. I don't normally share my age online, I'm a young adult. My age still ends in teen. I love Shalimar. The lady I talked to, a much older woman than me, said that was her go-to scent most of her life, and that she treasures the current bottle she has. She loves Shalimar. We both love Shalimar. \nI'm not sure why this made me quite emotional I confess. Maybe the kindness of the lady, maybe the perfume itself owning up to all my na\u00efve expectations, maybe the feeling of connection with other women throughout time because of love for a particular perfume. Maybe all of it. Maybe something more. I just know it did. I will treasure that day, that lady, and this perfume on my mind for as long as I can. Until one day, another young girl might ask me ''Do you have Shalimar?''", "1": "I\u2019m a college professor, and my niche is in aging and the end of life. My students all know about my perfume hobby, as I always spritz the papers and assignments I hand out. It\u2019s even included in an \u201cabout me\u201d part of my syllabi. (I think I\u2019ve converted a few to becoming fragrance enthusiasts too!) Today we went to a nursing home for a \u201cmeet your neighbors\u201d roundtable so my students could get a glimpse into the lived experiences of elderly community members. I overheard one of my students talking to a lady in her 80s, telling her that their professor likes perfume. I walked over, asking the resident if she too shared the hobby. She nodded, but due to cognitive impairment or social anxiety, had difficulty conversing with me. I asked about Chanel N\u00b05. She balked at the suggestion. \u201cWhat about Shalimar?\u201d And with that, her eyes lit up, her head nodded, her mouth whispered, \u201cShalimarrrrrrrrrr...\u201d \nMy eyes, too, light up to Shalimar. And my new friend has a mini bottle coming her way on our next visit. \nShalimar is an all-time classic. Perhaps the sexiest scent ever. May the vanilla, leather, citrus, incense, smoke\u2014and yes, even the civet\u2014seduce you too. Disregard age; throw out gender. Shalimar doesn\u2019t exist for those boxes. It\u2019s transcendent.", "2": "My Grandmother, a beautiful and elegant lady spent most of her working adult life behind the Perfume Counter at Famous Barr in St. Louis. To many, she was known as the \"Perfume Lady\". To me, she was my \"Mimi\", and I owe my love of finer fragrance all to her. \nWe lost her nearly two years ago. It was heartbreaking to say \"goodbye\", and I am so grateful that I had the chance to laugh with her just one last time before she took her next step in this amazing journey. It was her dying wish that we all take a little something (or things) from her home by which we could remember and cherish her--and enjoy.  \nThe day of her funeral was mostly a haze. It was February in St. Louis, frigid, cold, yet hopeful. We honored her in a spirit of joy and laughter. I wore Neela Vermeire's Mohur. I knew Mimi would approve. My mom told me that I smelled \"lovely\", and took me in her arms and cried. My Great Aunts remembered with pride Mimi's Lunch with Elizabeth Taylor--not on one, but TWO occasions. It seems that she had sold the most White Diamonds AND Passion in the City, and that was her prize.  \nGetting back on track--Shalimar. Where does this fit in? For Birthdays and Holidays, Mimi always gifted my Mom with Shalimar. She had all of the concentrations, Extrait in the gorgeous, small Baccarat bottle. So heady and luscious. I remember Mom telling me the difference between the concentrations, and smelling them all back to back as a child, all the way to the Eau de Cologne, with its conical top. I was hooked. \nAfter the funeral, we all went to Mimi's house, the home she worked hard to build and pay for, for so many years. There were no reminders to take off our shoes, or not to run by the stairs, in case we might fall down. No gentle voice reminding us to stay away from her succculents, lest the spines \"jump out at us\" and stick us. Just silence and reverence for a life well lived. I stepped into her bedroom, and on her night stand, I beheld her SOLE bottle of perfume displayed. A gold Guerlain atomizer. I picked it up, opened the lid and smelled the incense and leather, the vanilla and musk. I was home. Tears fell from my eyes, and I knew what gift Mimi wanted me to have. I treasure this bottle. When I want to feel close to her, I indulge myself, tenderly kiss the bottle that her hands held and again I feel her presence nearby. \nThis is the beauty and magic of Shalimar for me. A fragrance of unparalleled beauty and refinement, just like my Mimi.", "3": "I hate the ageism that's so rampant when it comes to perfumes. It's ridiculous!  \nShalimar has been around a long time yes, but it's loved by many women of all ages, including those in their early 20s like me. :) \nShalimar is timeless, smells in general are ageless, end of story.", "4": "PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS GOOD, DO NOT TEST SHALIMAR IF YOU HAVE NOT PROPERLY PREPARED YOURSELF! \nThis is directed to the harsh, almost violent anti-Shalimar reviews that are peppered in among the adoring, gushy, positive reviews here. \nIt almost seems like nonsense to review Shalimar, but I feel like more than a fragrance review, it is essential to tell my experience. \nOnce upon a time, not too long ago, I was a fragrance newbie. I loved light, sweet fragrances and anything with any silage whatsoever was \"too much.\" Now that I look back I realize that I was culturally acclimated to believing that strong silage was a sign of age (not in a good way) or cheapness. Interestingly, I thought that high quality fragrances were subtle and watery. \nBut then I \"accidentally\" met Shalimar Parfum Initial. I had smelled Shalimar at Sephora (I believe it was only the EDT at the time), and I almost retched right in the store. But being the collector I am, I thought I \"needed\" to have at least one form of this fragrance, so I did some research and decided that at the price I got it for and with the reviews, PI was the way to go . . . and boy, was it! \nI adored PI, mostly after I started getting rave compliments from people. It wasn't the initial top notes, but the drydown that was so stunning. And I thought \"why not get right to the drydown,\" but realized that the top notes were essential or you'd have just a powdery, vanilla scent like so many others. \nAs time has passed, I determined to try the hated Shalimar again, partially because of the rave reviews for its leather note. I gingerly sprayed a test strip, and let it dry down before carefully sniffing. Okay. There's my beloved leather! I can now put this in the \"like\" category. \nBut then I got a decant of the EDT, and after avoiding it for several months, I started to spray a teeny bit here and there. Usually before a shower or before bed. I started to notice the development from one moment to the next, and was startled at how amazingly complex this scent was. Much more than any other scent I had tried (or probably more than any I've tried to this date), this fragrance continued to morph and change and wrap around me like gorgeous (and sometimes \"stanky\" in a good way) sparkling, seductive, serpents (ok, stupid analogy, but I had to use all \"Ss\" for effect). \nBy the time I tried the EDP again, I was already in love. Now I don't wear the EDP yet, and don't know that I ever would. It's stunning, but almost like you don't wear your fine china. This one is a masterpiece to be admired, not for casual wear (for me). But all the other Shalimars are fair game. \nSo please, please, PLEASE! For your own sake, do NOT spray this on, sniff, cough, and then write scathing reviews after disposing of what you consider to be toxic waste. This is art! And it's gorgeous to myself, who was once a hater.  \nIf you have not learned to love civet, oakmoss, aldehydes and other \"big-girl\" notes, start with some of the easier flankers. Souffle, PI (any of them, but especially Si Sensuelle), and Eau de Shalimar are a much better way to start. These are all beautiful granddaughters of the Grand Dame herself.  \nAs a perfume lover, you owe it to yourself to learn how to understand this one.", "5": "It is an 88 degree, humid day in Florida.  I questioned my choice but, stuck with it.  Shalimar EDP.  I will never be able to adequately express my delight in this slice of heaven.

I will wear this in any weather, season or temperature.  It guarantees satisfaction for me everytime.\n\n20 years ago, I would have stayed far away from Shalimar.  Now, it's my everything.

Isn't it wonderful that we can still buy online the things we like, the things that make us happy even for a brief moment? \n\nShalimar is the only perfume that can offer the comfort I need at times like this. Maybe it's because its slightly scorched vanilla and powdery-smoky quality reminds me of happy childhood moments, although as far as I can remember none of my relatives have ever worn Shalimar.\nBut for some reason I associate the scent of Shalimar with warm comforting hugs, beauty, elegance and mystery. And happy times.\nIn my country, in the past, few people could afford to acquire French perfumes... We were behind the iron curtain, and as I grew up I noticed that the only perfumes we could find were those produced in my country. They were good enough products, but nothing that could ever compare with Guerlain. In my view, Guerlain is the perfume house that wears the crown in the fragrance industry.\nI love many Guerlain fragrances, but I think Shalimar is the absolute queen of perfumes, a timeless masterpiece, from the Art Deco bottle to the last drop of its heavenly scent. She is like a good novel, a compelling story of love, loss, and ultimately an ending surprisingly tender and sweet. A story that has the power to haunt us and draw us in again and again.\nHowever, I can't say Shalimar is a safe blind buy. In fact, the first time I smelled it from the bottle at the perfume counter many years ago, its sharp citrus odor repelled me and I didn't want to try it on my skin. But luckily, my husband was intrigued by the scent and insisted I spray a little on my wrist. I held my wrist away from my nose for a few moments, telling my husband that the odd scent reminded me of an insecticide my grandmother had used in and around her house when I was a kid. But at the same time I smiled because it was a nice memory... And the next moment Shalimar blossomed on my skin like a soft powdery flower, wafting toward my face and silently beckoning me to inhale its intriguing scent... And that's when both my husband and I fell in love with it, with the story it developed on my skin. \nSo try it before you buy. And if Shalimar loves you, you will always treasure her.", "10": "Shalimar is the Mata Hari of perfumes.  A double agent.  Sniff the bottle cap and the innocence of powdered babies greets your nose.

Dare to place it on the skin and the body's warmth and oils transform it into a Bengal feline.  Civet drenched in leather.  Myrhh incense burning in an ancient church.

There is no other like her.\n\nWear this when you are ready to awaken the divine Feminine within.", "11": "This was my grandmother's signature scent, and I think of her when I wear it.  But it's not a \"grandma\" scent.  Grandmothers were young once, and they wanted to smell sexy and rebellious.  It's not hard to imagine what they saw in Shalimar, which is still a bit dangerous.  It's powder, smoke, leather, bergamot, and vanilla predominantly.  The civet has doubtlessly been tamed since its natural origins, but Shalimar still retains the scent of skin and a faint hint of dirt. This is a boudoir fragrance that has become acceptable to wear in polite company.  Respect to grandmothers, those naughty minxes.", "12": "Really, what can I say that hasn't already been said?

I thank seasoned Guerlainophiles for encouraging me to go with a new bottle so that I can experience the freshest top notes, the bergamot and citrus sparkle. Also, the civet note in this is incredibly real-smelling, having worked with civet in dilution and knowing its presence and energy.

My skin gobbled that right up and left me with a cedar/petrichor smell. Now it's becoming floral again, and a little sweeter, but it's not letting go of that cedar. My mind is completely blown.

But regardless of how you feel about the consequences of 2020s gender politics, one benefit of the tumult has been the increasing trend toward unisex, or more properly, genderless fragrances.  To the benefit of all of us who prefer to choose scents based on how they smell and perform with our personal skin chemistry, rather than on the basis of labels or marketing campaigns, \"wear what you like\" has become the order of the day.  Well, one of the fragrances I like is the EdP version of Shalimar.\n\nI suppose it is de rigueur for me to now recite that I am a large, muscular, bearded, comfortably CIS-HET, mature male.  To my nose, Shalimar EdP is a wonderfully unisex scent with many more fragrantic tropes traditionally associated with masculine fragrances than several popular \"men's\" fragrances I can name (several Le Malle flankers come to mind as does Toy Boy & the current formulation of Platinum Ego\u00efste, among many others).  I'll elaborate:  Shalimar EdP opens with a citrus blast that would be right at home in many a men's cologne.  Later, we get animalic civietone, which is a mainstay of manly fragrance and a rich leather accord that is not very different from the leather note in Tuscan Leather.  There is also some earthy vetiver that would fit right into Creed's Original Vetiver, among other guy's scents.  I could go on, but you get my point.  Shalimar EdP is unisex, I rest my case.\n\nRegardless of the gender identity of the wearer, this fragrance is something special.  It feels not so much dated as timeless.  The fragrance is strikingly original, changes direction more times than a fleeing rabbit during its progression and features what is probably the best version of the house's signature vanilla focused base outside of the pricey and hard to source extraits.  I love wearing this fragrance solely for my own enjoyment.  I find it a calming and contemplative fragrance.\n\nI think this scent works best on colder fall and winter evenings and while it definitely suits dressier occasions, it works surprisingly well with casual attire too.  If you haven't smelled this scent, and you are even slightly a fragrance enthusiast, you must seek out the chance to smell Shalimar EdP on your skin at least once.  After that, the decision on whether or not it is for you rests entirely with your nose.  You should wear what you like, after all.", "17": "Nothing compares to Shalimar. Nothing smells as soft, yet dark and cruel at the same time. Such an intelligent fragrance. Beautiful.", "18": "if any man's still in doubt because it's stated as for women, believe me don't hesitate to buy it. I was going to rate it as unisex but just for the men who are having doubts, I voted for men if it's any sort of help. \ntrust me I was the same, but a reviewer on YouTube name AC ( channel name: smells good ) convinced me.\nso happy that I now have this in my hands and in my collection.\nblind buy and no regrets, love at first sniff. \nlove it so much I've ordered the Shalimar EDT and Habit Rouge. \n10/10 for me. \n\n(2019 batch)", "19": "Shalimar.  The Grand Dame of perfumes.  If you like cool green or fruity perfumes, this isn't for you.  Shalimar is warm and sexy.  Over the years, I've collected it in various forms -- several bottles of the classic perfume with the blue glass stopper, the 2 oz special edition EDP with the clear glass stopper, EDT and cologne.  My favorite Shalimar 'score' was a vintage bottle of perfume with the wax seal and silk cord still intact in an antique shop.  When I went to pay for my purchase, the owner looked at the bottle and said, \"I'll just give this to you.  It's so old, I'm sure it's no good anymore.  Plus no one wants these 'old lady' perfumes these days.\"  I resisted the urge to do a happy dance and run out the door clutching my priceless treasure.  I guess if you think 'old ladies' smell elegant, sexy, timeless, spicy, warm and exotic then by all means, I'm an old broad -- and happily so.  OK, I'm 60 and to some clueless youth, I'm 'old'.  I also travel the world and ride Harleys.  If that's your definition of mature women then viva la olde broads!  I also loved Shalimar at 16 so that must make me downright ancient!  Shalimar should be in the collection of anyone whose tastes in perfumes run more to the exotic -- and worn often.  I love all the Shalimars but it's the perfume that really captures the true elegant spirit of this gem.", "20": "Wow, just wow! I'm absolutely amazed, mesmerized and blown away by the beauty of Shalimar! Ever since I've tried Shalimar, everything else has paled in comparison.\n\nShalimar is indeed the Queen of Vanillas; the powdery, smokey, sultry and SEXY vanilla in this is like nothing I've ever experienced before. There's something so young and sensual about Shalimar, yet she's a sophisticated and powerful lady; someone you're deeply attracted to, yet are somewhat intimidated by. \n\nI've been wearing this everyday since I got it and I'm kicking myself for not having tried it sooner. All those \"old-fashioned\" and \"cat pee\" comments put me off of it and I was SO WRONG, so terribly wrong. To all those young ladies out there who are in doubt (I'm 25 BTW), wear this beauty proudly, it's a perfectly young, sexy and seductive queen of a scent! \n\nLong Live the Queen!", "21": "Mmm. Hello! I\u2019ve had a bottle of EDP in my perfume cupboard for years now, but I\u2019ve really only spritzed and worn at home. I\u2019m not sure why - maybe I was too afraid that my coworkers found it didn\u2019t \u201cfit\u201d me at 26 years old. That said, I\u2019ve worn No. 5 and other classics with only a few \u201cgrandma\u201d comments. \n\nFast forward to today. It\u2019s cold, it\u2019s rainy, it\u2019s MONDAY. Early morning, drinking my coffee and rewatching Season 1 of Mad Men, I hear it. \u201cShalimar?\u201d - A woman asks Joan Holloway, the VENUS of the entire show and a character who I\u2019ve always admired. My ears perked up. \u201cSo that\u2019s what this character wore?\u201d I had an idea. \n\nI dig through my cupboard and pulled my bottle out of the dark. Shalimar. I popped open the lid and spritzed a bit on the back of my neck and on my wrists. \u201cJoan.\u201d \n\nKnowing this scent takes a while to \u201cmesh\u201d and sync with your skin, I went about my morning routine. It really is pretty harsh in the opening. \n\nLeaving for work, I wrapped myself up in a scarf and popped open my umbrella. Shalimar. There it was - smoky but so sweet, wrapped with a golden ribbon of vanilla and sex appeal. I can see why this is and has always been so popular. \u201cThe real test will be the sensitive office ladies.\u201d \n\nFast forward to sitting down at my desk. A woman who sits across from me looks up as I sit down, sniffs the air and says, \u201cShalimar?\u201d - she knew! Come to find out, it was her mother\u2019s favorite. She said it smelled as good on me as she remembered it smelling on her mother. Keep in mind - she NEVER likes anything I wear! \n\nShalimar. You stuck with me throughout the day, playfully sneaking your way up my nostrils during my \u201ctunnel vision\u201d part of the afternoon. It was a great reminder, you know. A reminder of quality, of the great history this perfume has. I felt like a million bucks. \n\nI get the hype... but what I still don\u2019t get is how it was conceived.. how it was birthed into this world - how they bottled comfort and sex appeal in a way that\u2019s so fitting for so many women (and men!). How even now, after countless IFRA restrictions and reformulations, it can still be so beautiful. \n\nShalimar.", "22": "This is the most seductive woman perfume I ever smell! \nThis perfume has strong seductive power, elegance and magic. Open with powdery, incense and floral (roses/jasmine) and dry down to smooth creamy vanilla, this is one of the best vanilla ever, it real, naturally, and crisp so sexy so tasty. Base are citrus that not sharp, not light, but fresh and dry mixed with animalic and surrounding by sweet vanilla. The sillage of perfume is very special and unique (in a man opinion) this smells like a woman's skin-like note! as like a real fresh woman skin smell, that so sexynesss and I can turn my head with this sillage or walk to a woman who wears this perfume!  \n\"The pheromone in the bottle! \"\n\nScent: 10/10 (elegance/sexyness/seductive)\nSillage: 10/10 (powerful that can turn heads)\nLongevity 10/10 (all day performance)\n\nFor a man opinion this is \"Love Oil\"", "23": "My kink is wearing Shalimar in high summer. On a hot evening it smells insanely good on my skin, the incense green and toasty, bright with bergamot, the sandalwood popping. Very different to the sublime winter boudoir bomb we know and love.", "24": "Vanilla and cigarettes. A cathedral at midnight. A worn leather jacket. Loose leaf earl grey tea. Your favorite secondhand bookstore. \n\nIt took a while for me to appreciate Shalimar; she's definitely a lady that you need time to fully acquaint yourself with. Absolutely intoxicating and seductive, and she only gets better as the wear goes on.", "25": "My first encounter with Shalimar is a bit of a funny & slightly embarrassing story. I was 19 years old. I was young, engaged to be married & working full time at an upscale, classy men's clothing store for the duration of the summer. I didn't care much for the job, & actually was quite miserable, but met a funny associate a bit younger than me that made it tolerable. One late summer evening, I was in the middle of the large round dressing room with the 3 way mahogany trimmed floor length mirrors, heavy blue velvet portiere's, & rich tapestry covered settees measuring an older gentleman's  inseam for trousers. All of a sudden I tactlessly blurted out, \"Oh my gracious! WHAT is that smell\"!?!?  He pretended not to hear me, probably hoping I either was or wasn't referring to his crotch. I literally stood up and walked out of the room to follow whatever was causing my smell-gasm. I was led to a trail of scent coming from my co-worker who had arrived while I was with my client & was now vacuuming the sales floor. \nOh mylanta! She smelled incredible! It was the most intoxicating blend of spice, leather, herbs, oranges, snicker doodle cookies, deer urine & a rush of scent memories I had stored up from a trip to Agra, India two years prior, all mixed in a cloud that created some type of nirvana. I asked her what she was wearing & she said she had spent the night at her Nana's house & dabbed on her perfume since she had forgot hers, (which was probably something like Exclamation). I went to Herberger's department store the next day on my lunch break to find the parfum. Sadly it was woefully out of my working girl price range at the time. I didn't receive my own small bottle until many, many birthdays later, & I still savor my small precious bottle. This is not exactly \"me\" or a scent I would choose to wear everyday, (or even occasionally) but it is SO stunning & holy grail status.  I can recognize this on anyone the world over, but oddly enough, have quite often mistaken someone wearing Dana's Toujour Moi for Shalimar. If you are a young working girl (or gent) who can't afford this gem now, may I suggest Toujours or Coty's Emarude. Both are similar in the depth and powdery dry down and may tie you over until you can get your own bottle of this masterpiece as well.\nSo Shalimar will always be synonymous with opulence, curiosity, youth & Nana's, longing for something out of my price range & men's trousers & inseams for me. :)", "26": "Perfect for winter nights. It smells matured, vintage and powdery.  It's a classic Oriental fragrance from 1925's. \nI prefer to go light with this fragrance as it's really powerful and can be overwhelming. 2-3 sprays are all you need with this fragrance. And this will last on your skin for almost 8+ hours and even more sometimes. On clothes it lasts for about 10-12 hours with moderate projection.\nShalimar smells really elegant sexy but vintage. And the notes are really complex so I get different notes every other time. But the fresh Citrusy opening with bergamot and lemon always lifts me up. And the vanilla is really rich deep and beautiful with smokey incense notes. I can smell the Iris,Rose, Patchouli, Musk,Civet,Sharp Citrus and Leather notes. And the notes keeps changing all day long so it's a different experience. But the main player in this perfume is the smokey vanilla, powdery iris, warm civet and leather. Sometimes this smells too strong, sharp and animalic that some may find it overpowering and some may find it really sensual or erotic.\nIt's really hard to explain 'Shalimar' and that's why it's a classic.", "27": "I happened to try this perfume in a shop a few years ago - around the time I discovered that a single perfume can smell quite different on different people. Before this, I had been making great use of test strips. So, with a sense of curiosity, I sprayed a little Shalimar onto my wrist. What else could I do? The bottle seemed so majestic and so classical. Of all the perfumes, from all the houses and all the designers, she was the most beautiful and mysterious.\n\nTo a perfume novice, which I was, having never owned a perfume that wasn't a randomly selected Christmas gift, the initial scent was overwhelming. Shalimar is powerful, possessing an almost suffocating, persistent aroma. I had made a mistake. It was too much. What had I been thinking? Why hadn't I just sprayed it on a testing strip, or even into the air? \n\nDespite this, I went about my business. I pottered around shops, bought a few things, settled in a cafe for a cup of tea. The whole time, intermittently lifting my wrist to my nose. How warm it seemed, with hints of citrus and flowers I could not name. Again and again, I would catch myself doing the same thing. It was addictive, inhaling the slowly changing scent. And the longer I wore it the greater it seemed. \n\nI didn't buy it. I carried on without perfume. But every time I got the chance, I would head into the shop where I had first encountered Shalimar, and I would spray it again, letting her occupy my wrists and my nose. \n\nIn the end, my mother bought it for me, for my birthday. I hadn't been able to keep it from my lips \"Shalimar, have you tried it?\". Now, with my own bottle. I could wear it as I pleased.  This was an exciting prospect. It still is, two years later. \n\nPerhaps, my favourite time to wear Shalimar is before I go to bed. Snuggled up, nice and warm. As the cosy, powdery scent transforms into a delicate, softer vanilla. \n\nEach time I wear it, it is an experience. And I find that it greatly affects my mood for the duration of the day. My mind comforted somehow by the scents that engage my imagination and fill my head with possibilities.  \n\nI have a small perfume collection now but I wonder if anything will ever enrapture me as Shalimar has. I'm 31, so there's still a lot of time for me to try new things. But will anything else be as timeless, as consistent, as fitting? Or did I strike gold, discovering my signature perfume so early on? \n\nWe'll see.", "28": "Oh myyyyyy when I\u2019m in the mood to wear this nothing else will do. \n\nMen go mad for this even now, so I don\u2019t know why some say it\u2019s dated or hard to wear. In fact because tastes have changed so much towards liquid sugar this has turned into a hidden gem. Resinous and sensual, this is a gold standard for orientals and vanillas.\n\nComplete classic.", "29": "Shalimar is a gift, historically and to me. It comes with confirmation that I indeed have classic taste, I am not pretty-in-pink, I can rest easy and away from niche fragrance chasing. It\u2019s a slightly melancholy discovery, whereby I can confirm and admit I do believe all the great art has already been made. The great films, books, paintings and fragrances exist already. Shalimar doesn\u2019t shock or copy or campaign for undue hype. I\u2019m so happy to have it.", "30": "Shalimar debuted nearly 100 years ago, I doubt I have anything unique to add to the conversation, but I'll take a crack at it.\n\nI smell (uniquely) dry citruses off the top & a sweet, spicy vanilla. It takes nearly an hour to dry. After it settles it's incense, a soft leather, balsamic notes, florals... It's an impeccably blended, warm, and inviting fragrance. One might assume a fragrance this old would smell dated and dead, but Shalimar defies expectation, she is youthful and full of life.\n\nFor me Shalimar was a love at first sniff. Smooth, sensual, opulent, and intoxicating. I'm usually drawn to bold fragrances that make an effort to impress, but Shalimar coyly convinces me that she is effortless, and she impresses nonetheless. I hesitate to describe fragrances as sexual for a number of reasons, but this fragrance could easily be interpreted as an invitation to come closer.\n\nI live in the thick of the midwest. Our summers are humid and sickly, our winters are dry, windy, and absolutely frigid. What I mean by this is I experience the very best and very worst of fragrances. The vast majority of my orientals cannot withstand the dry, harsh cold of winter. Youth Dew becomes a panicked mess of dry, dusty, mangled spices. If you find Black Orchid hard to wear, trust me, it becomes far more difficult in the thick of winter. It transforms into an untamed, dissonant beast, absolutely unwearable in public (but an incredible experience in the privacy of my own home). \n\nI've told you this because unlike the others, Shalimar is completely unfettered. She breezes through the the most extreme of temperatures without a care in the world. It's a testament to the art of perfumery that this fragrance smells incredible year round. Shalimar truly is the undisputed champion of orientals.\n\nPerformance and projection are both stellar. Female targeted, completely unisex.\n\nEdit: gentlemen of Fragrantica, if you currently own & use the Ariana Grande perfume \"Cloud\" because it's an inexpensive alternative to Baccarat Rouge 540, I strongly encourage you to surrender your bottle to the nearest teenage girl immediately. Please dosh out the some odd $45 to Fragnet and buy Shalimar, it is not too feminine for you. You will get booty. And by booty, of course I mean the treasure of wearing Shalimar. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "31": "Inundated with suggestions in response to my question 'what made for women fragrances can or should a man wear? Shailimar was my first walk on the wild side...\n\nIn starting with Shalimar I feel I can't be accused of lacking either courage or ambition.\n\nEverything about this from the Ottoman / Csarina / chandelier bottle - to the genesis of the name and the perfume's inspiration in the past to its own history and reputation (yes the saleswoman actually asked me if I was looking for something for my grandmother) atest to towering femininity. \n\nEverything speaks of confidence, of sophistication of intrigue and intense emotion. \n\nEverything about Shalimar is woman, and a certain proud, self-aware but never self-conscious, glamorously self-posesed woman with that.\n\nSo with brass in pocket and a deep breath I take the plunge (once said shop assistant was persuaded to spray on my pulse points and not my dear deceased grandmother's)... and I find I myself diving into a pool of pure warmth and velveteen comfort, only a sensuous wave or two to knock me off balance and a rip tide to tear me under must I navigate.\n\nFrankly, this had me from hello, the minute the tips of my fingers entered Shalimar's waters I was a gonna. The amazing richness of the bergamot and orange opening seduced me immediately: it's a sort of citrus creme, a Cointreau creme brulee. \n\nYes that's it, a Cointreau creme brulee, for after the orange: vanilla. Beautiful vanilla but with oodles of cream and something in the background a hint of brandy or rum - perhaps just wooden barrels in the middle notes.\n\nFor a moment I thought that the whole delicious dessert was about to turn powder cake on me, but it was a confection, a mere passing illusion and I was able to tread water in my vanilla pod pond for several hours - the only change being a few fires or were they incense cones being lit poolside and someone cutting back a flower border further afield. But that point I was too lost in my reverie to properly distinguish the notes.\n\nShalimar was created within a decade of the death of Mata Hari and as Josephine Baker was scaling to the heights of her fame in the decadent Paris of the 1920s. The new Art Deco style was supplanting the rotten flower of art nouveau, Jazz music replacing opera comique and the modern world was just beginning. \n\nIt's not going to far to say that I feel a new perfume age is beginning for me today... \n\nImmense. Exquisite. And, I have a presentiment, indispensable.\n\nNest I tried Tabu by Dana....", "32": "Just imagine you're on a train in the 1920's with the smoke billowing and the train tooting its horn as you're reading an old romance novel while you eat your creme brulee and drink your Earl grey tea. The winter sun is coming in strong through your window and warming you up, making you feel even more relaxed. That is one of many scenarios I imagine when i wear this and it transports me to another time and place without making me feel dated.", "33": "Reaching the summit of the mountain named Shalimar is a journey in and of itself alone. It\u2019s when the magic has happened. The stars have aligned. The training wheels have finally come off. And so worth the effort it took to get there.\n\n\u201cIf she's amazing, she won't be easy. If she's easy, she won't be amazing. If she's worth it, you wont give up. If you give up, you're not worthy. ... Truth is, everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for.\u201d \u2014 Bob Marley \n\nYes, she is challenging at first, but so worth the wait. She is polarizing, for good reason, because she\u2019s amazing.", "34": "Oh, my God. No hymn can warship Shalimar enough. Shalimar is metaphysical and animalistic, down to Earth and esoteric at the same time, like attending a mass with excessive use of incense drowned in vanilla. Shalimar is downright religious. Fulfilled with the Gregorian coral, though inspired by a Hindu love story. Above all, it manages to be elegant. L'\u00e9l\u00e9gance par excellence.  It is art and science in perfect liaison. There is nothing too much and nothing too few in it. You put on Shalimar and just wait for what it will spoil you with in the next moment. And the moments go on and on. It is getting better by the minute. Time is nothing to Shalimar, neither on the skin nor to its age. It is simply made for eternity, never out of date, never too young, never too old. Because it is timeless. The depth and number of layers that most Guerlain perfumes have is endless. The multidimensionality of Shalimar is incredible. What a genius created it and what a masterpiece he created. It is hard for me to choose my favorite. Is it Shalimar or Insolence? But one thing is sure. I am a Guerlain girl.", "35": "I picked up Shalimar's beautiful bottle from a perfume counter long ago and quickly dismissed it as too much - too dark, too smoky, too intense. Many years later I have come back to it in a quirky, roundabout way: I was Googling the Doctor Who TV character River Song, headstrong and sensual, and happened to wander across two perfumes oils named after her, both oriental vanillas, cozy with a kick. I loved the idea. I tried Dior Addict, Dior Hypnotic Poison, Kenzo Amour... but on me they all shift to just sweetness, none of the mystery of the orientals remaining. \n\nAnd then there is Shalimar. I had seen it suggested over and over in perfume threads. Yesterday, on a whim, I sprayed it on my ankle, expecting an oriental bomb and trying to keep it far from my nose... but I spent the rest of the day ducking into corners and performing gymnastics to revel in the scent! Sweet, powdery vanilla and airy citrus overlaid with dark, smoky leather. The weather outside was nearly 100 degrees and humid from thunderstorms, the worst sort of day for perfume, but Shalimar stayed, close to my skin, clean and dry. The smokiness projected a little more and the sweetness stayed close against me. This morning - 19 hours later - smooth, gentle leather and vanilla linger. \n\nI skimmed the reviews and saw many reviewers alluding to its duality... mother yet lover... comfortable yet dark... sweet yet smoky. And old, yet timeless.", "36": "If I could only keep one perfume for the rest of my life, Shalimar would be it. This is in a class all of its own, totally unlike anything else I've ever owned. It makes me smell like the best version of myself rather than like a perfume...all four seasons, day or night. Magic. If you've ever tried it in the store and said, \"Phew! Why would I ever buy that?\" Do yourself a favor: On your day off, don't wear any fragrance. Go back to the store, spritz some on your wrist, and give yourself a few hours to experience it without judgement. You can thank me after you wind up buying a bottle for yourself. ;-)", "37": "The more I use you, the more of you I want.\n\nThis is not a review, it is an ode, a deserved one.", "38": "I received a sample of the EDP from a generous swap partner. It smells nothing the way I thought / remembered / imagined it to.\n\nThe opening is all Big Band; loud and in your face - citrus, leather, incense and civet - upfront and brash. Somewhere in the background I can pick up the peppery patch and vetiver.  What a way to start the party!\n\nAn hour later and the lemon burst has receded somewhat, leaving room for the smoother, creamier notes to develop.\n\nSandalwood and Tonka (dressed in leather) are entwined in a hot embrace, stealing sweet, resinous kisses while Incense smokes seductively in the corner.\n\n2 hrs later ~ The band has changed its melody and is now playing a sweeter tune. \n\nMusk and Iris take to the floor, for a slow dance. Citrus is having a quiet chat with Myrrh, while Incense works the room. Vanilla picks up with mic and starts crooning a sultry ballad.\n\n3 hrs later ~ Cedar has joined the party and Citrus snuck out some time ago, unnoticed.\n\n5 hrs later ~ Incense has dozed off, in a smoky haze. All the while Vanilla continues its bluesy serenade as Cedar chills quietly in the dark.\n\nThis is my kinda joint. I'll be here often.", "39": "The best. Masculine. Feminine. Whatever.

It's a strong mix of notes but heavy on the bergamot, which doesn't seem to mesh well and ends up smelling like butane. This lasts for a good half hour or so on my skin before it dries down..\n\nNow, the dry down.. that's where the magic lays. Spicy vanilla cookies in a cloud of incense.. mysterious and yet comforting and familiar. The rose peeks through here and there just enough to add a sweet floral warmth to the whole concoction. Powder softens the edges and makes this a divine bubble of scent to become lost in.\n\nEveryone should try Shalimar at least once. There is a reason it's so iconic and thoroughly loved!", "42": "When I first started getting into fragrances, I always stayed clear of this. I was terrified of it. The bottle, the idea, the reputation, etc..it just didn't bode well to me. It seemed like a monster that was too big for me to tame and domesticate. \n\nThen, I happened to be discussing signature fragrances with my mother. And she mentioned that my late Aunt Peggy wore Shalimar. She died when I was 4, and she was the first family member I ever remember dying. She was such a bad ass woman. She didn't let anyone get the best of her. She was confident, brash, and warm. She didn't have a funeral, but rather an upbeat wake with an open bar. Aunt Peggy is such an emblem of confidence to me...and having the knowledge that she wore this made me march right up to Macys and buy a 1.7oz EDT.\n\nLet's put aside reformulations, concentrations, etc, talk for my review. I'm not enough of a snob to complain about useless stuff like that. \n\nIt opens with a strong, pungent smoky citrus. There's a hint of vanilla, but nothing dramatic. Once it settles, there's an intense curtain of leather and civet. There's also a very prominent burst of opoponax. I'm in absolute love with the drydown on my skin, even though I've never before managed to wear a heavy leather or civet scent. EVER. But the intense, smoky, powdery, animalic bomb is TO DIE FOR on my skin. Not only does this perfume remind me of my dear Aunt Peggy, but it also brings back fond memories of my local incense shop. It's smoky, spicy, and has a hard-to-describe quality...it's not quite \"sweetness,\" but the feeling the myrrh has to it. Rich, opulent, thick...but not syrupy. I can't think of a word to capture it. But it's incredibly sensual and feral.\n\nPure perfection.", "43": "Shalimar is a dangerous elixir - it makes my heart race so fast I'm afraid it might stop. But at least I'd die in absolute bliss.\n\nIt's no exaggeration to say I haven't encountered anything quite so sensual and evocative in the world of perfumery. Shalimar truly is such a mysterious yet warm and inviting scent.\n\nI won't go into the notes in detail, because noses far better trained than mine have already explained Shalimar's depths exquisitely. But I will say that I love the contrast between the two monumental notes in Shalimar - the bright, spicy bergamot and the rich, creamy, but never too sweet vanillan. Shalimar is truly the exemplar of the Guerlinade accord, perfected.\n\nIt's also very much unisex by today's standards, particularly in an era accustomed to masculine gourmands. There's nothing at all dated about it - it truly is timeless. It is also very versatile. You could wear it to the office, to the movies, on a date, to a funeral, to your wedding, to the club, on vacation in an old, romantic city - you get the drift.\n\nLongevity is stunning. I get more than 12 hours of wear, with the first six to eight hours giving at least a couple of metres of projection. After that, it sits close to the skin but retains its richness, which is perfect for nuzzling your nose into when you need a little lift.\n\nShalimar is a stunning example of the perfumer's art and a must in any collection. Pure, unadulterated bliss.", "44": "There are perfumes, and there is Shalimar. It`s the masterpiece of perfume industry. Pure art. I don`t like citruses in perfumes, but Shalimar is the perfect blend of citrus notes, flowers and spice.What is the best thing about this gem is that it constantly changes. The vanilla dry down is just perfect. This is a perfume for ladies and strong women who know what they want and don`t care about other people`s opinion. It`s heavy, it`s bold, it`s unique.

Working and dancing modes can be accompanied with this one. \nWhile L'Instant Magic's bee bottle serves it's gentle side very well during light pilates exercises, Shalimar is the one who comes with me during fiery dancing lessons at night. Let's not forget that every young flapper girl in 1920s wore this fragrance and they were far from being grandmas. \n\nWhen it comes to business, I must say that Shalimar held my head up high during the first pandemic lockdown. Being forced to work from home, I knew that I'll need something to soothe my anxious mind and focus. Can anyone spray Shalimar and after that deliver a sloppy project while wearing PJ's at the same time?

It isn't a fougere scent.  \nI received Oud For Glory this week, and busy giving it a good test. The lavender is practically non-existent, mate, probably revealing itself only ever so slightly upon first spray. But you will get the rest of the notes listed above more prominently.  \nYou know, I think this is going to be my review of this wonderful Lattafa offering\ud83d\ude0a \nIt is incredibly, amazingly so close to Oud For Greatness. The mind boggles how the folks at Lattafa achieve such proficient clones of more pricey fragrances. I have worn Oud For Greatness once, and I think you good people will be delighted to learn that Oud For Glory actually does three things better - the opening, the additional 10ml. juice, and the price.  \nThe opening of Glory is not as heavy; it is more pleasant than Greatness. Half an hour in, and there is no difference I can tell between the two fragrances. Please read cowboylacroix's review below - he's done a fine job of breaking it down better than I could. \nAs for the price, here in South Africa Initio's Oud For Greatness is R5960, which is about $400; Lattafa's Oud For Glory is R329, around $22. One is 18 times more expensive, and virtually no discernible difference in the scent or performance. I got over 15 hours with Oud For Glory yesterday, and even after showering I was getting subtle whiffs of it as I drifted off to sleep. \nThis is a wonderful purchase. A fantastic clone. Oud For Greatness was never great enough to justify the exorbitant spend. I really like the scent a lot, but there was never any goosebumps or walking on clouds for me. I'm just grateful we have Lattafa around. They have knocked this one out the park, and produced what I consider to be a better fragrance than the original. I would happily pay another $22 for Oud For Glory. \nThe presentation is top drawer, too. How they manage this level of class at such a low price is beyond me. \nEdit: Wearing Oud For Glory today - a rainy, cold day on the east coast of South Africa - and this fragrance is singing\u2b50 I am thrilled to have purchased a back-up bottle\ud83d\udc96", "1": "It's not my intention to offend anyone, but let all those who paid hundreds of dollars for a brand that put their investment into packaging and ad far more than the juice itself and charge us people their blood money, be happy with their purchase and complain about this fragrance how synthetic it smells.\nFor me, I'd never buy a bottle of PDM and Initio and would never consider them niche brands when it comes to the art of perfumery and respecting their customers.\nOud for glory is amazing enough for me to be busy with the scent and understand you don't have to pay big money to get a decent juice. \nStay safe, cheers.", "2": "First day wearing this and one of my friends (girl) told me I smelled supper addictive right after hugging me hello. She could not wait for me to tell her the name and send her the link to purchase my perfume.  \nEven though this is listed as more masculine than feminine my skin pulls the sweeter side of this fragrance and I am able to pull it off without any issues. \nThis is awesome and sexy, ladies don\u2019t be afraid to wear it because this is so much better than 99% of fragrances found in department stores. \nSillage is strong and I didn\u2019t have to bring a decant like I always do with most fragrances because you will never need to reapply when you\u2019re out. \nEdit: On my second night wearing this a guy friend told me he could not believe how amazing I smelled and that this is the best thing he has smelled in a long time.

Glorious!! \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc95 \nI'd say blind buy, you won't regret it", "4": "This smells pretty much the same in the air as Oud For Greatness after about 30 minutes, has excellent performance and a great price (about 55 dirhams/$15/100 ml in the UAE). The most significant difference is that the opening of Glory is slightly more harsh (but not more harsh than say the opening of CDNI), the saffron seems to stay longer on my skin too, and it is also slightly more masculine (as I think the oud accord is not the same). I am very familiar with Greatness as I have had samples and smelled it a fair amount in the air in Dubai - even through masks! - and it's been a strong Like but not a Love for me for some time. \nOud For Glory smells somewhat better in the air than on skin and I have noticed that it 'cleans-up' a bit more after some sprays through the nozzle - similar to what happens with CDNI too. As far as clones go - if that's what rocks your boat - this is up there with the best of them. Furthermore, the price to value ratio on this is just incredible. The only provisos - you really need to enjoy this scent profile (not everybody does despite the high ratings) and you need to be careful not to overspray. It can get cloying - like the Initio. Personally, I wish Oud For Greatness itself came in 30/50 ml bottles - 90 ml is just waayy too much anyway....... \nLastly, I am sure this will get a lot of criticism from people who have shelled out for Oud For Greatness only to realise that it is yet another high profile scent that is fairly easy to duplicate. That's not to negate their criticism in advance, just to suggest that it may be coming from a particular context...."}, "150": {"0": "A dark, electric lavender backed by patchouli to create an edgy fougere accord that\u2019s both modern and a little bit of a throwback. It\u2019s big, bold, and really beautiful. I know everyone compares this to Sauvage, and while I get the tonal similarities (bergamot, patchouli, ambroxan), they really are pretty distinct scents. Sauvage\u2019s opening is both sharp and airier, less grounded in dark lavender, and honestly with a less realistic bergamot, but with its peppery notes already in place. That pepper carries Sauvage quickly into its post-fresh drydown which is rough, peppery, a bit sweaty, and with a distinct dryer sheet \u201cpuff\u201d effect. Whereas Carbon spends a lot of time in its rich bergamot-lavender mode, bolstered by patchouli and metallic accents, before sliding into a smooth patchouli dry down. It lacks the scratchy woody-amber base of Sauvage, and honestly beyond an initial family similarity, the two go down different roads. \nCarbon strikes me as the smoother and more refined of the two, smelling a bit more natural, but it doesn\u2019t offer the Janus faces of Sauvage\u2019s distinct fresh-then-rough transition. Sauvage has never read to me as a fougere, whereas Carbon certainly does. I like both, but while Sauvage is still a sort of b\u00eate noire for me that attracts and repels, Carbon pretty much just has me swooning. To me, a more apt comparison for Carbon is MFK Masculin Pluriel, as both are decidedly modern, patchouli-grounded takes on a fougere, and both feature beautiful lavender notes. Carbon is the richer and bolder of the two, however. Definitely recommended for those with modern/edgy sensibilities but sympathy for classic vibes.", "1": "Prada Luna Rossa Carbon Men EDT opens with a moderate projection of bergamot and pepper. The opening is bright, sharp, intense, sour, sparkly, and very pleasant, the fragrance comes across as sporty, refreshing, and very appealing. The initial projection is moderate; the pepper helps to improve the projection. A moment after the opening the mid notes come up, they appear to support the opening notes rather than carving a space for themselves. The lavender adds a faint floral touch that softens a bit the citrus edges; the soil tincture adds an earthy note, almost green that enhances the bergamot; the metallic tone feels like a box of metallic tools or a box of metallic silverware, a curious and noticeable note. The coal feels just like, coal, a slightly smoky, burnt wood-like note that blends well with the pepper found in the opening. The watery notes are not prominent. Finally, Prada Luna Rossa Carbon reaches its dry-down and the ambroxan comes up creating a musky-lemony and slightly powdery note but very projecting note, it ramps up projection. The patchouli listed as a base note is a faint green fresh touch. The fragrance has some noticeable opening to dry-down change, the opening is citrusy, sharp, sour, but as time passes, the citrus note takes one step down, letting the ambroxan to take the lead of the fragrance with a musky-lemony note that seems to create a continuous opening to dry-down bergamot line. Once Prada Luna Rossa Carbon Men EDT has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a moderate projection, musky lemony ambroxan, and peppery fragrance with some metallic, earthy, powdery, and very soft floral tones. The fragrance feels casual, elegant, energizing, exotic, fragrant, fresh, slightly green, inviting, masculine, modern, nicely-blended, playful, refreshing, sharp, slightly smokey, sour, spicy, sporty, versatile, zesty, and very pleasant. \nCATEGORY: Aromatic Fougere (2017 Daniela (Roche) Andrier).\nBATCH REVIEWED: 2020 (#91131).\nWOW RATING: 10/10.

This fragrance smells almost identical to Sauvage, but I absolutely LOVE it. I'm not too sure why this is - maybe because it's much less aggressive? Smoother? Better blended? I tried this in John Lewis today and immediately fell in love. So good.", "4": "I bought a sample of this and instantly loved the smell, as it takes the Sauvage DNA and makes it more tame, smooth, and less obnoxious in the ambroxan department. The smell is intoxicating and I get compliments from people every time I wear it.  \nWhat really worried me was all the negative reviews bashing this stuff's performance. I don't know about other people's bottles, but mine is an early 2019 batch and the stuff performs great. With three sprays, I get around 8 hours of longevity on my skin, even more on my clothes and it projects well for the price, as I still catch whiffs of it in the air several hours after spraying.  \nOverall, this stuff is beautiful and I'd 100% recommend checking this out if you're looking for a clean, sophisticated scent that works for all occasions, although the note breakdown may be too light and fresh-smelling to wear during winter months (I prefer my winter fragrances to be thick and warm, something like Spicebomb or Prada Luna Rossa Black).  \nOverall: 9/10, all-age, all-season scent."}, "151": {"0": "So, I actually own it, a 125ml bought locally at Douglas. Not a troll here. \nThe opening is strong. The iris is not super strong - it's most about the pineapple and coconut sandalwood based combo, but the iris smells like the one in Le Male le Parfum. Looks like the le Parfum flankers are goinng to be stronger with the addition of iris. Like Allure Edition Blanche this is complimented by sandalwood in the base, introducing creamy, sweet, gourmand, soapy vibe. The sandalwood, coconut, and pineapple mix gives a very apparent and strong Pi\u00f1a Colada smell. \nThe way the sandalwood mixes with iris, woodsy notes and summer character makes it a sweet, creamy, woody, soapy vibe. I kid you not - this smells like Dove made a Pi\u00f1a Colada fragranced soap. \nI can't say for the performance - i just bought it. I will update this review with the performance as soon as I test it sufficiently (can I have an upvote please ;) ?)\nRight now it seems like a strong projection for two hours and moderate later with about 7 hours performance (then becoming a skin scent) and a nice sillage for 3-4. \nThis is a sweet summer fragrance loaded with cream, soap, coconut, pineapple - a creamy pi\u00f1a colada. A Dove pi\u00f1a colada fragranced soap. Not office safe I think - a bit too playful \nSummer, beach, fun time I think is the best.", "1": "I did a review of this a while back on my YouTube and realized I forgot to share how I feel about it with all you fine folks here at fragrantica! \nIt's really different if you compare it to the original and I was surprised (in a good way) about the direction they took it. It's way deeper and heavier than the original with a focus on something woody, sweet with the sandalwood and vanilla and that coconut. There are more nuances to its sweet side than in the original and thus, the coconut comes across as a bit different as well. \nI like it a lot. And it has grown on me even more since my review of it. And it seems like people around me love it even more since I had quite a few compliments when wearing it. \nI usually finish a full bottle of Le Beau every single summer and I have a feeling my 75ml will be at least half full by the end of this summer. And.. Due to it's more deep kind of blend I will definitely use it a lot throughout the year.", "2": "What I didn't expect was its very fruity opening.\nGenerally I know perfumes in which pineapple is associated with metallic notes, so that it almost disappears. Here the cypress sustains this note but neither obscures nor mineralizes it, therefore is very perceptible.\nThis version of Le Beau Le Parfum (Edp Intense) is much more masculine than Le Beau, despite the presence of iris and tonka that I feel both faintly.\nCoconut also struggles to emerge but helps to soften the base of the perfume, which takes on subtly amber shades. Predominantly, on my female skin the cypress is the main note for a good portion of time, until the drydown that fades into a wonderful soft cloud, slightly almondy, that I can't stop smelling.\nStrangely, clothes imprison instead a fruity note similar to mango.\nMy good impression is that an excellent job and research are behind it so that overall the fragrance took on more decisive shades and a much more refined taste. For also an even more contrast between top notes and drydown, compared to the previous version.\nAs if usual simple and commonly used notes were in new blend for a more modern symphony.\nI have owned it for a day and currently I've got and express a very positive judgment.", "3": "LOVE this, and it\u2019s totally unisex.\nWoodier/earthier and smoother than the original while still retaining the coconut. Wish the pineapple in the opening lasted a little longer, and in fact the opening reminds me of Mugler\u2019s Angel Iced Star, but it\u2019s short-lived and becomes very amber and coconut wood dominant. \nCan\u2019t go wrong with it.", "4": "The best way to describe this uber unique scent is that it is CREAMY!!!

But as we all know, loving a perfume's ingredients does not necessarily mean you will love the scent itself. In fact, I find that I am pretty picky and I mostly feel disappointed with scents I try. This one is a big, surprising, joyful, sexy hit. \nI loved the original Narciso EDP, as did my husband. It was unusual, radiant, enticing but not overwhelming, and I received many compliments. This poudr\u00e9e version has a stronger floral emphasis and I clearly detect jasmine (whereas I found the original's florals very abstract and difficult to pull apart) and it is a jasmine that stays pretty true, without disintegrating past the top note into a synthetic mess, which I found a problem with the orange blossom in the For Her EDP.  \nIt is more delicate, more floral and more feminine than the original. However, they both have that incredible radiant effect - you think you have some polite, everyday pefume and then the next thing you know, everyone in the room has dilated pupils and everyone's temperature has just gone up - everyone's except the cool customer wearing the scent that's gently crawling up everyone's skin. \nI liked the analogy that this is part cashmere jumper and part leather trousers.

I would almost not have tried this if it hadn't been recommended in the forums because the marketing for this line is so cringey, now I'm glad I overcame my prejudice. This is relatively simple and linear, but gorgeous and unique. \nPrincess is a very sweet gourmand, a fluffy cloud of vanilla and marshmallows. I think the sweetness is very smooth here. The green tea really shines on my skin and lends freshness to the composition, it contrasts so nicely with the sweetness. I can smell the lemon, ginger and jasmine too, but only as very slight accents. The overall effect is an olfactory equivalent to a matcha latte with vanilla whipped cream or those green tea cheesecake drinks. \nPrincess can easily be worn in the daytime as it's soft and fluffy and not loud or especially sexy, but it has a nice creamy texture and doesn't come across as thin or weak.  \nI see that many have compared this to other sweet fragrances, but I don't think Princess is that close to any of them.

It's a diet gourmand: I get \nstraightforward marshmallow (nothing gooey, nothing burnt, nothing powdery) and fresh green tea. The freshness from the tea and ginger is definitely there but it's not at all jarring or sharp-- to my nose, it keeps this far far away from cloying. This is not groundbreaking but it is different in that it's extremely wearable and missing any of the heavy gourmand notes that make perfumes go saccharine or offensive. No praline, no straight up sugar, no dulce de leche, etc.. nothing controversial here. It's an airy and fluffy fragrance, sort of in the vein of Cloud, but creamer, smoother, and simpler. I love it. \nThis is a weird/specific reference...but if any 90s babies here remember the Disney channel ~original~ Wish Upon A Star, I picture Katherine Heigl's outfit in the opening scene when I smell this: white crop top, lavender mini, and light frosted lips. lol. \nPerformance is up to 8 hours on me with moderate projection."}, "154": {"0": "It is a very feminine, warm and cosy scent.

That's straight praline, this is honey...\nJust because it's strong and sweet does not mean it is the same scent as other sweet bombs like Black Opium and Bonbon.... that's a statement made by snobbish anti-sweet people, c'mon... not all sweets are created equal. \nNOW rant over, as for the fragance... I'm still on the fence about it.\nFirst time I tried I hated it, I found it very synthetic and sharp and threw the testing card away immediately.\nI was still curious about it, and tried it again, this time on my hand. It smells very different, this is one of those you need to try on you skin and let it develop. \nThe opening is still very strong, but a few minutes later it's all about honey and I looooooove honey, on my skin is not synthetic at all! I find it a little powdery, which reminds me a little bit of the JPG Classique which I dislike.\nThis is not a super young perfume, it's 25+ at best.\nIt goes with the brand, is at the same time classy but skanky, I don't know how to explain it. But it sure belongs with a well dressed scandalous woman, like the add suggests... now I understand the bottle and the concept. \nIt is powerful, I washed my hand twice and it's still very strong."}, "155": {"0": "I got this one so wrong when I first got it. I found it too sweet and powdery. I put it away as a potential swap or sell.  \nBut.  \nI got it out a few weeks ago and I can\u2019t believe I almost got rid of it. It is so good. Yes it is sweet, yes it is powdery, but it is also so spicy and the tobacco is on another level. This is so cozy, so masculine, so wearable. Perfect for fall and winter. The only problem now is that I feel less confident about getting rid of some of the scents I don\u2019t like, what if they pull a Chergui on me?!  \nThis one is great. Get it.", "1": "This is a perfume that needs heat to really bloom. In cool weather it is light honey with a very sharp woody note (the balsalmic I assume). It's nice, but it's sort of flat and the notes feel like they are bumping awkwardly against one another. \nBut let the temperature get above 80F and everything changes. Chergui turns into liquid gold. It's like bathing in raw, natural honey in an old tobacco drying shed in the summer. It's deep and rich and sensuous and it sings. It keeps pumping out the glory even while I and my horse are sweating through our workout under the hot sun, we still smell wonderful. Wait until summer, spritz a bit of this on and sink into luxury. \nI love it. But I suspect this is a love it or loath it sort of fragrance. So be warned, shy and retiring it is not.", "2": "Unisex, like a lot of fragrances, maybe all fragrances; and it's not a joke.\nPerhaps some people fear to be not masculine enough... Pathetic when it becomes an obsession.\nWear what you want.", "3": "This is the scent that got me back into perfume after a 2 year hiatus in which I was fragrance free. Ironically I bought this tobacco heavy scent to celebrate quitting smoking. I went to the perfume house in Portland looking for something special and smelled a lot of different scents. They have the Lutens out to play with along with a booklet of notes as determined by the owner who is a certified nose. Not knowing anything about the line I started flipping through the book and sniffing the bottles, spraying them on cotton balls etc. Chergui was listed as hay sugar, tobacco, honey and perhaps 1-2 other notes, no flowers though and I was intrigued but couldn't find the bottle. I asked the saleswoman in the store where it was and her eyes twinkled a bit and she grabbed it from the back, almost empty and told me they were out of stock. It ended up being the one fragrance I tested on my wrist, I thanked her and told her I would be back if I liked it and left the store to grab some lunch.  \nWalking down the street on that sunny fall day is such a clear and wonderful memory. I kept lifting my wrist and breathing in deeply. About 1 1/2 hours later I knew I wanted to have it. I called the shop and the SA instantly knew who I was and told me \"I knew you would be back for this one, it's so special and my absolute favorite\". They put me on the waiting list, 1 week later I had the bottle in my hand and was reunited with an old love of perfume. I love this fragrance, smokey, sweet, yum.", "4": "Chergui comes from Arabic Sharqi, which is the name given, in Morocco, to the wind that blows from the Sahara desert. In Arabic, it means \"from the East\" and, in the case of the perfume, has no connection with the island of the same name, located in Tunisia. \nSerge Lutens is passionate about Morocco and chose the place as his house. Many of his inspirations come from there. In the case of Chergui, Lutens defines as: \"a fire fanned by the wind; a desert in flames\". \nThe composition brings hay sugar, Iris, rose, honey, incense, tobacco leaves, amber, musk, and sandalwood. For those who don't know, there are some types of hay with high sugar content, like the Hay of sugarcane and the Hay of Greece (fenugreek). In the case of the latter, its seeds have an aroma very similar to the aroma of maple syrup (the one used in pancakes). \nAgain, Christopher Sheldrake managed to interpret the ideas of Serge in an exquisite manner. Chergui, the wind, passes over the Atlas Mountains, going down by the coastal plains heading towards the Atlantic Ocean, completely dry. And the result of Chergui, the perfume, is exactly that: a dry and warm blow on the skin that will only become calm once the dust goes down. \nOnce sprayed on my skin, I thought: \"I want a bottle now\"! The first impact brings a rose honeydew and an iris that is not powdery as usual, but floral and with nuances of violets. Suddenly, without notice, arises an aroma of honey and a creamy tobacco, warmed by the amber. At this stage, it reminded me a lot of The Dreamer (Versace) and of the reason why this scent is so appreciated, even though being part of a commercial brand. This is a great tobacco! And this was the longest stage of evolution on my skin. From there, about three hours after I applied, Chergui changes again and, as the wind, loses strength and becomes smoother, although dry. The incense and the sandalwood blend and create a nuance that resembles a soft leather. \nHowever, I read many comments that show that in addition to evolving a lot, Chergui can also be mutant. The comparisons go from Obsession (Calvin Klein) and Tobacco Vanille (Tom Ford) to Bvlgari Black (Bvlgari) and Eau des Baux (L'Occitane). For some people proved to be very feminine. On my skin, I found it more masculine. \nAnyway, this beautiful perfume \u2013 launched in 2001 (not in 2005, according to Wikipedia) \u2013 manages to be elegant, strong, seductive, and different. It's the kind of perfume that people stop you on the streets to ask its name.\nJust a reminder: Have I already said I want a bottle?"}, "156": {"0": "This is really a deceiving fragrance in many ways. It's supposed to be a sports fragrance, but it's not. Comes out with an all out citrus bomb that smells like lemon, but there's no lemon in it. Has an aquatic note that doesn't seem to exist. A pepper note that is so faint you'd miss it and begins to transform into this almost vanilla drydown. Then when you think you have it figured out it releases a beautiful white musk, vetiver, and amber drydown. Finally when you think it's all done, that lemon note that doesn't exist bites again and performs the final magic trick. Don't know what the hell happened, but you want to see it again. I can't imagine someone not liking this. Exceptional fragrance.", "1": "Chanel\u2019s Allure Homme Sport has to be one of my all time favorite fragrances for men! As a woman I definitely like fresh scents that have a little sweetness to them on a man. I love the sweet orange and salty sea top notes. I smell a little spice and it could be the pepper, but it smells like cinnamon to me which is fantastic and the base it definitely a warm vanilla. I think that the notes blend so well together in this fragrance so that it is not too candy sweet nor too sharp smelling. As much as I like fresh citrus scents, there is nothing appealing about a man smelling like a lemon bomb or a Clorox wipe what is so strong it burns your nose. I personally love Allure Homme Sport and every time I smell it on a man I always stop to give a compliment!", "2": "Chanel Allure Homme Sport is probably the best blind buy a human being can purchase. It is the most balanced scent I have come in contact with. No one will be offended and you will get compliments across the board. \nIt starts off with a nice citrus blast that is perfectly blended (ignore all the synthetic hoopla) and as it dries down becomes creamy, sweet and a little earthy. The only problem I have with this, is that this is no more a sports fragrance as Buffalo Chicken has Buffalo. It is a very well blended, creamy dreamscicle that develops well. \nMy only problem is that it doesn't project a bunch and for such a great scent I want everyone to enjoy it :o)", "3": "A man wears Allure Homme Sport by Chanel. He comes into the room. And.. It's enough 1 second to smell this scent and you wanna rip off his clothes and sniff all that powerful and incredible masculine scent. \nThere isn't anything better than men's neck + Allure Homme Sport. it's absolutely magnet of women.", "4": "If I could only wear one fragrance for the remainder of my life, this may very well be it. So far.  \nA citrusy and refreshing opening gives way to a surprisingly rich, intoxicating dry down without sacrificing the freshness factor.  \nI've been wearing it to the gym in the sweltering midst of summer, and to formal events in the heart of winter, and everything in between - never has it felt inappropriate.  \nAll I could ask is that the performance was a bit better."}}}
