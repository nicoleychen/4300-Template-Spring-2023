The result is a scent that we\'d imagine has the exact same balance of elegant classicism and sexy modernity in 2019 as it did more than half a century ago.

Alchemico, as the name appropriately suggests, is a fusion of all that Mazzolari was, is, and will be, a suitably dreamlike, yet contemporary, incense scent with classical leanings but thoroughly modern flourishes. \r\nAlchemico opens with an instantly compelling top note combining fresh, young rose with smooth cypress and a jolt of energized, crisp pepper, all blended seamlessly with compelling effect. In the heart, the main incense note hits a steady beat almost immediately, playing off the pepper to feel both languidly smokey and energetic all at once, while an earthy geranium note fleshes out the incense\'s rougher, deeper facets. In the drydown, this is accentuated even more with a spicy, grassy vetiver note, but just when it seems like Alchemico might go too far towards the earth, a soft, warm amber sends it back a',' Rose, cypress, pepper, incense, geranium, vetiver, amber','https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32824.jpg?width=400&404=product.png\r'),('Alessandro Eau de Toilette','Mazzolari',' Bitter almond, sweet honey and a soft powdery notes give Alessandro a dreamy, rich quality that zips you away to a bedroom filled with satin sheets, candles and exotic candies.

At the base is a vanilla-like warmth with a kiss of sophistication.

Deceptively simple in composition, All That Matters is one of those fragrances that merges with your skin and reads more like an aura than a perfume. This simplicity works because of the quality of the ingredients. Any musk lover can tell you that not all musk is created equal. The musk at the heart of All That Matters is smooth, with a silken lightness that is almost airy. This particular musk is also very rare and prohibitively expensive – therefore it is infrequently used in commercial fragrances except in tiny amounts. In this handcrafted blend, however, it is the star player -- paired with gorgeous and compelling sandalwood oil from East India and the delicate crispness of lily of the valley. Quiet and compelling.

A fresh mint top note poises in the air like a conductor\'s baton, soon giving way to swirls of smoke, roots, and moist green leaves. Aromas of fresh-turned earth and wild vegetation join lavender and herbs at the heart. Then, as it falls from its crescendo, Allegretto settles on a warm base of cedar wood, vanilla, and benzoin.

Opening with a joyous burst of sweet, fresh almond supported by creamy orange blossom, Almond Harmony seamlessly layers on a gorgeous floral bouquet in the heart, weaving the sweetness of ylang and the distinctly almond tones of heliotrope with smooth jasmine and powdery iris.

The yuzu and lime in the opening are beautifully crystalline and sharply realistic, and the citrus stays crisp and sparkling as the scent evolves.  A brisk, hyper-real soap note emerges, with subtle hints of something industrial underneath. This has the stark feel of an abandoned city – a landscape carved in glass and steel, spare and stripped clean and angular, with empty monorail tracks slicing through the sky.  The chilly aldehydes are countered by warm cedar and the dry and clarifying scent of hinoki, the prized cypress that grows only in Japan. Hinoki wood is used to make the finest soaking baths and it has a distinctive, incense-like scent – airy, but haunting.

It is an unusual concept for a perfume, but one that works so beautifully it\'s been shortlisted for the Independent Perfume category in the Art and Olfaction Awards 2017. \r\nAltruist opens with fresh, sparkling notes of bergamot, lemon, and ginger representing the swirls of light green and aquamarine colors on the painting, while the warmer slashes of red and orange on the canvas are translated via the explosive heat of cracked black pepper and nutmeg.

Saffron and henna warm up the opening and there are soft woods and musk in the mix, but mostly there is rose. Not a bouquet of roses or a rose garden, but a single, perfect, magical rose that we can envision clearly --- it\'s the enchanted rose in“Beauty and the Beast”ť floating in its glass dome, wondrous and eternal and glowing.

A deeply sensual rose, fleshed out with icy Sicilian lemon and rich Indian jasmine, stars opposite a labdanum and amber-accord combination that explores every sweet, resinous possibility of the ingredients, a syrupy-rich base that rests underneath the florals rather than drenching them. And the sharp, sexy musk that could be considered the Mancera trademark makes an appearance two, grounding the amber accord just enough to make it year-round wearable.

But an unexpectedly striking note of rose manages to feel both lush and thorny, and raw, spicy vetiver splices with stout cedarwood to deliver a powerful bite when least expected. Amber lovers, you\'ll fall head over heels for this rich, creative and ferocious elixir.

Expensive this may be, but Roja Dove puts his money where his mouth is. Taking a regally sour, spicy Indian oud, he buries it deep within the folds of a jammy rose, and then tucks the whole thing into the pulpy insides of a Moroccan fig. Almost obscenely rich and opulent at first, it wears like the inside of a red velvet cloak lined in ermine. \r\nBut look closely and you will see the artful balance between sweet and sour, dusty and moist, sharp and smooth. There is structure and discipline within the avalanche of richness. Birch tar and incense resins and gums provide a smoky fade-out that proves to be excellent ballast for the jammy sweetness up top.

A molten dark chocolate note gets buffed out into an almondy haze of tonka bean, hints of hay and roast hazelnut flirting with the cacao to give it a slightly bitter, non-edible edge that sets it apart from other gourmands. The fact that this delicious scent is all-natural and artisanal means that it\'s a guilt-free indulgence. \r\nDespite the almost comically simple name, Amber Chocolate is not a simple affair. There\'s a naughty musk or patchouli here that gives the texture a resinous, grainy aftertaste, like gianduja rolled up in a veiny Cuban tobacco leaf.

It\'s an increasingly rare star player in perfume, so who in their right mind would put it into an ordinary citrus-and-woods cologne? It seems Bortnikoff would, and the results turn out to be far from ordinary. It doesn\'t hurt that the citrus in question is eye-poppingly fresh, an arresting blend of juicy bergamot, zesty lemon, sweet orange, and deliciously tart grapefruit, making the mouth water and the senses ignite. And once ignited, we find ourselves primed for the most gorgeously comfortable blend of ambergris and woods we could ever hope for- salty and gently animalic, to be sure, but moreover simply aglow with a luminous warmth that drills through every level of artifice in your memory to connect with the',' Bergamot, Lemon, White and Pink Grapefruit, Sweet Orange, Cardamom, Frangipani, Jasmine Sambac, Virginia Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Grey and Brown Ambergris, Oud from Sri Lanka, Bouya Oud, Vanilla','https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png\r'),('Amber Eau de Parfum','Rook Perfumes',' When we say we love amber scents, we don\'t just mean the traditional blend of labdanum and vanilla that are so often considered the definitive \"amber\" note in perfume.

It opens with a genuinely hypnotic smoke note- sweetened with saffron, but rich and animalic, coaxing out the syrupy amber-maple heart like semi-fossilized resin seeping from ancient bark. A tonka bean base adds a touch of familiar vanillic tone, but stripped of the typically creamy dessert trappings.

Instead, Amber Kiso is a vision of sunlight piercing the tranquility of an ancient forest, the brightness of fresh moss against the unique strength of cedar and hinoki. A tendril of temple incense, pure and contemplative, winds itself throughout the heart of the scent, while a clean, smooth leather represents the traditional bushi armor of a samurai.

Byredo\'s homage to the French dandy reflects this mercurial nature with its multiple olfactory dimensions.\r\nA gentle sweetness lies at the heart of Baudelaire, with hyacinth warmed by amber and a touch of fruit. This sentimental center gives way to the aromatics of caraway, patchouli, and juniper berries, with their green whiff of the brisk outdoors. Baudelaire\'s base truly provides a counterpoint to its initial warmth, the way that his poetry often launches into philosophy: sensuality gives way to aridity, with a dry, incense-y base of leather, patchouli and papyrus.\r\nEarthy yet worldly, warm yet sophisticated, Baudelaire is as elegant as a dandy\'s walking stick.',' Juniper berry, Black pepper, Caraway, Incense, Hyacinth, Leather, Papyrus, Patchouli, Black amber','https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png\r'),('Bay Rum Cologne','Gilbert Henry',' This cologne is made with the same great essential oil blend as the corresponding Bay Rum aftershave balm, but at a higher concentration.

Created for a dear friend\'s wedding, Soliani was inspired by“confetti”ť – the sugar coated almond candies served at weddings in Italy – and around the world.  You may know them better as Jordan almonds. This is not an easy, melt-in-your-mouth sort of candy. The sugarcoating is to convey the wish that the newlyweds\' life be more sweet than bitter and the beauty of these candies is that the almonds really do have a sharp bitterness that contrasts with the powdery sweetness. That beguiling contradiction is captured perfectly in this scent and leads into an absolutely gorgeous profusion of fresh orange blossoms, as if you were walking under a wedding bower.  Conafetto features an absolutely radiant version of fleur d\'oranger – a touch of honey, a touch of citrus and a bounty of ethereal white flowers.

Comme des Garcons\' Concrete is, straightforwardly enough, housed in a grey shell of poured concrete, but uniquely hand-formed. Freed from the streets beneath our feet, concrete becomes a material worthy of observation and appreciation. And the enclosed scent, too, reveals in its first puff what happens when stereotypes are shattered. \r\nThe first moments of Concrete are shocking – from this weighty concrete pebble, one would expect a harsh industrial scent, but instead, a cloud of soft-focused sherbert, melting in the street, greets the senses. This is Comme des Garcons at its most subtle, honed in on the slightest of details. In the ambiently fruity, lactonic haze, there\'s a metallic zing, contributed by rose oxide.

Summertime warmth emerges in the pulpy sweetness of mango and the smooth floral greenness of lily of the valley and lush rose, while autumn beckons from around the corner with crackling cedarwood and salty ambergris.

Black copal is heavy and rich, known for its bittersweet bay leaf scent; golden copal is as smooth and sweet as honey. \r\nHere, it is the good-natured sweetness of Mexican golden copal that gives this dry, incensey vanilla its edge. The faintly cinnamon-and-bay-leaf spiciness inherent in the resin is firmly underlined by a piquant pink pepper note that runs all the way down the spine of the scent to the base. Smoky mesquite woods keep the sultry Mexican vanilla powdery and elegant - no gluttony or sugared excess here. Instead, a dark cocoa-ish tone develops, giving the woody vanilla a dustiness reminiscent of the white ash left after the copal burns clean away. What\'s most impressive about Copala is its lightness and naturalness: compared to most other spicy vanilla orientals, the XinĂş rendition is positively monastic.',' Pink pepper, copal, mesquite, Mexican vanilla','https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png\r'),('Copper Eau de Parfum','Comme des Garcons',' Fiery red metal, yet cool to the touch.

Is this a photo-perfect capture of the actual smell of copper? Why would it be? Rather, this is the soul of copper, cool but conductive, presented for those with the distinctive style to resonate at the same frequency.

But where is the fun is labeling anyway? \r\nIt might be the subtle, unexpected salinity that makes this scent such an enigma, that sea breeze drifting through the formula, deftly weaving pepper, juniper, geranium, magnolia, musk and mace around the heart of Ukrainian coriander.

Cornaline, an ode to brightness and light and color, is no exception- by combining unexpected natural elements of spice, fruit, and florals, Lebreton delivers a dazzlingly bright scent that slowly, deliberately transitions into a twinkling twilight. \r\nCornaline opens with a distinctive and unforgettable note of carrot root, almost synthetic feeling in its uniqueness, the perfect lead-in to a cascade of fruits and flowers that radiate with distinctive and unforgettable color.

Now, with Corpse Reviver, Bruno Fazzolari has brought the spirit of Cadavre Exquis back to the mortal plane, but with a bit of rebalancing meant to let the disparate elements play nice together.

Cristina defies all expectation of a patchouli fragrance, and even those that thought they were not patchouli lovers will be proven wrong.',' Patchouli, labdanum, vanilla','https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png\r'),('Cruz Del Sur I Eau de Parfum','Xerjoff',' Inspired by the mystery and majesty of the untouched tribes of the South American jungle, Xerjoff\'s Cruz Del Sur series radiates with compellingly fresh energy and the thrill of exploration. For the first entry in the duo, we find ourselves in the canopy of the rainforest, the air rich with the smell of ripening fruit, wild, spicy vegetation, and the rum from our expedition packs. The raw power of the animals that rule this domain is expressed through powerful doses of leather and castoreum, while the untold riches of the lost city we search for comes through in a deep base of labdanum, myrrh and amber. We may be lost- or we may be closer to finding ourselves than ever before. Wild and refined, exotic and comforting, Cruz Del Sur I is a treasure unto itself.',' Rum, bergamot, grapefruit, cedar, cinnamon, dried fruits, cumin, labdanum, myrrh, castoreum, leather','https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51143.jpg?width=400&404=product.png\r'),('Cruz Del Sur II Eau de Parfum','Xerjoff',' Inspired by the mystery and majesty of the untouched tribes of the South American jungle, Xerjoff\'s Cruz Del Sur series radiates with compellingly fresh energy and the thrill of exploration. For the second of the duo, our journey takes us to the center of a flourishing mango grove, where the very air seems overflowing with mouthwatering tropical juiciness. Humming undercurrents of vibrantly green florals energize and excite, while rich, earthy vetiver and robust cedar remind us that the oldest and most powerful living things on the earth are the very trees that surround us. Our expedition has yet to locate the endless stores of gold we were promised, but we\'ve already found indescribable wealth in the heart of the jungle. Lovers of deep, rich, juicy fruit scents, rejoice- Cruz Del Sur II is a sumptuous delight.',' Mango, pineapple, apple blossom, floral bouquet, green leaves, vetiver, cedar, musk','https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51144.jpg?width=400&404=product.png\r'),('Crystal Pistil Eau de Parfum','D.S. and Durga',' D.S. & Durga takes the guessing game out of layering scents and offers us an easy solution to punch up any fragrance. The second release of their \"fragrance enhancers, \" these are a fun way to start experimenting with wearing multiple perfumes at a time. But don\'t let the tagline fool you- these are every bit their own stand alone fragrances,  addictively sheer but with enough presence to have strangers stopping you to ask,  \"what\'s that you\'re wearing?\" \r\nThe fragrance is a soft crystalline perfume that highlights the humid parts inside of a flower. A modern dewy orange blossom water inspired by the memory of a more traditional orange blossom water sprinkled in the air in a market on the back streets of Fez in Morocco. Crystal Pistil delivers a fresh aquatic floral vibe that lasts in all its crystalline glory.',' orange flower water, dew-on-petals, pink pepper, crystalized flower parts, Paradisone, jasmine water, civettone, white musks, ambrette seeds','https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/686085.jpg?width=400&404=product.png\r'),('Cuir - Les Nombres d\'Or Eau de Parfum','Mona di Orio',' Rarely do leather scents come across our path that put us in a state of delightful shock. Opening with a whiff of Gauloise-like smoke it quickly becomes toasted spices and sweet absinthe before the appearance of the leather. Neatly straddling the line between biker and Birkin bag, the leather is almost carnal in its depth. In these days of anodyne scents and trans-fat free lives this is a welcome walk on the wild side that on a man would be wonderful. On a woman? The only way to put it: Cuir is ruthlessly chic.',' Cardamom, Absinth, Leather, Cade, Resinoid Opoponax, Castoreum','https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png\r');
